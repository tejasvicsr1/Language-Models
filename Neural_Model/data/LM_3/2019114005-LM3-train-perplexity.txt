191. salinger said the work president	kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address	involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions	on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated	by russia's demands and proposals for the city	6840.3391373533905
192. the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov 8 election	were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who	charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally	illegal means	3651.663849401284

201. karns said it was a wrongful act	for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand	jury room	2838.07702858027
202. he said this constituted a very serious misuse	of the criminal court processes	788.9231046776088
203. actually the abuse of the	process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook	county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the	function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east	st louis sitting in cook county court	7310.357536466443

213. the aged care plan	similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a	fight on capitol hill	2839.8755399402917
214. it was defeated in congress last year	93.53288837559839
215. up to $37 a year	it would be financed by boosting the social security	payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now	paying such taxes	5183.265248734723
216. the social security payroll tax is now 6	per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4800	of pay per year	2731.9210229685896
217. the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to	$5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6	2373.800954125406
218. 25 per cent each	2.9530368312625
219. similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad	retirement system	1410.7013559063403
220. the payroll tax would actually rise	to 7	167.55898589164454
221. 5 per cent starting jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because	the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date	to pay for other social security costs	5636.6557865586165
222. officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would	amount to 1	946.4876946791073
223. 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would	run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963	2829.2770067050537
224. both figures would go	higher in later years	167.04919512430666
225. other parts of the kennedy health plan	would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over	the next 10 years	3502.0491397477795
226. these would be paid for out of general not payroll	taxes	498.6106148585417
227. the aged care plan carries these	benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad	retirement systems:  full payment of hospital bills for	stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would	pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days	7613.1591353367885

231. community visiting nurse services at home	for up to 240 days an illness	1179.1524806969178
232. the president noted that congress	last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical	bills of the needy aged	2311.3406013690274
233. he said his	plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish	to receive care at the taxpayers' expense but who are nevertheless	staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-	caused by an extended hospital stay	7010.704384347559
234. this is a very	modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said	and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any	malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals	3113.522037019592
235. this	is not a program of socialized medicine	250.76284852698183
236. it is a program of prepayment	of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed	1085.5527158337977

239. they would still	be paid by the patient	250.8166000209862
240. apart from the aged care plan the president's	most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships	and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools	2863.346850940251
241. the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools	cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need	for health care	4098.766482082628
242. moreover he said many qualified young people are	not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the	schooling costs	2036.9455870752015
243. the scholarship plan	would	provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal	to $1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students	3915.051025519814
244. the	schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships based on need	of up to $2000 a year per student	2021.8231538161697
245. in addition the government	would pay a $1000 cost of education grant to the schools for	each $1500 in scholarship grants	3044.145084275565
246. officials estimated the combined	programs would cost	5	167.25219676641382

252. in the child health field the president said he will recommend	later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau	2173.157412075521
253. he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national	child health institute	1176.524838646878
254. the president said	he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation	1093.0142896549467

258. the president said his proposals combine the indispensable	elements in a sound health program- people knowledge	services facilities and the means to pay for them	2603.5634643871344
259. as expected	congressional reaction to the message was along expected	lines	753.971437266438
260. legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under	the social security system criticized the president's plan	1263.7218692617153
261. those	who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message	757.5389895259234
262. senate	republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader	charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them	to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance	2844.4502675565623
263. halleck	said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair	trial first	1895.4490077810665
264. house speaker sam rayburn d tex	called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction	on its fate in the house	2476.4550236452014
265. acting hastily under white house pressure	the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nation's	federal housing chief	2618.235706039935
266. only 11 senators were on the floor	and there was no record vote	788.3178262479107
267. a number of scattered ayes and	noes was heard	392.56955784218815
268. customary senate rules were ignored in	order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing	and home finance agency	2322.615007035625
269. in the last eight years all	presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been	denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least	a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor	5948.347469344995
270. the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d	ore in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet	selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961	2722.3377145670406
271. the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting	of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been	the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual	understanding than in past meetings	5620.000809441352
272. this has been a working	session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed	along its route step by step and without dramatic changes	2876.320465358719
273. in oslo	the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine	attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems	3712.6720405305705
274. this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable	where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers	and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems	3229.8157837972985
275. the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated	by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other	allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances	that have brought these troubles about has been conspicious by	its absence	6687.032039649612
276. in the case of portugal which	a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council	should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been	a noticeable relaxation of tension	3849.6311468166978
277. the general remarkably courteous	explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been	no explosion in the council	2604.0370292098637
278. there should even be no more bitter surprises	in the un general assembly as to nato members' votes	since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that	in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance	4463.181536422237
279. canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt	to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato	locomotive	4085.8994707937845
280. even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against	atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance	is today closer to the nato line	2845.01124445013
281. on the negative	side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the	united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for	4468.619310744268
282. one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk's	speeches as inconclusive	941.667823494077
283. but he hastened to add that	if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusk's	analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the	west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly	fixed its policy	6676.861375101036
284. a certain vagueness may also	be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council	meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents	accredited	3212.6937777595317
285. the impression has nevertheless been	given during these three days despite mr rusk's personal popularity	that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat	tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn	than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application	to individual danger spots	7785.387612181689
286. the secretary of state	himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of	events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the	new administration in the past four months	3755.9878271334615
287. but where the core	of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only	reiterated the united states' profound attachment to the alliance	cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five	nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato's disposal in	european waters	6897.855721091813
288. the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated	a warning to the soviet union that the united states will	not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken	up by the council as a whole	4061.245859759872
289. the secretary's	greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization	that east-west friction wherever it take place around the	globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different	societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical	distance or lack of apparent connection	7198.622500046315
290. the annual spring	meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more deeper	and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use	of the organization for economic cooperation and development	as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries	and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the	maintenance of the nuclear deterrent	5447.050093706313
291. this increase in the	threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will	prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months	to come	4111.6722538464655
292. each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid	down but never completely fulfilled	1254.4749170325613
293. the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a	geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy	erupts for the first time	3713.5495186280086
294. there is little optimism here	that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table	than they were in military actions on the ground in laos	2968.1657285654665
295. the	united states state department officials explain now is mainly	interested in setting up an international inspection system which will	prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring	thailand and south viet nam	6092.274742903841
296. they count on the aid	of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve	this	1254.4385294364415
297. the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet	would not become communist dominated	1401.3428155005254
298. but it is apparent that no acceptable	formula has been found to prevent such a possibility	1251.2260289813614
299. the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire	in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the	cease-fire by the international control commission before participating	in the geneva conference	5471.985674505263
300. this is another of the modifications	of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled	to make	1724.7851467953035
301. it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to	basic errors made in the previous administration	2130.887854573821
302. its spokesmen	insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in	military and economic aid policies in the critical areas	2315.225962831393
303. but	with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the	communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:	how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy	decisions been in dealing with communist aggression	6063.815382014692
304. former	vice-president richard m nixon in detroit called for a	firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union	1570.9213973952205
305. he was critical	of what he feels is president kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory	1644.0539086057524
306. it does not take a gallup poll to	find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the	situation as republicans see it	2450.053747147523
307. they can hardly restrain themselves	from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been	in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in	cuba	4301.162993648154
308. one republican senator told this correspondent that he	was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the kennedy administration	on this score	2163.74373973392

619. pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original	13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district	of columbia from a commercial standpoint	4087.928553120767
620. but from a historic viewpoint	none can approach it	261.3783011224351

631. many spectators	will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square	opposite the white house	1885.209266541889
632. in this historic square are several	statutes but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen	andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans	3095.506643931874

640. what does 1961 offer in political and governmental	developments in mississippi	500.429227999445
641. even for those who have	been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past	is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political	future	4821.767503641505
642. this is largely because of the unpredictability of the	man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected	leader of its two million inhabitants- gov ross barnett	3334.3115739602026
643. barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public	administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only	keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well	4669.026597134007
644. consequently	it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction	the barnett administration will take in the coming year	2190.228826630006
645. be scramble	some predict the administration will settle down during	1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far	3485.898966055554
646. the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady	stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments	by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's	office	3948.9385324530535
647. there are many who predict that should barnett decide	to call the legislature back into special session it will really	throw his administration into a scramble	4095.2899949579346
648. certainly nobody	will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett	will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful	honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session	3664.142075518721
649. if barnett	doesn't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first	year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or	special session	4822.973843870588
650. the odds favor a special session more than	likely early in the year	789.5273098432822
651. legislators always get	restless for a special session	and if they start agitating	1187.3938666741687
652. barnett	is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure	501.4773383320373
653. the issue	which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive	problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six	to five to eliminate one congressional seat	4996.622251179869
654. with eyes focused	on the third congressional district the historic delta district and	congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting	battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers	from the delta have held in the legislature	4629.840753177347
655. mississippi's	relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads	during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight years	in the white house	4096.744024499068
656. split badly during the recent presidential	election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and	independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck	2719.6931056832414
657. and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together	1402.8779934000052
658. barnett as the titular head of the democratic	party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations	with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist	ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary	4145.251735400552
659. with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin	to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity	in the november election	3677.280644530149
660. now the picture is clouded and even	us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who	remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status	2856.499798826703
661. reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen	from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped	of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen	5134.243986487855
662. the gov jimmie h davis administration	appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor's	theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses	2738.608536716844
663. the	year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome	issue	1178.9065487253008
664. but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue-	that of finances in state government	1247.6449930286276
665. the transition from segregation	to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration	proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3	per cent	5167.62802788095
666. the administration has said the sales tax proposal	is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the	increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program	3234.8305223703637
667. but the	tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused	legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all	shortage of cash than to segregation	4996.545193920024
668. indeed the administration's curious position on the sales tax was	a major factor in contributing to its defeat	1569.1844482772667
669. the administration could	not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program	1410.349086660918
670. the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies	revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining	whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote	3437.094854947428
671. the	tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when	the legislature reconvenes	1871.67988666149
672. davis may use the tax bill as a	means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature	to normalcy	2036.972185761721
673. if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and	say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent	integration	3902.8105780307765
674. he could terminate special sessions of the legislature	166.39300507749408
675. actually	davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway	754.0626610226152
676. many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing	battle to block token integration	1258.1820156725587
677. this is not the sort	of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly	1419.931845973635
678. they would	like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is	something they know to be ineffectual	2035.8446983444833
679. passage	of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect	a transition	1904.8608278216022
680. he could tell the legislature they had provided the	needed funds to carry on the battle	1266.4793325913824
681. then he could tell them to	go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with	the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in	over an eight months period	5673.538810374275
682. it is difficult to be certain how	the administration views that $28 million since the views of one leader	may not be the same as the views of another one	3216.9785198918303
683. but if	the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a	grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek	a way to use the money for other purposes	5641.026530651831
684. this would be in	perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration-	the shortage of cash	1410.4849032231082
685. it could become an acute problem in the coming	fiscal year	754.0399170853758
686. if the administration does not succeed in passing	the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be	faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting	dilemma	3847.949835937516
687. since the constitution forbids introduction	of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have	to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues	4673.144666087863
688. in either case it could call a special session	of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising	additional revenues through a tax raiser	2843.3938785651585
689. the prospect of cutting	back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor	1189.4649697871587
690. it is one	that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach	to the problem	1883.568831004029
691. but if all alternatives should be clearly	blocked	off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps	to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature	4839.779852398287
692. this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by	the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more	receptive to a tax proposal later in the year	3752.5724026901335
693. a constant problem	confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge	by his foes that he has not tried to economize	3870.410612697083
694. any tax bill	also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using	their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves	2184.413039546121
695. the new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or	token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to	combat some of these criticisms	3905.472918734345
696. city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the	bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage	of a private contracting company which had an inside track	with the city	3569.8299793516285

717. the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass	which listed the same officers as hughes was $600 per joint	3052.8938018813137

1226. it was a nice round figure that 12 he said as	he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed	2822.4273201885453
1227. from the	standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening	exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways	during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open	3932.8246267804448
1228. the idol of	the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a 19 in the united	states open	2599.4572870963484

1235. nor were there any rules	to save him	165.96411755681294

1242. i knew it all along confessed	arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much	nicer it would be to drop one way up there	4463.089629079809
1243. for a serious young	man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an	inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves	from jangling like banjo strings	3665.9926126438068
1244. yet he remains the fiercest of competitors	141.06034049953115

2284. probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment	community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was	sold to the public during the past week	4647.375437336074
2285. for many reasons the	demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous	936.3688208941761
2286. it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the	stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers	and explaining to others why they had no more to sell	6175.780730530039
2287. investors	who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers	who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100	and counted themselves lucky to get that many	3833.8479218344205
2288. in fact very	few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100	shares	2104.5323873667685
2289. some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of	their customers	786.223044661027
2290. a measure of how hot the stock was can be	found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began	3683.0760990924437
2291. the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12	640.9600737805321
2292. the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler	guerin + turner the managing underwriter was at $17 a share	1465.0556716456454
2293. and	from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday	morning at around $22 a share	1877.3269386811476
2294. but the morton foods issue	was hot long before it was on the market	1403.5757183165356
2295. indeed from the moment the	reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last	january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up	2859.7001837154667
2296. letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the	nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would	be sold		3206.9769201772533
2297. there was even	a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned	about the dallas stock offering	2051.5112495031617
2298. we subscribe 500 shares of morton	foods of texas	388.07714077462884

2300. but	egt could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares	965.2806359568328
2301. after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group	members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone	2310.314686203551
2302. but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin	believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all	over the nation	3684.020889066931
2303. i feel confident the stock will qualify for	the 'national list' he said meaning its market price would	be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country	2860.4354103554806
2304. he was	also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved	again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a	job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do	6221.019649417196
2305. but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one	642.6184925373293
2306. the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances	557.5461539010071
2307. first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last	few months driving stocks of all kinds up	1868.0795709059962
2308. as a result it is not	easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced	10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64c		3991.4315476371034
2309. second the potato chip industry	has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods	came along there were only two potato chip stocks- frito and h	w lay- on the market	3567.9964756034583
2310. both of those have had dynamic run-ups	in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher	price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market	at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock	to have a fast run-up	7092.728373616589
2311. and third the potato chip industry has	taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of	late	2040.3100532440253
2312. foods which long had been considered recession resistant	but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going	to higher price-earnings ratios	3475.484445082749
2313. the potato chip industry these	days is growing not only as a	result of population increase and public	acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination	of circumstances	that has led to growth by merger	3948.2542217275745
2314. the history of the	us potato chip industry is that many of today's successful	companies got started during the deep depression days	3263.015326386017
2315. those that remain	are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities	to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest	2849.0687599394373
2316. but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and	suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their	closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management	in their firms	5771.748709406134
2317. so they go looking for mergers with other	firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on	the doors of firms like frito	2735.799864491376
2318. all those things combined to	make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is	2350.602577615476
2319. now if morton's newest product a corn chip known as chip-o's	turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out	to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up	to	4367.378104559246
2320. dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and	distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the	millions of dollars	3911.481607616929

2730. the	logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a	fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody	knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself	4305.277560828702
2731. the	solution naturally is the bus	65.8957029658436

3052. the heightened tension in fact had been	a major factor in the president's change of view about the urgency	of a meeting with the soviet leader	2738.155078042723
3053. he was not going to vienna	to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow	last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned	3687.843167252282
3054. but	mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with	mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe	2035.5406547961418
3055. that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting	961.5633876271371
3056. despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance	of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters	of the cold war	3093.6671414042285
3057. the u s and	soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston	churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy	with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the	summit of the nations	6693.434489944455
3058. the first time was in 1955 when a	full-dress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva	1565.8727074930734
3059. the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads	into the middle east	1895.1919883270803
3060. in 1959 president eisenhower	and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s	1097.178246352994
3061. that meeting produced the spirit of camp david- a spirit it	later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress	toward a berlin settlement	3908.2077855411308
3062. on the third occasion- another	big four summit session at paris a year ago- there was no problem	of an illusory spirit	2184.576642247726
3063. premier khrushchev wrecked the conference	at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s	for the u-2 incident	3056.6081656373035
3064. the episode tended to confirm the u	s belief that propaganda the hope of one-sided concessions and	the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were	the soviet leader's real aims in summitry	3756.4281559151946
3065. thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration	that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr	kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem	4302.246436924272
3066. shortly before his	nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations	with the soviet leader in these words:   as long	as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is	shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp	david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful	negotiations	5600.68847803974
3067. the president had set for himself the task which	he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to	the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance	4990.3429074691185
3068. he did	not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make	it unnecessary	1404.8646754268643
3069. he wanted time too to review the united states'	global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited	and new ones he was formulating	4103.917461977646
3070. above all he did not want to appear	to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev's doorstep	1558.2332868214148
3071. flexible	at the same time the president took pains not to	rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader	2811.993200567112
3072. ideally he knew	it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels	783.6217349230005
3073. but mr	kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue	hopes were not raised in connection with it	3022.2145882191007
3074. it would give him an	opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war	to try to probe mr khrushchev's intentions and to make clear	his own views	3430.9836657975275
3075. moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no	other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not	inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions	5157.898866028184
3076. both elements- the caution about a meeting the willingness	eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the president	which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia	late in february	3563.75765010383
3077. the letter dated feb 22 was delivered to	premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march 9	1876.2322052523655
3078. it dealt	mainly with a broad range of east-west issues	373.4612453485198
3079. but it also briefly	suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before	the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and	schedules permitted	4472.167770799735
3080. developments over the next two months however	caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing	1408.4530718603467
3081. there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house	about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international	climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating	alarmingly	5317.3626482216205
3082. the president was especially	concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at	geneva	1262.7335063333994
3083. the deadlock has been caused by the russians' new demand	for a three-man directorate and thus a veto	over the control machinery	3274.2809718756894
3084. in the u s strong pressures	have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians	may be secretly testing	2453.909106762709
3085. mr kennedy was less troubled	by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown	or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear	weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament	6564.609372181958
3086. there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was	also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly	to communist china	2175.374725173539
3087. the question arose as to whether a frank discussion	of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent	2834.7329711635134
3088. moreover	moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle	to the executive organs of all international bodies including	the u n secretariat and the international control commission	for laos	3213.0413515904106
3089. mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand	would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible	2137.688066209831
3090. developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability	of an early summit meeting	942.8207293054405
3091. initially the white house reaction	was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict	in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting	3913.1444617174857
3092. at the same time	there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader	as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion	about the west's ability and determination to resist communist	pressure	4036.236685149379
3093. in cuba the u s had blundered badly and	created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even	on its own doorstep	3278.612885009289
3094. in laos the picture was almost equally bad	165.69887203903744
3095. u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier	khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized	on soviet terms	3675.9940968680503
3096. beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention	in laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed	moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic	moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces	3855.40661699451
3097. as a result	the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva	negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast	asia are under increased pressure	5010.40338739079
3098. in the light of those	events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev	might overreach himself	1718.3878531346277
3099. ambassador thompson reported from moscow	that the soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive	1412.4389327363592
3100. he has indicated	that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out	1100.000242020416
3101. the	president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn	premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such	as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning	back	5923.436928525634
3102. it was in the midst of such white house deliberations	that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the	u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in	the near future	3846.032253037278
3103. mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer	by may 20 after consultation with the allies	2128.283431859509
3104. the response from	london paris and bonn was favorable	261.25692334890624
3105. firm arrangements for the meeting	in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and	washington last week	2808.668467904353
3106. apparently at the insistence of the u s	the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow	last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting	2612.9811030862597
3107. the	washington announcement said:    the president and chairman	khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose	of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems	that involve the interest of many other countries	5780.171758836721
3108. the meeting	will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first	personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the	major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries	3767.585345156357
3109. the vienna meeting will bring together a	seasoned	67-year-old veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedy's	own words is shrewd tough vigorous well-informed and confident	and a 44-year-old president with a	demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international	diplomacy	6828.075867101812
3110. the announcement last week of the forthcoming	encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval	and disapproval	1878.5853356378798
3111. the approval did not arise from an expectation	of far-reaching agreements at vienna	1181.984887189746
3112. the inclination was to accept	the statement that there would be no formal negotiations	944.0910057197731
3113. but those	who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between	the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary	4654.79122117076
3114. mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about	his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men	2025.5984003465862
3115. the feeling was	that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the	president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause	4505.118058360629
3116. apart from the personal equation another reason advanced	in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us	appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit	3318.864336958938
3117. premier khrushchev	has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got	his summit meeting anyway	2588.1598833040916
3118. this time the initiative came in part	at least from washington	502.1183600656107
3119. there was also	the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president	will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied	leaders	4102.958124235614
3120. thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader	of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity	2167.8037481160054
3121. finally	there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president's	making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test	accord	4299.469175406304
3122. there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings	throughout the world	792.3441588945187
3123. if tests are to be resumed the argument went	it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to	the soviet union	4085.963417041633
3124. disapproval of the meeting was based largely	on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse	1414.4818032882217
3125. after cuba	and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the president's	consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness-	perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage	he now believes he holds	6323.394003055829
3126. moreover the president is meeting the	soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided	on the scope of america's firm foreign policy commitments	2856.599662859047
3127. the	question was raised for example as to what attitude the president	would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending	from southeast asia to the middle east	4856.943179668853
3128. there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of	adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory	2040.4573837317457
3129. mollusks are a case in point	64.46573375491329
3130. the shell which served the strain	so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended	to cancel out the possibility of future development	2719.85043948996
3131. though this may	or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and	the weakness of american catholic higher education	3473.9665419895964
3132. there can	be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field	of higher education is most impressive: our european brethren never	cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities	3944.6449763718256
3133. the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades	rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that	3025.567328507185
3134. by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement	stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which	brought the parochial school system into existence	3218.051498584497
3135. there	is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture	960.7193814900705
3136. viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect	we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school	to university	2328.9865652173003
3137. but the simple truth is that higher education has	never really been an official american catholic project; certainly	not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school	system has been a matter of official policy	6057.887732995174
3138. official encouragement	is one thing but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan	and parochial funds	1421.7694913138428
3139. american catholics have responded generously	to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to	create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar	fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning	5630.780506782151
3140. they	have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly	ever been made	1409.4644318606672
3141. diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this	as their direct responsibility	753.0496172410902
3142. all of this may be understandable	enough: it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan	authorities could have acted otherwise	2161.585185316123
3143. yet for better or for worse	the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do	not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to	the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious	communities	6061.653673490583
3144. community esprit de corps has been the protective	shell which has made the achievement possible	1108.324973136256
3145. to understand	the past history- and the future potential- of american catholic	higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character	of the esprit d' corps of the religious community	4997.983633364417
3146. it is something	more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and	detachment	1100.6856753603088
3147. a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves	a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found	elsewhere	3057.8565676945777
3148. the fact that the group orientation and group identification	are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs	of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension	3235.6100261519177
3149. the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship	the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting	edge of sacrifice and hardship	4085.149080191647
3150. american catholic colleges	and universities are in a very real sense the product of private	enterprise- the private enterprise of religious communities	2194.3223810489253
3151. had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities	might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized	by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious	as paid employees	5325.700940379744
3152. there is however no point in speculating about such	a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of	higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which	produces the family business	3938.190832181608
3153. this family-community spirit	is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement	1186.4750108325106
3154. it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american	catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication	apparent in some areas	2458.4255692966044
3155. i think for example of three women's colleges	with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of	a major catholic university which is also co-educational	4095.8297382233313
3156. this is not	an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented	upon often enough	1565.882355475906
3157. it would seem to represent esprit de corps	run riot	557.5753152335873
3158. apart however from the question of wasteful duplication	there is another aspect of the family business spirit	in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny	2716.139536009567
3159. for while the past needs of the church in this country may have	been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone	closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would	seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles	the university in its pursuit of excellence	7617.306795344625
3160. at the earlier	pre-academic excellence stage of catholic education the operation	could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis	1729.3385650212117
3161. but with today's	demand for professional qualifications and specialized training	the need for outsiders become more pressing	2133.845119516485
3162. the problem	is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but	that a different brand is called for	1720.9107393604831
3163. commenting on the earlier stage	the notre dame chapter of the american association of university	professors	noted that the term teacher-employee	was	a not inapt description	4095.197876915719
3164. today however the outsider is likely	to have professional qualifications of the highest order	and to be acclimatized	to the democratic processes of the secular or state university	2983.882419396751
3165. and	while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar	will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second	class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank	or professional achievement	6201.960876027978
3166. it is natural that he should	turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization	which actually owns the university and whose goals are in	their opinion identified with its highest good and	'the attainment of excellence'	6584.200959132179
3167. the pattern	here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame: it is simply	that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution	by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious	where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty	4668.705012385822
3168. it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report	should refer to the organization which actually owns the university:	this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more	to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension	6669.123587606688
3169. but	in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines	to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy	one	2987.208945116899
3170. outside faculty members want to be considered partners in	the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business	3046.9266370006417
3171. there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with	this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university	2310.1673271755735
3172. in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber	personnel	1405.784401760577
3173. word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession	much given to attending meetings and conferences	1256.88191814322
3174. expressions	of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member	has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype	2835.6657064831743
3175. in	the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or	a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines	to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions	at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere	5037.942505757552
3176. to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized	that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security	that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does	in an elementary school system or in the civil service	6928.715991868872
3177. much has	been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee	firm tenure	1095.0566074145993
3178. this is a significant advance but its import should not	be exaggerated	954.9196815532911
3179. when a man invests a block of his years at a university	without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the	problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in	the market value of his services	4402.000125579063
3180. a man does not make that kind of	gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure	positions is being reserved for members of the family	4998.911124956788
3181. just	as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new	tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance	of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions	3649.883732345893
3182. yet adequate compensation-	and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute	for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his	earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place	5477.9762349233715
3183. broadly	speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible	but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature	responsibility in the total work of the university	3345.1404567974
3184. religious who	derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious	community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate	both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this	identification	5630.450159861351
3185. there is no need here to spell out the conditions	of creative teaching except to point out that at the college	level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even	more necessary than it is at other levels	4204.7011984460205
3186. the college teacher needs	the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also	needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the	luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution	6066.241602697924
3187. but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from	the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation	2452.985630614626
3188. the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy	between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and	operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is	therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself	6683.618814172631
3189. this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary	and tenure	787.5370392652042
3190. yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive	resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless	certain suggestions which seem to be in order	4625.797544566036
3191. the first	is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty	committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real	authority	2732.216994969692
3192. in the case of academic personnel the feeling of	participation can hardly be faked	1410.7348394618537
3193. competent teachers are well	versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without	destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own	decisions	2723.7250413412107
3194. those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar	with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to	be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making	4661.483083204112
3195. in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of	participation are what is called for at all	2165.3775112421217
3196. in the notre dame report	reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced	to luncheon-table communication	2588.030641628707
3197. in itself there is nothing wrong	with this form of participation: the only difficulty on the	catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position	to implement policy ie members of the religious community which	owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements	4822.0176168670105
3198. sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david	martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions	under the anti-monopoly laws	3876.9342947867626
3199. once more the fallacious equation is advanced	to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly	laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions:	the law must treat everybody equally	3536.674688027747
3200. or in the words of anatole	france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich	as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under	bridges	4997.934823105264
3201. the public atmosphere that has been generated which	makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute	into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellan's	hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and later	into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations	at the missile sites	5099.823563613833
3202. the senator was shocked by stoppages over	allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program	1635.9188342459356
3203. in addition	disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess	of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation	on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill	3636.6414783378655
3204. it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but	he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes	to fight a strike	4495.153254851476
3205. business week reports that	the united aircraft company against which the international association	of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants	operating	2607.0439146912545
3206. the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable	to four factors: advertising to attract new employees hiring	and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by	the new workers	5011.719926340539
3207. the company has billed the united states government	for $7500000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation	allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and	necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business	3862.525445217995
3208. rep	frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the	attention of the armed services committee	2120.8030977558437
3209. neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan	been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor	abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions	2977.558584931582
3210. the	recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution	of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers	has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified	neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained	6470.103400295892
3211. the	anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely	undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is	a winner	2856.4454198078506
3212. the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully	cannot follow the law	1636.193621724725
3213. hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a	foolish public policy	374.9054129414895
3214. let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods	industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of	other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy	to rig prices and allocate the market	5331.661047684669
3215. the industry is so structured	that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way	overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing	is applied	2871.133466959121
3216. the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise	is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods	in addition to the heavy electrical equipment	4479.5016057459825
3217. accounting procedures	can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price	787.4178192455875
3218. naturally	enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to	structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors	can be forced to the wall in a very short time	5780.001066666412
3219. should these giants	really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only	survivors in the industry	1416.489033240423
3220. uncle sam would then accuse them of creating	a monopoly by unfair competition	1182.578143193206
3221. but if they show self-restraint	they don't get the orders	375.39423191110996
3222. under the circumstances	the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage	in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter	were convicted	4646.227813814219
3223. engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy	by the giants	791.8601369259283
3224. the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by	the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric	sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices	so low as to compete seriously with its fellows	6458.667564552927
3225. in other words	the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday	wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer	on tuesday thursday and saturday	3349.373830933599
3226. and which theory would	govern the enforcers of the law on sunday	960.9488235491415
3227. the question	might be asked: don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods	manufacturers know these facts	1101.599573462276
3228. why did they engage in a	flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise	to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in	the laws	4996.020405260628
3229. the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to	management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism	back in 1937	2170.369502220046
3230. he wrote:  h the anti-trust	laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need	of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place	in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure	6429.2057963742345
3231. h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled	business dictatorship	504.2316972508417
3232. h when corporate abuses were attacked	it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked	rather than control	3022.05011540167
3233. h in this manner every scheme for direct	control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust	laws	2035.398794607032
3234. h in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust	laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial	empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most	fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation	is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control	by the government	8261.20176495318
3235. this escape from control has led to management's	evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as	worth while	1568.5604319522663
3236. a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine	after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license	3274.4903536847823
3237. penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail	sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions perhaps because	the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing	if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control	of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must	be devised for representing the public interest	5145.062716852155
3238. a secret conspiracy	of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle	560.6791835133121
3239. however one can argue that	no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust	laws are effective and rational	2333.4698950834068
3240. quite clearly the anti-trust laws	are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that	they should be extended to the labor union	3689.650192092042
3241. those who	favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating	a brand new reform	1572.5871303071197
3242. before 1933 individuals who opposed	trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english	1635.5553362822834
3243. the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934	implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial	recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining	in principle	3640.8399631934526
3244. the wagner act the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin	act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining	2130.538158161842
3245. the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system	is the removal of wages from competition	1103.9321172049345
3246. if a union cannot perform	this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers	as a gigantic fraud	2817.8580370294508
3247. the tortured reasoning that unions	use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply	and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession	3333.0513147516003
3248. the problem must be faced squarely	65.24606250390009
3249. if laborers are merely commodities	competing against each other in a market place like so many bags	of wheat and corn	then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism	to a system that imposes such status upon them	4222.373164068233
3250. human labor	was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century	america	965.4933745402756
3251. as early as 1776 adam smith wrote in the wealth of	nations: we have no acts of parliament against combining	to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it	3543.384904760598
3252. eighteenth-century england upon whose customs our common law was	built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies	2122.1642070264766
3253. in 1825	the boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced	by the organized employers who declared: it is h considered	that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to h effect	the value of labor h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies	4810.727169650737
3254. there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for	collective bargaining but against labor monopoly	1644.3139898514764
3255. the courts	shared the opinion of the employers	167.9532006159215
3256. compare this statement	of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin according	to the daily labor report of sept 19 1961 defends	the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor	if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or	prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his	employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment	5864.592740888273
3257. senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust	measures to unions in transportation	1167.9209945373764
3258. his bill allegedly aimed at	hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norris-laguardia acts	to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation	strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert	with any other union- even a sister local in the same international	4896.2281903067105
3259. paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was	attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation	the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they	met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action	would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act	7701.919606442214
3260. indeed it	is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently	granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example	the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the	encouragement of railroads to seek mergers	4128.302537330606
3261. at the very moment that	every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality	of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective	bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions	who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that	ship operators set freight rates	8166.391901830068
3262. the passage of the	sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies	503.02656999865076
3263. it was most effective against	trade unions	140.06301349158687
3264. in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was	brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices	eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product	of the struck manufacturer	3664.3981103497113
3265. the suit against the union was successful	and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment	2359.703504475331
3266. in 1914 the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under	the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be	considered a commodity	2842.6558294209153
3267. the law could not suspend economics	64.98106142242459
3268. labor remained	a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization	from the anti-trust laws	1108.2163008345
3269. the courts by interpretation	emasculated the act	141.77908691145558
3270. in 1922 the united mine workers struck the	coronado coal company	504.2297267491679
3271. the company sued under the anti-trust laws	alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of	interstate commerce	2574.7152666817174
3272. the	court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference	with commerce	944.1631012590778
3273. at a closed-door session	on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made	his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on	us affairs abroad	4463.785488975881
3274. afterward tennessee's democratic senator	albert gore summed it up for newsmen	502.14350258718093
3275. what herter presented	said gore was not a very encouraging review	758.4171610987183
3276. that was something	of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between	the west and communism erupted on three fronts	2181.6252405464757
3277. president eisenhower held an 8:30 am meeting with	top military and foreign-policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic	relations immediately	1888.6110071246453
3278. there is a limit to what the united	states in self-respect can endure said the president	1878.5988214567988
3279. that limit	has now been reached	43.34146114814191
3280. through secretary herter ike	offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new	administration with the breakoff decision	2369.4655115291525
3281. kennedy through secretary-designate	of state dean rusk declined	167.6995351899472
3282. he thus kept his hands	free for any action after jan 20 although reaction to the break	was generally favorable in the us and latin america	after a white house huddle	between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted	sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that	several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north	viet nam	8555.514905752138
3283. in view of the present situation in laos said the	pentagon's announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions	to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific	2990.3767702340724
3284. cutting	short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington	and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied	by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines	5022.264612877769
3285. on the us's island base of okinawa task force 116 made	up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move	southward on signal	2870.0024156818517
3286. but by week's end the laotian cry of	invasion was read as an exaggeration and	the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies	that a neutralist- rather than a pro-western- government might	be best for laos	6182.061002988325
3287. there was a moral of	sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war	fronts	1560.7493928757128
3288. political economic and military experts were all agreed that	chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world	to fight a war- and they were probably right	4626.968054019335
3289. it would be like fighting	the french and indian war all over again said one military	man	1421.0380304591374
3290. but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground	392.8652707620122
3291. at geneva in 1954 to get the war in indo-china settled the	british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands	and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet	nam- which then predictably became a base for communist operations	against neighboring south viet nam and laos	5082.039995650024
3292. the late secretary	of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement	a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to	keep it from becoming a calamity for the west	5323.8904821257
3293. he began the diplomatic	discussions that resulted in the establishment of seato	640.7235041750814
3294. the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the	past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern	viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout	southeast asia	6078.618715984454
3295. russian tanks and artillery parading through	the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian	arms drops in laos	made it plain once more	that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time	4119.889713880304
3296. soviet premier	khrushchev sent new year's hopes for peace to president-elect	kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply	2602.2124284712268
3297. considering the	state of the whole world the cold war's three exposed fronts did	not seem terribly ominous; but in senator gore's words it was	not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f	kennedy on inauguration day	4129.478377279603
3298. _turmoil in the	house liberal	democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled	by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal	legislation to the floor	5477.721786862115
3299. the liberal pressure bloc	had fought the	committee before and had always lost	791.1110073211652
3300. this time they were much better	prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable	1641.4256236877075
3301. they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy whose own	legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck	1742.3507882664373
3302. and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will	1181.025949556994
3303. there were two possible methods of breaching	to pack	it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock	to remove one of the conservatives- namely mississippi's	14-term william meyers colmer	3222.1937535945094
3304. caucusing the	liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic	course since seniority in the house is next to godliness	3689.257434233251
3305. a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than	his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist	position	to that of a diehard conservative	3109.149831912209
3306. he is generally and initially	suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his	gulf coast constituents	2576.65485167558
3307. he is of course a segregationist but	he says he has never made an anti-negro speech	1265.3708359281413
3308. for 20 years he	has enjoyed his power on the rules committee	961.3040357255337
3309. there his vote along	with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge	and the four republican members could and often did produce a 6-6	deadlock that blocked far-out	democratic-sponsored welfare legislation		2674.042443612753
3310. there was	sufficient pretext to demand colmer's ouster: he had given his	lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi	2842.1006003136176
3311. reprisals	are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has	been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons	2177.6498237277224
3312. in 1949 the dixiecrats	escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry	truman and in 1957	after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned	for dwight eisenhower in 1956 his fellow democrats did not touch	his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily	of his patronage	6895.995894051111
3313. judge	smith threatened reprisal against powell	43.434856176893874
3314. said he: we will	but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with	president-elect kennedy decided that this year something had to be	done about the rules committee- and that he was the only man who could	do anything effective	6467.808248544801
3315. in a tense closed-door session with	judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add	three new members to the rules committee		1689.7153609683276
3316. smith flatly rejected the offer	and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels	1411.726795056724
3317. the next	morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and	broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he	is said to regard as an inferior man	3873.7421995074646
3318. news of	rayburn's	commitment soon leaked out	139.01928011550837
3319. when missouri's clarence cannon got	the word he turned purple	378.5586550329242
3320. unconscionable! he shouted and	rushed off to the speaker's room to object: a dangerous precedent!	cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support	to the smith-colmer forces: as chairman of the appropriations	committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding	this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects	7640.886913991324
3321. sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge	smith ally georgia's carl vinson chairman of the armed services	committee	2175.275007677322
3322. as the battle raged in the cloakrooms	and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose	2121.2852528969242
3323. his	highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice	that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus	1874.8103772202635
3324. the liberals	smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three	big votes- in the democratic committee on committees in the full	party caucus and on the floor of the house- before they could oust	colmer	5892.6128924276845
3325. the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported	in all three arenas they seemed certain	of victory- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash	2843.237371633489
3326. but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter	of losing a costlier war	1874.311233965201
3327. if the southerners were sufficiently aroused	they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons	from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam	rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party	3439.261997963063
3328. with that possibility	in mind arkansas' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a	meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought	to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort	of face-saving compromise	5934.46300226436
3329. here are two old men mad at each other	and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader	2184.25866390427
3330. one wants a little more power and the other doesn't want	to give up any	1641.5543042424774
3331. the senate launched the	87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative	battle but in contrast with the house's guerrilla war it seemed	as pro forma as a capitol guide's speech	3571.2718510488203
3332. question at issue:	how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate- and	thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters	2823.1308780714157
3333. a wide-ranging	bipartisan force- from minnesota's democratic hubert humphrey	to massachusetts' republican leverett saltonstall- was	drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally	used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills	3767.214441698003
3334. new mexico's	clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate's	notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and	voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds	5326.624630949908
3335. fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a	mere majority of senators	1102.3882650948472
3336. georgia's dick russell objected politely	and the battle was joined	564.9222394770638
3337. privately the liberals admitted	that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage	786.1959388395911
3338. privately	they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson's three-fifths	modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon	2809.1512124633728
3339. in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of	senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each	new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were	not binding	4029.9134919224866
3340. armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals	rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate	on the filibuster battle this week	3921.8034839838824
3341. hopefully the perennial battle	of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all	1571.02795600954
3342. since election day vice president	richard nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public	view	2134.6949998361856
3343. but with the convening of the new congress he was the public	man again presiding over the senate until john kennedy's inauguration	2179.663159935888
3344. one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore	that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to	hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to	make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated	him in the tight 1960 presidential election	7597.759701135406
3345. nixon fulfilled his	assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration	786.9986387298992
3346. this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate	for the presidency announced the result of an election in which	he was defeated he said	4269.640269057957
3347. the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do	to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves	1732.9133631531654
3348. gary player the small	trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his 25	years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the	victory to drop in his lap	5645.17005612068
3349. arnold palmer the defending champion lost	his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that	left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief	2860.114997064112
3350. just when you	think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you	player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament	4102.513435107023
3351. and	that is just what happened on the last few holes	501.5568348199698
3352. the augusta national	golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer	1416.5806049325815
3353. player was the first to feel its teeth	167.6218888755663
3354. after playing a splendid first	nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final	day of the tournament	player's	game rapidly fell to pieces	4466.483726922646
3355. after a journey through	woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th	504.42200424600304
3356. he bogeyed the 15th	by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three	holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total	of 280	4847.581450501984
3357. as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course	player was almost in tears	1098.4610460532087
3358. he could read on the nearby scoreboard	that palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke	3040.1884684153592
3359. palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at	one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes	2464.415999007559
3360. now	all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the	biggest single paycheck in golf	3264.2776786434274
3361. when palmer hit a good straight	drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship	won	2043.9133063135523
3362. but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green	strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression	2840.334265107926
3363. in trying to	hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green	past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower	2869.784213036114
3364. afterwards	palmer told charlie coe his last-round partner that he	simply played the hole too fast	1880.596581559163
3365. he did seem hasty on his second and	third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while	coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his	composure	which he had quite visibly lost	4109.687697296608
3366. when the shaken palmer	finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet	2117.236710290255
3367. palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting	beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman	clifford roberts' clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when	palmer missed the putt	3935.9349878293892
3368. palmer's 281 for the four rounds	at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest	pro but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe	4969.123626465261
3369. the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch	tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters	overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69	3557.992491056741
3370. at seven	until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played	seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters- four last year	and three this- without ever being out of first place	4970.110783167614
3371. as evening	approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing	one-over-par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to	his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69	3327.8919598013126
3372. his three-round total	of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by bill	collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing	very well all winter long	5287.52286130575
3373. but palmer knew as did everybody	else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken	1402.3165822239182
3374. half an hour	after he finished his round player holed out at the 18th green with	a 69 and a three-round total of 206 four strokes ahead of palmer	4635.33948585133
3375. more than a streak had ended	43.48768226764459
3376. long after the erratic climate	and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological	footnotes the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the	mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player	5804.1326131944
3377. unlike most	such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously	although this was not exactly the case	1715.869798984734
3378. when the winter	tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to	challenge palmer's towering prestige	3029.868918580546
3379. as if to confirm his stature	he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments	1092.5618460283254
3380. but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was	leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the	rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere	5159.807949411492
3381. on the final round at	pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same	threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery	was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of	the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come	5298.966678415351
3382. on	that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading	the tournament and as it turned out neither won it	3256.123591343262
3383. but whichever	of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial	leader of the tour	1736.4321527755656
3384. player immediately proved he was not in the	least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer	1880.48455245588
3385. he outplayed palmer	all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer's	71	1260.6282476416031
3386. thereafter until the masters player gradually increased	his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory	at miami	3055.951229696154
3387. when they reached augusta last week together they had	won five of the 13 tournaments to date	1407.0909365634404
3388. on thursday	the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and	player developed instantly	1884.4788610283013
3389. it was a dismal drizzly day but a good	one on which to score over the augusta national course	1728.3417929300467
3390. the usually	skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike	their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward	the hole without too much worry about the consequences	5653.202913253846
3391. palmer's 4-under-par	68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg	1255.4503758047563
3392. but player was only one stroke back with a 69	567.1443821857367
3393. even	so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators-	unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament	was to be essentially a match between palmer and player	3644.536258813976
3394. on	friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and	ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus	2478.9197269764218
3395. rosburg	had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were	on the course- separated as they were destined to be for the rest	of the weekend	by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous	scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a	73 was not having a good day	8261.900287353812
3396. as player began his second round	in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery	was not conspicuously large for a contender	2585.3047778852297
3397. player began with a birdie	on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie	at the 9th	2822.3083631628165
3398. on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of	a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament	2328.1402326414254
3399. he birdied	the 13th the 15th and the 18th- five birdies one bogey and 12 pars	for a 68	2602.0038799699223
3400. starting half an hour behind player in company with	british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the 2nd the	9th the 13th and the 16th- four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for	a 69	3765.8484414062887
3401. the roar of palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would	roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered	moments later by the roar of player's gallery for a similar triumph	5779.362014421793
3402. at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a 25-foot	putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th	green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole	3948.500430202404
3403. without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed	palmer proceeded to sink	his 25-footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling	back along the intervening fairways in reply	5789.77490078381
3404. anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way	had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing	this most difficult golf course	2858.686122489372
3405. it is almost axiomatic that golfers	who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots	with a vehemence bordering on violence	4066.447041574121
3406. the bad luck that can so often	mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated	by the contemptuous boldness of these champions	2616.1063045552683
3407. bob jones played	that way	22.041443811640406
3408. byron nelson did hogan did	14.674366817319315
3409. and last week at the masters	palmer and player did	557.8872536440791
3410. as the third round of the tournament	began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was player's	superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead	2980.3055064239484
3411. this	day palmer had started first	65.42393727253366
3412. as player stepped on the first tee	he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was	2 under par for the day	2726.8942812883215
3413. player immediately proceeded to follow suit	64.69351495561052
3414. in fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under	par for the first eight holes	2329.719365342475
3415. but player's real test came	on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards	2363.5584078480138
3416. he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating	the 9th and first fairways	1736.7420676764214
3417. having hit one of the trees the ball came	to rest not more than 160 yards out	2113.7895922093167
3418. player then had the choice of	punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling	for a bogey 5 or gambling	2721.4168802944982
3419. the latter involved hitting a full	four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to	slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green	4294.609294432806
3420. i was hitting	the ball well player said later and i felt strong	781.1042608556894
3421. when	you're playing like that you'd better attack	249.2566187724391
3422. player attacked	with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever	forget	1407.9191708747833
3423. it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the	edge	1420.0842765389848
3424. from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4	792.3349191574266
3425. palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles	140.17281421752688
3426. they started on	the 4th hole a 220-yard par-3	264.52502160118956
3427. on this day the wind had switched 180`	from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the	course was different from the previous few days	4503.090243269033
3428. at the 4th tee palmer	chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club so	he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green	3229.205261302365
3429. his bogey 4 on this	hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought	him back to even par	3907.74578821414
3430. starting the second nine palmer was	already four strokes behind player and knew it	930.1050373671973
3431. when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees' man	of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches	upon the sublime	4101.041764822289
3432. when roger eugene maris mantle's muscular	teammate powers four home runs in a double-header his performance	merits awe	1572.5902819078262
3433. but when tiny 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the	los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center	field because as a teammate explained the other team thought	no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months	his achievement borders	on the ridiculous	7336.88997271568
3434. this is the year home runs	ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous	796.7651900310354
3435. pitchers	grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike	zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal	2197.461867013348
3436. experts	point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused	by expansion	1641.266641739506
3437. whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season	produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records	home-run division	2317.8569684139425
3438. of all the records in peril one stands	apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now	doubly dramatic in its jeopardy	3708.1351901369403
3439. this of course is baseball's most	remarkable mark: the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible	epicure the incredible athlete george herman ruth of the	yankees	2990.501133249081
3440. since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious	runs at babe ruth's record and each in turn has been thwarted	3277.611485801053
3441. what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth's amazing september	surge	376.04039331867284
3442. in the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen	home runs a closing spurt never matched	2363.5206823470658
3443. always	in the abortive attacks upon ruth's record one man alone- a	jimmy foxx or a hack	wilson- made the bid	2052.214844219496
3444. but now for the first time	since lou gehrig spurred ruth on in 1927 two men	playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60	4094.598615245838
3445. their names are mantle	and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real	1262.372134336731
3446. after 108 games in 1927 ruth had 35 home runs	564.7549190031503
3447. after 108	games in 1961 mickey mantle has 43 roger maris 41	638.6641044789098
3448. extend mantle's	and maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162	games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs	3677.4228984639813
3449. this	is the	great edge the two yankees have going for them	642.2761408556319
3450. to better ruth's	mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish	564.615283123213
3451. all mantle	needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september	and he will establish a new record	2044.6427841704772
3452. in ruth's day- and until this	year- the schedule was 154 games	955.8537992040003
3453. baseball commissioner ford frick	has ruled that ruth's record will remain official unless it is	even on the basis of 154 games this	is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now vice-president	of the chicago white sox	3953.6843501067865
3454. it has to be easier with two of them	390.36744472159734
3455. how can you walk maris to get to mantle	259.78929193518115
3456. neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict 60 home runs	for himself	966.6762688507255
3457. although both concede they would like to hit 60 they	stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: the	important thing is to win the pennant	2724.874497573078
3458. but one thing is for certain:	there is no dissension between mantle the american league's	most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the mvp	in 1960	4487.372775968556
3459. each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs	and each enjoys even more seeing himself	hit home runs	1573.1276359330882
3460. the sluggers get	along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer	they are rooming	together	3029.6039971966293
3461. mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share	an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york	international airport	2174.6906928940675
3462. the three pay $251 a month for four rooms	with air-conditioning	and new modern furniture	1651.9587387061692
3463. mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom;	maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room	2041.1805745906017
3464. they	divide up the household chores: cerv does most of the cooking	mantle supplies the	transportation and maris drives	the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium	4674.1290019363105
3465. mantle maris and cerv probably share one major-league record already:	among them they have fifteen children- eight for cerv four	for mantle and three for maris	2725.3773665446606
3466. as roommates teammates	and home-run mates mantle 29 who broke in with the yankees ten years	ago and maris 26 who came to the yankees from kansas city	two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds	5650.486211936615
3467. both were scholastic	stars in football basketball and baseball	; as halfbacks both came close	to playing football at the university of oklahoma		1007.4519582900514
3468. to an extent the two even look alike	253.3127717293572
3469. both have blue	eyes and short blond hair	168.0136797951871
3470. both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195	and 200 pounds but mantle incredibly muscular	looks bigger	2346.451307146744
3471. with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders	both must have their clothes made to order	1098.3518788864292
3472. maris purchases $100	suits from simpson's in new york	392.4433926197566
3473. mantle more concerned with	dress buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and	pays as much as $250 each	2331.0798756433296
3474. neither mantle nor	maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle	has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry miller's	tropic of cancer	4102.70052271537
3475. mantle so appreciated miller's delicate	literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive	passages aloud during road trips	1889.5059014088624
3476. mantle is not normally	given to public speaking- or for that matter to private speaking	1649.6824103156591
3477. what do you and mickey talk about at home	261.9144294315178
3478. a reporter asked	maris recently	22.460722125695508
3479. to tell you the truth maris said mickey	don't talk much	502.22097583708126
3480. this is no surprising trait for	a ballplayer	251.48660923578555
3481. what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris	under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying	to be cooperative	2181.751892582696
3482. of the two mantle is by nature the less	outgoing maris the more outspoken	1420.9813164489804
3483. but last week when a reporter	was standing near mantle's locker mickey walked up and volunteered	an anecdote	1568.6973126362236

3487. i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low	and the kid walks over to me looks up and says: 'you stunk'	2325.348412728201
3488. maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions	candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen	2802.015748117984
3489. when	i've made a dumb play he says i don't want to talk to	anyone	1093.6167482805272
3490. by his own confession maris is an	angry young man	563.4629211401442
3491. benched at tulsa in 1955 he told manager dutch meyer:	i can't play for you	1095.7259942853864
3492. send me where i can play	65.28034727953975
3493. benched at indianapolis in 1956	he told manager kerby farrell: i'm not learning anything on	the bench	1406.5777215466821
3494. that's the way i am	he says	139.99411388151572
3495. i tell people what i think	43.408953243573556
3496. if you're a good ballplayer	you've got to get mad	559.8249748152707
3497. give me a team of nine angry men and i'll	give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of	ten times	2709.745307291367
3498. one good indication of the two	men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes	2353.3673607878322
3499. when i was a kid maris	told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day	in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not	3458.1827209725443
3500. when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice	1399.5722561721948
3501. are you kidding	0.20041515
3502. said maris	0.30041514999999996
3503. you're	afraid to talk to a guy you idolize	262.9684583522544
3504. mantle's hero was joe	dimaggio	22.272072867142604
3505. when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman	an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio	still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker	just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this	hero of his	4672.787895113235
3506. but dimaggio never said a word	65.65013100880648
3507. he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this	never would be said of him	2319.752457144198
3508. mantle has kept the vow	22.25001512409852
3509. among all	the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies	648.0239663793848
3510. neither	mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else	959.1171048835537
3511. if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $1 an hour	paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would	lay ties on a railroad track	3464.3670429688077
3512. if working in a zinc mine which he once	did for 87-12 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for	the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine	5045.510039850902
3513. but since railroading	and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate	on baseball	1413.0858985551363
3514. they try to play baseball the best they can	393.84506336529915
3515. each is a complete ballplayer	14.812515987448432
3516. mantle beyond any question can	do more things well	394.0083089684155
3517. says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both	hitting	mantle	has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed	maris only left-handed	3132.20534755851
3518. they both possess near classic	stances	dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings	1644.1006029514406
3519. mantle is considerably	better hitting for average		43.212668108033014
3520. both are good bunters: maris	once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; mantle	is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base	4090.331240800488
3521. both have brilliant	speed: mantle was timed from home plate to	first base in 3	1095.7849520442066
3522. 1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer; maris	ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a	race against luis aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the	white sox	5631.908372338494
3523. both are good daring fielders: mantle covers more	ground; maris's throwing arm is stronger	940.0772518880913
3524. yet with all their	skills the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one	basic: the home run	3050.3957092804476
3525. with this ultimate weapon the two yankees	may have saved baseball from its dullest season	1103.1132789048602
3526. only two teams in each league	the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling	for first place	2595.1679954121046
3527. appropriately the emphasis on the home	run at a peak this year came into being at baseball's lowest moment	1730.2410467658265
3528. in 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired	to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned	and disinterested in baseball	4279.855161243996
3529. something was needed to revive interest;	the something was the home run	643.603872407592

3532. frankie was fairly glutted with ideas as	he had hinted upon his arrival: it's really tremendous when you	think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia	3917.255770729612
3533. i could talk to	you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans!	as the plans were laid some several thousand fat cats were to	be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced	at $10000 each	4822.070617267739
3534. the biggest single act would doubtless be staged	by frankie himself: his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by	hollywood couturier don loper who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles	4461.7613636338765
3535. soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered	two of everything just in case he spills anything frankie	got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch	of loper clothing	4137.178696521915
3536. a year after he was catapulted over	nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps	general delivered a peppery annual report	in the form of a happy warless new year greeting to his	pentagon staff	6227.142287277236

3538. after pushing an accumulation of vines	and weeds from the moldboard i lifted the lines from the dust and	found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on	5348.585935849873
3539. little	geeing and hawing have been necessary	93.78509901614532
3540. but shoup also gave	the corps a tilling in spots	560.6610246019457
3541. speaking of pride he deplored	the noncommissioned officer whose uniform looks like it belonged to	someone who retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks or	the bay window	3239.9726764441184

3547. the principal of the school announced	that- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia-	fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in english and mathematics	2739.1174788701246
3548. lacking his needed credits in those subjects fabian will not	graduate with his old classmates next week	2122.5942619274215
3549. south philadelphia high's	principal added that the current delay was caused by the pressure	of a movie that the toneless lad was making	2324.8706220122963

3562. g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards	of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe's best hotels	but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town	of pittsburgh	6170.562978333848
3563. there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth a	reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art	1421.521698637379
3564. last week	in the german city of du^sseldorf g david thompson was	making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause	2816.1186984744263
3565. on display were	343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-	and every single one of them was up for sale	2178.9458244020957
3566. like philadelphia's	late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection	closed to the general public thompson	at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime	4858.414943933886
3567. he made his	fortune during world war 2 when he took over a number of dying	steel plants and kept them alive until the boom	2597.0283609894714
3568. even before he hit	big money he had begun buying modern paintings	965.4625357186399
3569. he gave the impression	of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that	he had an eye for the best	2595.941588569074
3570. he was able to smell a bargain-	and a masterpiece- a continent away and the museum of modern art's	alfred barr said of him: i have never mentioned a new artist	that thompson didn't know about	5781.199216953559
3571. he might barge into a gallery	start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting	1589.3020181192178
3572. he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys	but with dealers he was tough	2126.8698673512063
3573. he bought up cezannes braques matisses	legers a splendid picasso series more than 70 giacometti	sculptures	1263.0953106689544
3574. he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees	in the world	1182.8847302717236
3575. all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone's	throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted	ever got to see them	2592.1729603371896
3576. two years ago thompson offered his	collection to the city	560.8100932887861
3577. but he insisted that it be housed in a special	museum	500.30958217459647
3578. pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had	been snubbing him for years	1422.4004928880465
3579. he went then to a 40-year-old basel art	dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures	1887.5163264078533
3580. last year beyeler arranged to sell $1500000 worth of klees	to the state of north rhine-westphalia which will house them in	a museum that is yet to be built	4626.9576798328
3581. last week most of the other prizes	once offered to pittsburgh went on the block	1097.3438558144464
3582. at the opening	of the du^sseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the	treasures that he was seeing together for the last time	3477.965089203111
3583. in fact he	seemed delighted to get rid of them	370.37202237251415
3584. some observers speculated that	this might be his revenge on his home town	1172.9891576751393
3585. thompson himself said:	i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new	pictures	1567.0997214989798
3586. the university of georgia has long claimed that	it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis	of race or color	3257.909397987696
3587. but in all its 175 years not a single negro	student has entered its classrooms	1102.1067348076194
3588. last week federal district judge	william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately	a qualified negro boy and girl	2835.5903274948478
3589. their entry will crack the	total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate	school in georgia- and in alabama mississippi and south	carolina as well	2863.3410994561486
3590. for 18 months hamilton holmes 19 and	charlayne hunter 18 had tried to get into the university	2130.2468825650258
3591. they graduated	together from atlanta's turner high school where valedictorian	holmes was first in the class and charlayne third	1731.2488974127307
3592. the university	rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never	to mention the color of their skins	2806.6017856878957
3593. holmes went to atlanta's morehouse	college where he is a b+ student and star halfback	1111.345657763458
3594. charlayne studied journalism at detroit's wayne state university	250.7908081124217
3595. last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to	court judge bootle ordered them to apply again	1718.9556181253715
3596. charlayne	was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators	questioned her white roommate at wayne state	2114.746274227739
3597. but holmes was rejected	again on the basis of his record and interview	792.9297879287226
3598. the evidence	in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted	an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through	this ritual by a simple phone conversation	5194.873405768387
3599. holmes was asked if he	had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse	1577.2099582023538
3600. no said he but officials still called him evasive	389.8175984070956
3601. they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested	787.7340697364718
3602. their reason: holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine had his license	suspended	1189.868525777119
3603. negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white	students found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few	had academic records as good as hamilton holmes	2981.1800180778037
3604. the real reason	for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically	cuts off funds for any desegregated school	3261.363844150502
3605. judge bootle's	decision: the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission	to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been	for their race and color	2983.595453474735
3606. the state will appeal- but few think	it will actually try to close the university	1641.5891238632153
3607. surprised and pleased	students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia	this week	1096.2005205180217
3608. when the university of	chicago's chancellor lawrence a kimpton	submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt	gripped the midway	3055.7710638257386
3609. out went letters to 60000 old grads asking for	suggestions	373.495632681448
3610. such academic statesmen as james b conant were consulted	394.60842242060505
3611. two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors including	adlai stevenson richard nixon and harvard's dean mcgeorge	bundy	1414.4579409544492
3612. the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither	a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather	as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it a top scholar in	his own right- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago	6936.443520728591
3613. last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech's	acting dean of the faculty: dynamic geneticist george wells	beadle 57 who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology	for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell	chemistry	4278.883774061259
3614. it fell to chancellor	kimpton now a standard oil executive to spend	his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of	idealist robert maynard hutchins	4290.558566125769
3615. he threw out some of hutchins'	more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment	to 2100 nearly doubled endowment to $139	2033.2739298489155
3616. but though	kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads	feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it	in the heady hutchins era	5282.579280525812
3617. at caltech geneticist beadle	has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology	division since 1946	1889.3674923237681
3618. but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot	recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected	talents in fund raising and speech-making	3687.2719331254593
3619. beadle is even that rare	scientist	who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the	wall street journal and took delight in driving a $250 model a	ford for 22 years then selling it for $300	4027.660312028199
3620. a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began	with the old adam and consequently will never end	3041.9896664790385
3621. but a historian	might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope	that the troubles will sometime pass away	2604.9565480933293
3622. the man was king leopold	2 of the belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better	grab a colony while the grabbing was still good	4072.6065076651334
3623. by force he took under	his protection or stole 900000 square miles of wilderness in central	africa	1413.5396166998119
3624. this is an area nearly as large as western europe;	and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political	or historical unity	4093.392620499417
3625. its boundaries had nothing to do with geography	or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which leopold's	explorers and gunmen got tired of walking	2853.0622123277326
3626. the population	of the congo is 13	142.67233062385577
3627. 5 million divided into at least seven major	culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate	dialects	1418.6947739049713
3628. the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism	paganism ancestor worship and animism	1188.128398117928
3629. the climate ranges from	the steamily equatorial to the temperate	376.9982077050107
3630. the hospitals contain patients	trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars	1177.0371119026693
3631. to make one	nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any	case; it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have	done or failed to do in the congo since 1885	4123.646599291116
3632. at first the	belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property	1424.2935385919784
3633. but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience	642.2112157038775
3634. the belgian government itself took over administration commencing	a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism	2360.193527802002
3635. one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice	on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in	the manner of a father dealing with his children	3461.1286592420015
3636. the honor of the	belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment	1882.2351630249
3637. ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time-	but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child	if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until	then been treated as an infant	4547.0334601564555
3638. the belgians were interested	primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in	copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm	oil	4501.165909610297
3639. the colony was administered from brussels with neither the	congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote	1416.9466830468075
3640. the beneficiaries	of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both	individuals and the belgian government itself held stock	3254.83608148448
3641. in inside	africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale	as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us	say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance	company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various	companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with	the united states government as a heavy partner	5521.141757688372
3642. had	they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese	without compassion	1413.7295039661394
3643. they provided a social	security system which covered all their african employes; their program	of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent;	they put much effort into public housing	3450.1603259226163
3644. they also instituted a ration	system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish	their employes with clothing and adequate food	3690.4043206669135
3645. but instead of	delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at	intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged	to dole it out more often	3439.5911346122434
3646. would not the children if they received all	their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and	later go hungry	3889.716268472709
3647. the belgians also placed great emphasis	on education	166.73005358458562
3648. during the 1950s there were as many as 25000 schools in	the congo	1186.3761284644356
3649. but almost all the schools were primary	94.06137836154747
3650. the average congolese	can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte	and le chien and write his name	3274.2189827213197
3651. some schools were	technical- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit	the land and trained many	1584.2157864666003
3652. but they did not believe in widespread	secondary education much less in college	1176.523394741439
3653. it was their conviction	that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time	until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history	economics and political science	3543.759887838283
3654. indeed the belgians discouraged	higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite	which might cause unrest	2349.6342867321796
3655. when the congo received its independence	in 1960 there were among its 13	785.712397728631
3656. 5 million people exactly 14 university	graduates	141.16460746011848
3657. why did the belgians grant independence to a	colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it	1101.129870337883
3658. in one large oversimplification	it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the	gale of nationalism sweeping africa	3024.5457480613422
3659. they lacked time to prepare	the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies	1269.3131503826637
3660. the	congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most	were unsure what it meant; and in brussels street crowds shouted	pas une goutte de sang!	4071.572260029453
3661. the	belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue;	rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would	wash their hands of the mess	3095.9882579233904
3662. it is hard to blame them for this	249.06581527471081
3663. yet	there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after	independence for which history may not find them guiltless	2029.4477312117313
3664. as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no	fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university	graduate	3699.1928275917226
3665. there were four principal ones	14.968518817486785
3666. first there were those	congolese who favored splitting the	country into small independent states balkanizing it	1877.329822751553
3667. second there	were those who favored near-balkanization a loose	federalism having a central government of limited authority with	much power residing in the states	2455.5167750977494
3668. third there were those	who favored a unified congo with a very strong central	government	1647.6938093125234
3669. and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry	for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up	2026.6089623851428
3670. however	the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting	749.4879851405202
3671. a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation	of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure	that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration	3234.9638721098563
3672. they had divided the congo into six provinces- leopoldville	kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern- unfortunately	with little regard for ethnic groupings	3266.424937016796
3673. thus some provinces contained	tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant	an opportunity for war	1573.458846754533
3674. the belgian congo was granted its independence	with what seemed a workable western-style form of government:	there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature	elected by universal suffrage in the provinces	5763.608306017597
3675. well-wishers	around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable	position in the society of nations	1735.367618443057
3676. if internal frictions arose	they could be handled by the 25000-man congolese army the force	publique which had been trained and was still officered by white	belgians	4290.278243774417
3677. the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator	and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man	1262.5086581651933
3678. twenty-four	hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting	each other	757.4256918631274
3679. presently the well-armed members of the force publique-	many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes	erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting	2606.917722510285
3680. terror engulfed the thousands	of belgian civilians who had remained in the country	1172.6844156915968
3681. the belgian	government decided to act and on july 10 dispatched paratroops	to the congo	1106.7975302404816
3682. on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of	katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from	the country	3272.2226567105
3683. confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought	new acts of violence	503.3537978010173
3684. lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military	intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations	to send troops to oust them	3885.314789030578
3685. on july 14 the security	council-	with france and great britain abstaining- voted the resolution	which drew the un into the congo	2205.487340103954
3686. vague in wording it	called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general	to take the necessary steps h to provide the congolese	government with such military assistance as may be necessary until	through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical	assistance of the united nations the national security forces	may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks	h	8832.761005155015
3687. secretary-general hammarskjo^ld decided that it	would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were	to come from african or at least nonwhite nations- certainly not	from the us	russia great britain or france	3884.1094386646764
3688. he quickly	called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched	troops within hours	1657.240436163859
3689. ultimately the un army in the congo	reached a top strength of 19000 including about 5000 from india	and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites	3330.412383688593
3690. it took the un three months to bring a modest form of	order to the congo	1892.9785591738062
3691. the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops	and often obstructed un efforts	796.3740593292034
3692. the wildly erratic nature	of patrice lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced	that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with	the belgians and appealed to russia for help	5476.0424302594965
3693. little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist	263.42371657760907
3694. before appealing	to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us	lumumba further complicated	the un's mission by initiating small wars with the	secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under	albert kalonji wanted to secede as well	6724.536890194165
3695. meanwhile russia took every	opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for	his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening	on occasion to intervene openly	2748.996105096023
3696. but by the end of the three-month	period in october 1960 something approaching calm settled on	the congo	2360.251942794049
3697. president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and	fired him	264.0566890165347
3698. control of the government- such	control as there was and such government as there was- passed into	the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army	4638.2654305985725
3699. mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any	significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their	obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york	3312.664080309275
3700. the belgians- at least officially- departed from the congo as well	withdrawing all of their uniformed troops	2126.3657320257025
3701. but they left behind	them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or	mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga	the seceded province which according to tshombe holds 65% of	the mineral wealth of the entire country	4288.088652082281
3702. from october 1960	to february 1961 the un forces in the congo took little action	1650.3708083936253
3703. there was no directive for it- the security council's resolution	had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united	nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political	affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize	it	4725.923520108519
3704. during the five-month lull civil war smoldered and	flickered throughout the congo	969.416079419475
3705. in february the murder of patrice	lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of	tshombe again stirred the un to action	2600.171243096827
3706. on feb 21 the	council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate	measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including	h the use of force if necessary in the last resort	5931.158237769608
3707. although	the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably	tougher than the earlier one	1411.9687510633505
3708. it also urged that the un	eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military	and political advisers; ordered an investigation of lumumba's	death; urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the	reorganization of the army	6319.069738583905
3709. though president john	f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin	and disarmament adviser mccloy's unexpected report from khrushchev	his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved	him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week	4382.305317189972
3710. high up on the president's priority list was the thorny question	of bizerte	1184.1381804005546
3711. on this issue the president received a detailed	report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson who had just	returned from paris and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search	for a face-saving	way- for both paris and tunis- out of the imbroglio	4325.286100764867
3712. ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status	quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing	their forces from the mediterranean base	4700.652032676828
3713. to continue their important	conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of	other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for	the weekend	2735.4591200058453
3714. the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with	the no 2 man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi	ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support	4813.96755184527
3715. the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the	positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable	1251.2103944288858
3716. through ladgham	mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian	president habib bourguiba; and one us official said: the	key question now is which side picks up the phone first	5196.7270285094655
3717. on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary	of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay	and the inter-american economic and social council		2146.668783310022
3718. main purpose of the	meeting: to discuss president kennedy's alliance for progress	963.0307778949206
3719. and that was not all	14.725399016794892
3720. in conferences with nationalist china's	dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy	assured chiang kai-shek's emissary that the us is as	firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united	nations	5795.298455665154
3721. chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission	of outer mongolia; however the president who would like to woo	the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would	promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer	mongolia's admission comes to a vote	4970.951141672936
3722. the president	also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking	more foreign aid	1893.2587142690095
3723. to africa he sent his most trusted adviser	his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a good-will mission	to the ivory coast	2189.6517230294294
3724. all week long the president clearly was playing	a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect he was practicing	what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he	declared:	we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems	with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with	reason	7924.347208853322
3725. from international airport	in los angeles to international airport in houston as the	great four-jet boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes	including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio	3767.3746627879545
3726. when	continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11:30 one	night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer	3890.1213508172214
3727. the plane put down on schedule at 1:35 am in phoenix	500.9046153157624
3728. thirty-one minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly	anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention	to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard	5609.087943502838
3729. at 3:58 am	with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert	berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the	man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward	the cockpit	4210.23500044544
3730. the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach	berry said	1175.8536249345461
3731. i figured he was sick	14.823117479526648
3732. john salvador a	farmer from palm desert calif was sitting up front and could	see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit	3706.4486246035485
3733. the kid had	a 	1.7343917281062526
3734. 45 automatic like they issue in the army he said	558.7511267471195
3735. the other	fellow had a 	7.315261204380347
3736. salvador saw the youth hold his 	30.24156069930489
3737. 45 against the	head of stewardess lois carnegey; the man put his 	346.9142509449402
3738. 38 at the head	of capt byron d rickards	391.16969023136187
3739. to rickards a 52-year-old	veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story: his plane was	being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when	peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa	4296.397305355169
3740. but	last week's pirates like the cuban-american who recently hijacked	an eastern airlines electra wanted to	go to havana	2599.336436316916
3741. tell your company there are four	of us here	with guns the elder man told rickards	1247.300797168369
3742. the pilot radioed	el paso international airport with just that message	751.0357502768757
3743. but he	told the skyjackers the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach	havana; they would have to refuel at el paso	2181.641603825231
3744. most passengers	didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground	1180.9519844741485
3745. jerry mccauley of sacramento calif one of some twenty air force	recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion	1887.3293584709331
3746. the old man	came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers	to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand	4842.376998680671
3747. i thought he was the air force recruiter	168.18768054755438
3748. what the man	wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew	1651.2077989449037
3749. they chose four: jack casey who works for continental airlines	in houston; fred mullen from mercer island wash;	pfc	truman cleveland of st augustine	2454.294760136501
3750. fla and leonard gilman	a former college boxer and veteran of the us immigration	service border patrol	2132.4655547669145
3751. everybody else was allowed to file off the	plane after it touched down at el paso at 4:18 am	1727.6084595586133
3752. they found a large welcoming group- el paso policemen border patrol	sheriff's deputies and fbi men who surged around the	plane with rifles and submarine guns	4069.474724447394
3753. other fbi men talking with	the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed	flight to havana	1890.728912947675
3754. the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty	minutes took fully three hours	1646.510584814557
3755. still more time was consumed while	the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert	six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for	a propeller-driven douglas dc-7	3556.55654982911
3756. actually the officers	on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with	any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight	from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that	it was four followers of cuba's fidel castro who had taken over	the 707	7767.036787964049
3757. mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the	attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone	2183.409198420593
3758. at	one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a	cuban plot the president talked about invoking a total embargo on	trade with cuba	4474.194371778308
3759. as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas	sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close	enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment	3373.973517665853
3760. from the	luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans	were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden	50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge ariz and his son cody	16 a high-school junior	5646.668879366906
3761. the heat and strain began	to tell on the beardens	373.8230711703159
3762. the father by accident or perhaps to show	as he said we mean business took the 	1132.0041509118373
3763. 45 and fired a slug	between the legs of second officer norman simmons	790.3904962835377
3764. at 7:30 am	more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum:	take off or see the hostages killed	3068.8372319006603
3765. the tower	cleared the plane for take-off at 8 am and captain rickards	began taxiing toward the runway	1565.7826640933195
3766. several police cars loaded with	armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the	big jet	2355.1130741297757
3767. the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard	engines; the plane slowed to a halt	1570.4286148278854
3768. ambulances baggage trucks	and cars surrounded it	140.48316919396726
3769. at 12:50 pm	a ramp was rolled up to the plane	500.02939396731773
3770. a few minutes later fbi agent	francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed	2354.1065600583715
3771. while crosby distracted the beardens stewardesses carnegey	and toni besset dropped out of a rear door	1251.6360591850685
3772. so did hostages casey	cleveland and mullen	139.9257388512287
3773. that left only the four crew members crosby	and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens	1419.0121429226388
3774. the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket	1653.6953868627716
3775. gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance	372.7703611728348
3776. he caught	officer simmons' eye nodded toward young bearden and- i	swung my right as hard as i could	2604.1543243510478
3777. simmons and crosby jumped the boy	and it was all over	501.40241525799877
3778. frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48	pm the beardens were held in bail of $100000 each on charges	of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines	4449.989487954163
3779. back home in coolidge ariz his 36-year-old wife	mary said: i thought they were going to phoenix to look for	jobs	2019.6520917987189
3780. taking precedence over all other	legislation on	capitol hill last week was the military strength of	the nation	2361.323308467804
3781. the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed	speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime	defense budget in us history	2863.642674175798
3782. with the money all	but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of	the 225000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested	the armed forces would be increased by only 160000	5476.332894245742
3783. the hold-back	as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary	expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually	and thus the new funds spent prudently	3236.964907696351
3784. in all the senate	signed a check for $46	391.2265284143847
3785. 7 billion which not only included the extra	$3	262.7533980046659
3786. 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy but	tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for	3056.3235743584896
3787. senate on its own decided to provide additional b-52 and other	the house which	had passed its smaller appropriation before the president's urgent	call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense	budget in short order	4151.2712424817355
3788. in other areas congressional action last	week included:    the senate and the house	passed and sent to the white house the compromise	farm bill which the president is expected to sign not too unhappily	5490.006304692954
3789. the senate also voted $5	14.798609551242151
3790. 2 billion to finance the government's	health welfare and labor activities	754.2712739335136
3791. debate on the	all-important foreign-aid	bill with its controversial long-range proposals	had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend	2033.3417011613033
3792. white house	legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact	956.9195686789277
3793. most members of the us senate	because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they	can	2030.3479988442045
3794. but because they are politicians they like to talk as poor-mouth	as the lowliest voter	1647.8383156422012
3795. as a result ever since 1851 when the senate	restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building the senators	have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they	opposed every move that might improve it	4119.00933542238
3796. over the years enlivened	chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho	potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all-american course	3702.816561921093
3797. individual	senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced	smelts from michigan soft-shell crabs from maryland oysters	from washington grapefruit from florida	2606.3577775395574
3798. but plain old bean soup	served daily	since the turn of the century	made clear to the citizenry that	the senate's stomach was in the right place	4286.6916963843705
3799. in a daring	stroke the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute	cuisine and hired a $10000-per-year french-born maitre d'hotel	2338.060010612313
3800. holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly	reports on operation of the turnpikes	1654.8441081127662
3801. long-term trend	of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward	375.1038875035834
3802. higher toll rates	also are helping boost revenues	252.28826607285146
3803. result is a better prospect	for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative	1565.8916987042821
3804. things are looking up these days for many of the	state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road	bonds	3281.4135130130394
3805. traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing	261.5331346686727
3806. that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll	gates	1181.7191151416519
3807. as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors	who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright	speculations are now finding new hope for their investments	3111.5273748654345
3808. another	result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these	tax-exempt bonds	1880.8581335949652
3809. other tax-exempt bonds of state and local	governments hit a price peak on february 21 according to standard	+ poor's average	1212.223741897019
3810. on balance prices of those bonds have slipped	a bit since then	954.8884128091491
3811. however in the same three-month period toll-road	bonds as a group have bucked this trend	1100.3920174800853
3812. on these bonds price rises	since february 21 easily outnumber price declines	958.7407729665932
3813. investors however still see an element of more-than-ordinary	risk in the toll-road bonds	788.7731215365361
3814. you find the evidence of that in the	chart on this page	949.7489877358051
3815. many of the toll-road bonds still are selling	at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent	or very close to that	2847.2720399344535
3816. and this is true in the case of some turnpikes	on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which	the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on	the bonds	5918.9530701264675
3817. that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be	had on good corporation bonds	1409.3274275091258
3818. it's not much more in fact than	the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds	2113.595341347186
3819. for	investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax-free yield	of 4 per cent is high	1731.769898814131
3820. it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried	investor with more than $16000 of income to be taxed or for	a married couple with more than $32000 of taxed income	5310.948463788951
3821. a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the	most recent 12-month period- ending in february or march- shows	what is happening	2593.6096953582087
3822. the report is based on a survey by blyth + company	investment bankers	515.0337608505371
3823. nearly all the turnpikes show gains in	net revenues during the period	644.6143772644062
3824. and there is the bright note:	the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late	in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession	4843.360281260311
3825. many	of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter	638.3801002466354
3826. indication:	the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward	389.41981198554294
3827. look	for example at the ohio turnpike	93.92641117475894
3828. traffic on that road slumped	sharply in january and february as compared with those same months	in 1960	2356.79541234648
3829. then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues-	after operating costs	946.4124017887787
3830. as a result the road's net revenues	in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest	payments on the turnpike bonds	4295.058163053131
3831. that was up from 173 per cent	in the preceding 12 months	644.5718137584279
3832. that same pattern of earnings shows	up on the massachusetts turnpike	752.2690295096012
3833. operating revenues were off in	the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in march	1877.2807140670277
3834. costs were held down despite a bitter winter	252.650927227687
3835. for the	year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121	per cent in the preceding period	2028.0129169395998
3836. the road's engineers look for further	improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston	1418.9305342883986
3837. some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough	to prove what they can do	1249.2456530751426
3838. the 187-mile illinois state toll	highway	for example was not opened over its entire length until december 1958	2344.58391182701
3839. in the 12 months ended in february 1960 the highway earned enough	to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid	out of initial reserves	3087.8131021275776
3840. in the 12 months ended in february 1961	this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest	2089.863030136462
3841. in the first two months of 1961 earnings of the	illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent	from early 1960	2443.5536120675274
3842. success for many turnpikes has come hard	140.51825862222887
3843. traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates	502.26526335601267
3844. in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to	toll-rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or	better	connections with other highways	4082.1710492507154
3845. many rate increases already	have been put into effect	261.44880488819547
3846. higher tolls are planned for july 1	1961 on the richmond-petersburg va turnpike and proposals for	increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study	3901.6350133187507
3847. progress is being made too in improving motorists' access	to many turnpikes	641.5885740541793
3848. the kansas turnpike offers an illustration	65.19217787279139
3849. net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements	in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb 28	1961	2975.229367772795
3850. further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike	are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at wichita	and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in	both kansas city kans and kansas city mo	6289.570411684938
3851. meanwhile there	appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover	the interest deficiency for eight more years	2038.236705000893
3852. investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find	that not all roads are nearing their goals	1870.7678032451881
3853. traffic and revenues	on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners	and investors alike	1415.8009374902535
3854. if nothing is done the prospect is that that	road will be in default of interest in 1962	2351.6234537150826
3855. west virginia toll bonds	have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement	in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same	2863.105583242979
3856. the typical picture at this	time is one of steady improvement	752.9731635270616
3857. it's going to take time	for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in	full	1872.7593228125813
3858. already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough	to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins	1875.042685661816
3859. many others are	attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even	point	1100.064910116415
3860. a top american official after a look at europe's	factories thinks the us is in a very serious situation	competitively	2827.788617689719
3861. commerce secretary luther hodges	accompanied by a member of our staff on may 10 toured plants of	two of italy's biggest companies- fiat the auto producer	and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines	3652.2309271171107
3862. our staff man cabled from turin as follows-   follow	secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this:	one modern equipment- much of it supplied under the	marshall plan- enables fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day	6210.194899742826
3863. about	half of these are exported	43.85063991010053
3864. two wage costs are a fraction	of the us costs	560.2544033689617
3865. a skilled worker on the assembly line	for example earns $37 a week	790.2223849203336
3866. three labor troubles	are infrequent	22.105202763518218
3867. fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more	than six years	787.8381181302814
3868. said secretary hodges: 'it's a tough	combination for the us to face'	961.5583113722157
3869. olivetti	had a special interest for hodges	93.91165187423078
3870. olivetti took over underwood	the us typewriter maker in late 1959	755.3127434894418
3871. within a year without	reducing wages underwood's production costs were cut one third	prices were slashed	1247.9895536054698
3872. the result has been that exports of underwood	products have doubled	746.78946133524
3873. the olivetti plant near turin has	modern layout modern machinery	374.01961820387635
3874. the firm is design-conscious	sales-conscious advertising-conscious	64.65330262554015
3875. hodges is	trying	to get more foreign business to go to the us	788.476566169829
3876. the inflow	of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments	958.0478591597719
3877. hodges predicted: 'i think we will see more foreign firms	coming to the us	946.3110649121438
3878. there are many places where we can use their	vigor and new ideas'	1186.326564063828
3879. foreign competition has	become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new	ways of handling competitive imports	1725.6071797660911
3880. the recently unveiled	kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be	significant for american businessmen in many lines	2813.0360771490296
3881. important	aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these:   an	international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting	countries will be called shortly by president kennedy	2744.9148050358763
3882. chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting	393.7811788194976
3883. the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized	countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed	countries over the years	2329.023180711939
3884. point is that developing countries	often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to	get on their feet	2584.3495014607865
3885. if they have trouble exporting international bill	for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would	1411.645234726828
3886. idea	is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible	1187.7576335494973
3887. at the same time another purpose of the conference	will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports-	especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing	countries	3090.027008781116
3888. japan since 1957 has been voluntarily	curbing exports of textiles to the us	1181.9965653461848
3889. hong kong	india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types	of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact	2325.5734610092927
3890. none of these countries is happy with these arrangements	396.5683396632063
3891. the japanese want to increase exports to the us	while they have been curbing shipments they have watched hong kong	step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market	3426.0463204319494
3892. hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports	to britain while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into	british market unrestrictedly	2834.871394307522
3893. the indians and pakistanis	are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for	similar reasons	1254.1043326239278
3894. the kennedy hope is that at the conference	or through bilateral talks the low-wage textile-producing countries	in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause	friction all around and may result in import quotas	5626.234508831154
3895. gradual	controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what president	kennedy wants	791.8555394183409
3896. this may point the way toward international stabilization	agreements in other products	963.1596621757759
3897. it's an important clue	to washington thinking	93.46005078714207
3898. note too that the kennedy	textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us	textile industry	2145.514428834589
3899. get competitive or get out	14.67353846833438
3900. in	veiled terms that's what the kennedy administration is saying to	the american textile industry	1657.7171594893523
3901. the government will help in	transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization	doesn't seem feasible	1414.7113775128605
3902. special depreciation on new textile machinery	may be allowed	390.6975713610694
3903. government research will look into new	products and methods	263.02395499552455
3904. import quotas aren't ruled out	where the national interest is involved	759.7661341184564
3905. but the kennedy administration	doesn't favor import quotas	167.94036098310843
3906. rather they are impressed	with the british government's success in forcing- and helping-	the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to	other products	4100.038724599065
3907. what's happening in textiles can be handwriting	on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with	imports from low-wage countries	2036.3493236437084
3908. among the highest-paid workers	in the world are us coal miners	752.5608215857053
3909. yet us coal is	cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water	638.0541269253741
3910. steel	company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in	virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be	able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets	5462.429462736842
3911. virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about	$2	500.04930833252894
3912. 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines	1185.4220121694855
3913. us coal is cheap despite high wages because	of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates	on ocean freight	2028.6413249704856
3914. many of the coal seams in the nationalized british	mines are twisting narrow and very deep	1892.3065988229605
3915. productivity	of us miners is twice that of the british	373.5794511948208
3916. welsh	coal miners communist-led are up in arms at the suggestion that	the steel company bring in american coal	2575.154863927034
3917. the british government will have to decide whether to let	us coal in	782.8982869585612
3918. the british coal industry is unprofitable has large	coal stocks it can't sell	1175.6426999323621
3919. every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes	beyond the five-cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian	say apologetically i'm sorry but we don't have that	book	3545.824268902241
3920. there wouldn't be much demand for it i'm afraid	389.6316334248524
3921. behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget	problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest	2189.478478650937
3922. what to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15000 book titles	1176.0693625266447
3923. what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and	nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when	your budget is pitifully small	2979.8755158807303
3924. most library budgets are hopelessly	inadequate	65.0783136101934
3925. a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually	which includes the librarian's salary and not even the new	york public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's	richest city	3662.994745269886
3926. the plight of a small community library is proportionately	worse	563.1496252804885
3927. confronted with this situation most libraries	either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they	can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and	local governments to supplement their annual funds	4118.536011296293
3928. in some parts of	the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under	the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the	state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional	basis	6206.049151077155
3929. new york state has what is probably the most advanced	of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become	a model for others to follow	2851.8822254825513
3930. because it is so large a state with	marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new	york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works	4480.021060341582
3931. at	one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries	in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated	area	2735.4050374719045
3932. at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library	system in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly	growing territory to serve	4081.9883785785582
3933. both these types and those	in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries	that began at albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the	legislature of county library systems financed by county governments	with matching funds from the state	4686.409819897802
3934. it was a step in the right direction	but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully	the thriving systems of today	3881.1540559380614
3935. under this law annual grants are	given to systems in substantial amounts	638.7054133127103
3936. an earlier difficulty was	overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might	join or not as they saw fit	3466.3759380751135
3937. some library boards are wary of the	plan	168.0381165790576
3938. a large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller	ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too	great	3886.1239178690435
3939. a small library may cherish its independence and established	ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems	radical to older members of the board	2849.643442602746
3940. within a system however	the autonomy of each member library is preserved	955.6120577750769
3941. the local community	maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library	program facilities and services but wider resources and additional	services become available through membership in a system	3211.5064752396534
3942. all	services are given without cost to members	249.66990707488702
3943. so obvious are these advantages	that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state	now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day	not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to	a co-op	4552.767404986944
3944. to set up a co-operative library system the law	requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as	the nucleus and the system is organized around it	4493.342711307468
3945. the collection may	be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection	1562.645639654292
3946. each system develops differently according to the area it serves	but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for	maximum efficiency	4098.247216815486
3947. the basic state grant is thirty cents for each	person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides	an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends	a certain number of dollars	4230.40654213191

3949. this system by virtue of its variety	and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation	1572.2273800383941
3950. the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference	service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge	and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area	5140.441832744933
3951. the	need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual	libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford	2039.057007112498
3952. nassau	is currently building a central collection of reference materials	in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100000	volumes by 1965	3674.32847571592
3953. the major part of this collection is in the	central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five	libraries in the system designated as subject centers	2866.088620381982
3954. basic	reference	tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization	in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries	3671.948573100265
3955. on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york	times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound	volumes of important periodicals	3107.142646823598
3956. the entire headquarters collection	is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans	1636.8609305124755

3958. it is connected	by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any	book to a system that the system itself cannot provide	3892.06003082982
3959. the books are	carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other	libraries	1259.8101226325089
3960. each subject center library was chosen because	of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters	could then build upon	3030.844964307994
3961. east meadow has philosophy psychology and	religion; freeport houses social science pure science and language;	history biography and education are centered in hempstead; levittown	has applied science business and literature; while hewlett-woodmere	is the repository of art music and foreign languages	4307.9639087089945
3962. the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant	and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen	local reference service	4092.2236399619396
3963. this kind of cooperation is not	wholly new of course	374.68654656283894
3964. public libraries in nassau county have been	lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system	enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive	basis	5330.134559518066
3965. local libraries find too that the new plan saves	tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since	the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would	be available to an individual library	4284.970727773925
3966. the system passes on these	savings to its members	391.25268325713205
3967. further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping	and clerical detail as the result of central billing	1420.430904736176
3968. books are not the only resource of the system	393.5870240960829

3970. the most recent film	catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the	collection any of which may be borrowed without charge	3653.6561727244566
3971. this catalogue	lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults	although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook	of the north the emperor's nightingale and the	red balloon	3445.5300322189723
3972. workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual	consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective	use of film as a library service	3891.3022907104933
3973. the system well understands	that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children	and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian	at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned	library activities cooperating with the children's librarians	in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops	and frequent visits	5000.227154083771
3974. headquarters has also set up a central juvenile	book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of	purchasing and selection	2828.498384612913
3975. sample copies of new books are on display	at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in	workshop groups	2037.0438808765477
3976. story hours pre-school programs activities with	community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province	of the children's consultant	3245.4089129768427
3977. headquarters of the nassau	system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand	beyond its boundaries	1577.2608149402702
3978. the system itself is governed	by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership	940.0630045743352
3979. in nassau as in other systems the long-range objective	is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and	on adult education in general	4472.165133291163
3980. librarians a patient breed of men	and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results	today	1879.8787558323697
3981. library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers	are those maligned americans the teen-agers	2125.0869342219116
3982. to them especially	the librarians with the help of co-ops hope they will never have to	say i'm sorry we don't have that book	2455.207151378409
3983. today more than ever before the survival of our free society	depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned	3051.180622945808
3984. the	great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our	own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western	world	2600.4090946869865
3985. the need for lifetime reading is apparent	141.17209537967716
3986. education must not	be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our	entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation	can cope with the dangers that threaten our society	4045.2717647166223
3987. the desire	and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life	1176.0870514584758
3988. we	cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not	discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we	do read	3217.931760068326
3989. we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific	age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint	that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom	absorbed from the written word	6351.069365896247
3990. a fundamental source of knowledge	in the world today is the book found in our libraries	1264.8700901080579
3991. although	progress has been made in america's system of libraries it still	falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that	are needed for an informed america	5152.688466339052
3992. the problem grows in intensity	each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge	to the written word continue to expand	2464.8031412268742
3993. the inadequacy of our	library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct	this condition	2110.694691223495
3994. there are for example approximately 25000000	people in this country with no public library service and about 50000000	with inadequate service	2030.2503979928465
3995. in college libraries 57 per cent of the	total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed	last year by the us office of education	4435.667589771811
3996. and over 66 per	cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any	library at all	2022.3626852621321
3997. in every aspect of service- to the public	to children in schools to colleges and universities- the library	of today is failing to render vitally needed services	4293.079758201602
3998. only public	understanding and support can provide that service	263.3453319459758
3999. this is	one of the main reasons for national library week april 16-22 and	for its theme: for a richer fuller life read!	the general assembly which	adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle	from the day it convened	6710.815150642082
4000. it was faced immediately with a showdown	on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the	governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education	3223.013490560467
4001. there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in	which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers	2367.118202156181
4002. the	final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening	budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information	they need	2457.8271127389035
4003. long-range planning of programs and ways to finance	them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid	crisis-to-crisis government	3897.737865333728
4004. this session for instance may have	insured	a financial crisis two years from now	948.2820626469871
4005. in all the turmoil	some good legislation was passed	391.88150602011444
4006. some other good bills were lost	in the shuffle and await future action	785.0981246267694
4007. certainly all can applaud passage	of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher	pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility	for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate	as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the	road maintenance bond issue	8073.175016982309
4008. no action has been taken however	on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification	of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks	sales	3222.637438662675
4009. only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal	question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state	3264.7550558035264
4010. the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations	questions	789.9166985557297
4011. fortunately it spared us from the usual spate	of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like	anything but the empire state of the south	4497.098946294459
4012. we congratulate	the entire membership on its record of good legislation	498.50906767649684
4013. in the	interim between now and next year we trust the house and senate will	put their minds to studying georgia's very real economic fiscal	and social problems and come up with answers without all the political	heroics	6060.401974616092
4014. the	league of women voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting	financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive	2191.4377926363877
4015. it's a	good use of money	64.56586200211402
4016. these women whose organization grew out of	the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson's dictum	that one must cherish the people's spirit but keep alive their	attention	3101.8118255467316
4017. if once they become inattentive to the public	affairs jefferson said you and i and congress and assemblies	judges and governors shall all become wolves	3896.5581643316086
4018. newspapermen	and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention	and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs	1737.125221620232
4019. the league	workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and	make them available to the public	3049.7224869218467
4020. the harder the choice the more willing	the league is to wade in	792.0385497268474
4021. and the league takes a stand with great	regularity on the side of right	1412.9424107737464
4022. industrial progress	cities and counties interested in industrial	development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled	toward the 13 northwest	georgia counties that are members of the coosa	valley area planning and development commission	4130.051011140219
4023. coupling	its own budget of $83750 with a $30000 state grant authorized by	gov vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in march with	georgia tech	4282.466352306202
4024. then a full-time planning office will be established	in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff	for development of an area planning and industrial development program	3102.9782955683613
4025. the undertaking has abundant promise	22.10689138326263
4026. it recognizes the fact	that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding	together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than	through the go-it-alone approach	3326.3908113174607
4027. states defense	the rusk belief in balanced defense replacing	the	dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that	has existed	3275.5829633139406
4028. the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs	would deter russia's use of hers; that theory was and is	sound	2186.2218226076716
4029. the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence	was enough	952.7444180030495
4030. by limiting american strength too much to nuclear	strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war	besides a nuclear war	2450.8852647112667
4031. this strategy heightened the possibility that	we would have a nuclear war	963.0833378620048
4032. it also weakened our diplomatic	stance because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear	war except in the ultimate extremity	2323.5754725623246
4033. this left the soviets	plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable	impunity	1647.0115141230356
4034. by maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing	american military forces to fight conventional wars too secretary	of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more	muscle and greater safety into our military position	3773.3748630178284
4035. shows county is on beam	dekalb's budget for 1961 is a record	one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance	4278.8015276862225
4036. it includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation	of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed-up	industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential	services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and	road maintenance	4309.16373183942
4037. that such expansion can be obtained without	a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal	planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by chairman	charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust	he was given was well placed and other county officials	7791.4083623313945
4038. somebody is bound to love us	g mennen williams is learning	the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly	1263.9361233963439
4039. touring africa the new	us assistant secretary of state observed africa should be	for the africans and the british promptly denounced him	3276.6959117490496
4040. then he	arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying american	imperialists go home	1095.811719487202
4041. backs confidence with dollars	confidence in the state's economic	future is reflected in the georgia power company's record construction	budget for this year	3477.3246867649477
4042. the firm does a large amount of	research and its forecasts have meaning	786.7471341362805
4043. it is good to know that georgia	will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet	the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of	industrialization	5162.344016150813
4044. georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost	from the general assembly in the form of a $1750000 budget increase	for the milledgeville state hospital	2754.288416295339
4045. actually it amounts	to $1250000 above what the institution already is receiving considering	the additional half-million dollars gov vandiver allocated	last year from the state surplus	4089.864389900732
4046. either way it sounds like	a sizable hunk of money and is	644.5951118876487
4047. but exactly how far it will go toward	improving conditions is another question because there is so much that	needs doing	3040.432558025417
4048. the practice of charging employes for meals whether	they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished	1577.1052112462476
4049. the work week	of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be	reduced	2361.864461129084
4050. more attendants nurses and doctors should be hired	167.3128293062633
4051. patients deserve more attention than they are getting	248.4769466179037
4052. even with	the increase in funds for the next fiscal year georgia will be spending	only around $3	1575.994423991061
4053. 15 per day per patient	22.239038646386668
4054. the national average is	more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental	health field to be too low	2323.3059213762413
4055. kansas regarded as tops in the nation in	its treatment of the mentally ill spends $9 per day per patient	2818.2299477940915
4056. georgia has made some reforms true	43.751860262065975
4057. the intensive treatment program	is working well	140.58779213881957
4058. but in so many other areas we still are dragging	371.6471872098124
4059. considering what is being done compared to what needs to be	done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning	toward making the best possible use of the increase granted	5329.742308477169
4060. the	boost is helpful but inadequate	43.14915273757537
4061. assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive	to men of good conscience	958.2765160115307
4062. rafael trujillo the often-blood thirsty	dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years perhaps deserved	his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history	2316.5203773485555
4063. but whether the murder	of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people	of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered	4286.226498244427
4064. trujillo knew a great deal about assassination	94.71781389583387
4065. the responsibility	for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus	maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york	has been laid at his door	4643.005174903431
4066. he had been involved in countless schemes	to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such	as president romulo betancourt of venezuela	2320.9650243842416
4067. it was a sort of poetic	justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow	the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican	arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has	been uncovered and quashed	6536.139826436638
4068. the recent history of the dominican	republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly	benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive	2731.825093116975
4069. unquestionably	trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved	public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and	investment and raised the standard of living notably	4666.860578563952
4070. but the price	was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition	942.4877189798679
4071. el benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth	249.97169314406543
4072. the jails were	filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his	displeasure	936.5395279438019
4073. he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states	and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his	influence extended even to congress	3489.6071806737236
4074. until the last year or so	the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article	of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession	was accepted here as evidence of his good character	3944.4472525449646
4075. tardily the government	here	came to understand how this country's own reputation was	tarnished by the association with repression	2581.616985113421
4076. last year after trujillo	had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the	united states and many other members of the organization of american	states broke diplomatic relations with him	3340.092715704992
4077. thereupon followed	a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines	564.7438064307134
4078. trujillo's	dictatorship had been along conservative right-wing lines	167.69046323086337
4079. but	after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist	slogans	962.8785957491034
4080. there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with	castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo- thus	illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces	3330.24605967869
4081. what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle	251.68052651048288
4082. the	dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little	freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been	suppressed	2177.712637916434
4083. perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but	the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger	2593.3760775029446
4084. the dominican	republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily	as toward western freedom	947.0123582767603
4085. such a twist would be a tragedy for	the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear	2119.390302940572
4086. for that	reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative	government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy	and help	2475.0023158198155
4087. high-speed buses on the george	washington memorial parkway operating between downtown washington	and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute	an	alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency	can do for this city	5913.8946716843475
4088. in presenting plans for such express buses	before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta	c darwin stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for	the projects his agency will soon be launching	3551.9031787050417
4089. such support should	not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta	are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into	the downtown area	5310.030847905222
4090. because the buses would not stop on the	parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed	2035.0335314735064
4091. the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose	from the present session of congress	2109.1093657306155
4092. the inference has been too	widely	accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades	across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of	that living city	3089.9769030586576
4093. so far as the record is concerned the western	powers have not acquiesced and should not do so	2377.2960480828633
4094. though walter	ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east	germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of	east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone	4032.0020935941816
4095. the wartime protocol of september 12 1944 designated a special greater	berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint	occupation	3275.3671361593492
4096. it was not a part of any one of the three	zones for occupation by soviet american british and french troops	respectively	2178.841163385464
4097. after the berlin blockade and airlift the council	of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the	effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin	4811.261869493489
4098. for some time the communists honored the distinction	between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin	by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas	3114.948929242516
4099. then they moved	offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin	and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany	3898.6586580167836
4100. that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border	have not	been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which	britain	france and the united states sent to moscow after the latter's	gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other	west german officials to west berlin	5029.109808069654
4101. the chancellor had as	much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin- and was certainly	less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard	eisler	4080.1231687949853
4102. the british and other replies to that moscow note	pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to integrate east	berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting	to make it the capital of east germany	4121.762672063813
4103. they insisted on	the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a quadripartite	status	1652.5047144451921
4104. this is far from acknowledging or recognizing	those efforts as an accomplished fact	795.4746208772423
4105. there remains of course the	question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent	the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts	3716.901889841762
4106. one ground	of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over	into west berlin as communist vopos try to gun down fleeing	unarmed residents	2757.0456319467553
4107. another remained when an american army car was	recovered but with a broken glass	1409.0535702274162
4108. the glass may seem trivial but communist	official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed	1407.7569568347787
4109. remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the	west german misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped	that	the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy's	representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future	indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed	7625.720910094467
4110. national park	thousands of buffalo	grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug	upon the rolling dusty-green grassland	1265.2778115930034
4111. a horizon even and seamless	binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth	1414.0950227952144
4112. that	picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of	those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any	later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood	4029.721067396042
4113. for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the	endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans	the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the	ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill	6810.033608627295
4114. the national	park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county	northeast kansas as a prairie national park	1886.5695925736898
4115. there the	buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth-eaten zoo	specimens	1887.6441004127882
4116. wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved	501.8803500947423
4117. grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn-	as the first settlers saw them	1885.7536794941043
4118. the park service makes	an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new	park	1091.4149028991164
4119. american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to	approve	955.8309767492079
4120. a philadelphia distiller is currently	breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising	on tv and radio	1259.3510248171085
4121. starting with small stations not members of	the national association of broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking	to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations	4074.993583802493
4122. probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional	action requiring the federal communications commission	to ban such advertising through its licensing power	2720.8762657319917
4123. the national	association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor	commercials	557.5520464431881
4124. past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this	policy	503.73094916822663
4125. even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific	prohibition	759.5735214791048
4126. why then with these voluntary barricades and	some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional	action	1895.2750915158715
4127. simply because the subverting action of firms that are	not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv	stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread	5152.077128240761
4128. soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want	to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly	from the efforts of non-code competitors	3109.984389625917
4129. although the	false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly	no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv	soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference	between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him	into downing bourbon	6936.789652222977
4130. choice	registered democrats in new york city this year have	the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for mayor and	other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization	3432.6743569065634
4131. in the central contest that for mayor they may have found	some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other	3473.843361030089
4132. mayor robert f wagner must as his opponents demand assume	responsibility for his performance in office	1257.5517544379684
4133. while all citizens	share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious	problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies	3894.1842205533458
4134. the	mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record	639.6454072414144
4135. state controller arthur levitt on the other hand cannot effectively	deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders	who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than	in the city's welfare	6180.391048691362
4136. they too have links with the city's	ills	167.12353868509723
4137. both men are known to be honest and public-spirited	392.43219260628047
4138. mayor	wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed	than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence	in his more protected state post	2843.5699582454154
4139. as mayor mr levitt	might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters	would like	2584.8015395291836
4140. his election on the other hand would unquestionably	strengthen the regulars	503.62158603149464
4141. mr wagner might or might	not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of	the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses	4817.341838697894
4142. these	are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected	to seek the independent vote	1741.2919018140226
4143. but his reelection would strengthen	the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him	1653.15248566675
4144. if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish	it nevertheless must be made	1405.9751578520538
4145. the vote still gives citizens a voice	in the operation of their government and their party	1891.3027470433954
4146. both mr k's have so far continued	to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos	1260.244636378437
4147. president	kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to	be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow	2823.4247680481403
4148. but at the same	time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the	fighting	1419.7051164717682
4149. and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless is	trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian	or thai seato forces	3695.360850056442
4150. for mr kennedy speaking	softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad	situation	1582.7685419087902
4151. the new president is in no position to start out his dealings	with moscow by issuing callable bluffs	2346.2516577884353
4152. he must show at the outset	that he means exactly what he says	785.114306596359
4153. in this case he has put	the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time	1891.711722899156
4154. at	his press conference mr kennedy said all we want in laos	is peace not war h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn	2734.9099309980384
4155. at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in	unprovocative but ready position	2127.1553716739572
4156. since laos is of no more purely	military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this	approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment	3212.014167932929
4157. but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in	laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course	that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog washington	in a tactical mess	6559.969022475225
4158. as wars go laos is an extremely	little one	263.75434921887364
4159. casualties have been running about a dozen men a day	566.4589073803656
4160. the	hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2000	tough viet minh guerrilla fighters	1421.27976786935
4161. but for the united states and	its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested	government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th'-wisp	terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners	5495.032565142575
4162. but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he	will not really get much enjoyment from watching this	braddock-against-the-indians	contest it will probably be the fact that seato	forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that moscow has something	to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations	with washington	5361.12957279363
4163. fortunately both the republicans and america's	chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos	aim of the president	2817.866953064606
4164. actually it would be more accurate to say that	the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british	policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining	table	3645.411128799979
4165. it is ironic that washington is having to struggle	so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable	3045.875428739243
4166. the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after	the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington backed the	rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma	3099.13182303238
4167. but	since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist	position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire	patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of	interested powers	6080.192475695053
4168. the road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof	laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain	1584.3280650867712
4169. but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the	laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority	now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that	country from the cold war had to be made	6912.090520526566
4170. the world awaits mr khrushchev's	choice of alternatives	166.00612049339372
4171. the senate's overwhelming vote to support locally controlled	educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower	house	2363.1196182512276
4172. twice previously the senate has approved measures backing	etv and the house has let them die	1261.0780317710974
4173. but this year prospects	may be better	140.32362953431277
4174. the house communications subcommittee is expected to	report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds	1877.090924839192
4175. this year's senate measure would provide each state and the	district of columbia with $1000000 to be used in support of private	state or municipal etv efforts	4304.772881097965
4176. the funds would be used	for equipment not for land buildings or operation	787.9898881398174
4177. the relatively	few communities that have educational stations have found them	of considerable value	1403.2442241558485
4178. but lacking money from commercial sponsors the	stations have had	difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service	1424.2337166694194
4179. other communities- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill-	have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial	cost of equipment	4072.961224075615
4180. sam rayburn was a good man	a good american and third a good democrat	943.5392468098604
4181. he was all	of these rolled into one sturdy figure; mr speaker mr sam	and mr democrat at one and the same time	3498.5308608016226
4182. the house was	his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative	then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which	he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second	most powerful man in washington	4470.435210721231
4183. mr rayburn was not an easy	man to classify or to label	960.9409188557029
4184. he was no flaming liberal yet the new	deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him	1581.1721395135778
4185. he was	not a rear-looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will	miss him as much as any	2353.6302608407736
4186. two of the vital qualities demanded	of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence	and that he keep his word	2590.090906388778
4187. sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with	him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once	given was not subject to retraction	3885.7615362889483
4188. it might be added that as he kept	his word so he expected that others keep theirs	1417.155876000698
4189. the demonstration	of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical	560.9435156631854
4190. his leadership	was not for audiences	43.452189797227604
4191. a growl a nod was usually enough	138.50701754151876
4192. when it	was not one of the great dramas of washington would be presented	942.8196870950053
4193. he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his	hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative	chatter would subside into silence	5168.524710540042
4194. he spoke briefly sensibly	to the point and without oratorical flourishes he made good plain	american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted	upon it	2958.2507283856075
4195. these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn	normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before	an issue reached its test on the house floor	4087.0848190957704
4196. he expected democrats	to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them	1250.6726674194435
4197. with	his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political	leader	1892.6659888658055
4198. he was of course in the house for a very long	time	642.3418897661087
4199. there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn	voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917	3032.080194301932
4200. to	almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the	existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house	2310.80365187737
4201. and it was the house he loved	141.69683719196962
4202. to be presiding officer of it was the	end of his desire and ambition	939.4606192241044
4203. the senate to him was not the upper	body and he corrected those who said he served under the	president	2828.1626277373352
4204. sound the roll of those	with whom he served and who preceded him in death	1094.2619220579973
4205. woodrow wilson	with whom he began his years in washington warren g harding	calvin coolidge fdr with whom he managed a social revolution	3497.5841086461464
4206. and those still with us herbert c hoover harry s truman	dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy	1581.0659361525459
4207. he was	a fighter for those of his own party	555.9663421408134
4208. mr truman has only to recall	the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan	he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would	have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there	4282.441221057894
4209. as it	was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration	1878.3548418561254
4210. with republican presidents he fought fair	43.43429198167889
4211. he was	his own man not an automatic obstructionist	391.4479873638807
4212. he kept his attacks	on republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game	he	was born to play	2024.562152253072
4213. under any name- mr speaker mr	democrat mr sam- he was a good man	1408.2620711480508
4214. thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the	cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent	death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends	3554.2127475626867
4215. in 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that	jungle	1191.6759090742723
4216. simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the	bodies and tossed the remains into the river	1266.6167154373918
4217. the excuse was offered	for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries	1647.4563908837117
4218. in other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central	government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause	of dissident katanga	2741.912568606188
4219. does this suggest that the congo	is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever	toward its goal of so making it	3908.808685737617
4220. to the contrary through the past	six	weeks violence has been piled upon violence	940.009383750135
4221. mass rapes troop mutinies	uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures	given no sanction by any political authority have become almost	daily occurrences	3708.7977684310003
4222. yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is	not the work of katanga	941.5762051195668
4223. it happens in the territory of the leopoldville	government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable	of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un	support gives it	4854.715689837007
4224. the main question raised by the incident is	how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo	problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in	present terms	3953.165231750052
4225. the probable answer is that it will do so just as long	as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african	nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting	ruin on central africa	6808.682453075482
4226. right now they are pushing	a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate	katanga	1732.8992565888486
4227. that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several	points of view	562.0177740488602
4228. the un army is too weak too demoralized for	the task	503.9940901448531
4229. further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it	is now garrisoned	1406.497501773549
4230. last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one	reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos	1430.7215150991028
4231. the congo	should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence	1176.1875593951545
4232. the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed	over wisdom	641.1690631596063
4233. it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because	it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism	2811.6578090594517
4234. but if	any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it	is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and	urge some new approach	3451.5135198323346
4235. otherwise un will march blindly on to	certain defeat	392.88771962079153
4236. a recent editorial discussing	a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific	co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized	on the grounds that it was not based on complete information	3543.5559552210943
4237. the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that	the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed	40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction	in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year	7125.929454413876
4238. our comment	was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that	sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such	an agreement	2849.4316454321697
4239. the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad	had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but	that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life	5004.367877773506
4240. additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad	gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need	2023.8142354450015
4241. also normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision	more or less academic	1419.0900370704226
4242. the situation with regard to the southern	pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable	to other situations in other industries	2329.2614984416223
4243. the solution reached in	the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally	included in a series of union demands	3265.4744897222113
4244. time was when the house of delegates	of the american bar association leaned to the common sense	side	1572.8980031990227
4245. but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of	the bar and when the lads met in st louis it was not to grumble	about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations	was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and	there	7103.7633515532125
4246. it was the brief writers decided man's best hope	for a peaceful and law abiding world	1273.0124797388921
4247. peace it's wonderful and	world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international	covenant extending it into space before the russians put	some claim jumper on the moon	4836.096096715818
4248. meanwhile in moscow khrushchev	was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build	a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt to knock	sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice	of surrendering west berlin to communism	5019.3047289160895
4249. a nuclear pacifier	of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger	than anything the united states has triggered experimentally- would	certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks khrushchev might	use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st	louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink	8287.118968120161
4250. while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed	an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in	the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide	3443.6273013502987
4251. fools	he bayed what do you think you are doing	568.2209921746618
4252. the	only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't	playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations but	perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this	feeble effort	4393.328178199748
4253. another evidence of the spreading rule of reason	was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american	plane by a demented algerian with a gun	4475.1095149855955
4254. the craft made the familiar	unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro	rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian	foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old ten o'clock	shadow	4118.789196029813
4255. the plane was sent back to the united states for	a change but castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable	recruit to the revolution	4289.4811891118625
4256. less respect for the legal	conventions was displayed by castro's right hand man che guevara	who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting	in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined	from the united states embassy at caracas venezuela	4288.990409364352
4257. the contents	were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand	to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium	3455.2542694985764
4258. perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing	american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration	can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own	incompetence in protecting american interests these things would	not happen	4474.905758061831
4259. the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion	mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not	symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious	khrushchev	5499.655148190982
4260. pass the iron rations please and light another	candle for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read	a bit of world law just to pass the time away	3328.8850298848506
4261. again	the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission	has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates	on grain as they had planned to do this month	5177.288601611928
4262. the request for	lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent	a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which	it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional	smaller car	4532.822032877241
4263. by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and	its	associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have	lost to truckers and barge lines	4821.38115157675
4264. the board's action shows	what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws	1411.0086433327688
4265. word of dag hammarskjold's death	in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe	2135.617419377544
4266. as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace and	his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously	2602.2980329383163
4267. it was	on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold	war issues	2350.1014319689525
4268. his firm hand will be desperately missed	93.7129703695379
4269. mr	hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace	561.7870589022683
4270. he had sought	talks with moise tshombe the secessionist president of congo's katanga	province where recent fighting had been bloody	1890.1284653749663
4271. he earnestly	urged a cease-fire	22.444938581359814
4272. the story of the fatal crash is not fully	known	375.7409161546844
4273. the un-chartered plane which was flying from the conference	city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun	bullets last weekend and was newly repaired	4282.659918584959
4274. whether this or	overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined	1095.6403770872669
4275. the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations'	most controversial leader	967.3393686073572
4276. he was controversial because he was uncompromising	for peace and freedom with justice	784.5478992653368
4277. he courageously defended	the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the	savage attacks of the communist bloc	3039.512990773579
4278. the congo in whose cause	he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs	1257.5833327802907
4279. his policies	had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war	and workable solutions were beginning to take shape	3035.945248282666
4280. when the recent	katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold despite	the danger flew to exert a calming influence	1741.4567186248987
4281. he gave his life	for his beliefs	140.4636439371794
4282. the un session scheduled for today	will meet under the cloud of his passing	944.367458905743
4283. it is a crucial session with	the world on the edge of momentous developments	1415.195150349315
4284. if the manner	of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication	the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason	and justice	3440.6582760769516
4285. that is the hope of mankind	65.2600589518283
4286. reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community	has long been one of greater miami's hardest tasks	1719.451699450408
4287. too	many have bogged down in bickering	139.842014680055
4288. even when public bodies arrived at	a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual	1257.0813343636964
4289. so	we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity	394.44392260969573
4290. all nine members of	the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody + company's	proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center	1338.4974032515577
4291. the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms	of its contract	1876.9067498358986
4292. if the indenture is accepted the authority will	proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue	1429.6288078914172
4293. then goodbody	will hand over a minimum of $15	392.5126723798291
4294. 5 million for developing the spacious	graves tract to house the center	645.5211717807458
4295. the next step awaits	approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade	county port authority	2602.3399753350413
4296. they allotted $500000 three years ago to	support interama until its own financing could be arranged	1264.9526668843635
4297. less than	half the sum has been spent since the interama board pinched pennies	during that period of painstaking negotiations	2817.5535601412266
4298. the balance is being	budgeted for the coming year	262.0067959115727
4299. unanimity on interama is not	surprising	65.54413306096725
4300. it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly	everyone is agreed	1099.268996827521
4301. the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim	of $8	752.5344561863102
4302. 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project	791.6871626772473
4303. county officials have cooperated consistently	22.151548842615746
4304. so have the people's	elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels	645.1870817581234
4305. interama	as it rises will be a living monument to greater miami's	ability	to get together on worthwhile enterprises	2599.480983381586
4306. a good one	progress or lack of it toward civil rights in	the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued	last week by the united states commission on civil rights	3559.3029004034966
4307. much happened in this field during the past 12 months	563.2782014135785
4308. each state	advisory committee documented its own activity	166.30209001001762
4309. some accounts are quite	lengthy but florida's is the shortest of all requiring only four	paragraphs	1887.4829292214467
4310. the established pattern of relative calm in the	field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this	group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south	floridians william d singer and john b turner of miami	4230.982574880153
4311. no complaints or charges have been filed during the past	year either verbally or written from any individual or group	2823.985109283622
4312. the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed	in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in	its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from	time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights	4624.368353742902
4313. problems	have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most	cases with understanding and restraint	2348.692927054274
4314. the progress reported by the	advisory committee is real	262.73615783671755
4315. while some think we move too fast and others	too slowly florida's record is a good one and stands out among	the 50	3496.9327890436534
4316. west germany will	face the crucial tests that lie ahead on berlin and unification with	a coalition government	1578.0448224494935
4317. this is the key fact emerging from sunday's	national election	563.1305961230881
4318. chancellor adenauer's christian democratic	party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough	to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957	2851.535544652582
4319. in	order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival	parties which gained strength	2825.34056642776
4320. inevitably this means some compromise	14.99503963332848
4321. the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired	391.1409416307752
4322. both	willy brandt's social democrats who gained 22 seats in the	new parliament and the free democrats who picked up 23 will insist	on that before they enter the government	3215.3120110177215
4323. moon-faced ludwig	erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership	long denied him	1661.282542077369
4324. if he becomes chancellor dr erhart would	make few changes	374.818438516052
4325. the wizard who fashioned west germany's astonishing	industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise	1644.8659812892777
4326. he is dedicated	to building the nation's strength and as are all west germans	to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany	2608.6782320269767
4327. what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the	voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result	3709.6398022442736
4328. if the party of adenauer and erhart with 45 per cent of the vote	approaches the party of willy brandt which won 36 per cent the result	would be a stiffening of the old resolve	3736.7269942856074
4329. west berlin's mayor	brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his	city and won votes by it	2795.3140249555067
4330. the free democrats	believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with	the soviet union and more dealings with the communist bloc	2335.3007933323383
4331. the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly	toward more firmness or more flexibility	2375.5121646087855
4332. it could go either	way since the gains for both points of view were about the same	1415.306123409895
4333. regardless of the decision two facts are clear	250.45970017056453
4334. west germany with	its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains	firm with the free nations	1579.5129695808162
4335. and the career of konrad adenauer	who upheld germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which	bismarck	began draws near the end	2808.5075294408334
4336. americans	are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing	and sometimes amusing	1259.1685035651285
4337. but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't	want to make a spectacle of himself	1869.3134328609897
4338. for instance so-called	conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting	in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took	root	2185.540378205824
4339. one specific example is a secret fraternity which	will coordinate anti-communist efforts	964.9564561576404
4340. the principle is commendable	but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get	gulled	1409.504803849337
4341. according to the chicago tribune news service	state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series	of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization	seeking his money and his name:  does it assail schools	and churches with blanket accusations	6804.608529429657
4342. does it attack other	traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges	637.1589347827901
4343. does it put the label of un-american or subversive on	everyone with whom it disagrees politically	1881.666430345934
4344. does it attempt	to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars	communism depression and other troubles of the world	2019.6434722137008
4345. does	it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone	calls and letter writing campaigns	2123.481236079457
4346. do its spokesmen	seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the	principles they purport to advocate	2015.7641240550238
4347. in some instances a seventh	question can be added:  does the organization show an	affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition	or preference to the american system	5004.392207233611
4348. if the would-be	joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists	who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic	apprehensions of americans in a troubled time	3649.9986195332044
4349. falling somewhere	in a category between einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult	to see but undeniably there nevertheless- is the tropical green	city of islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost	no residents limited access and an unlimited future	6438.759691266512
4350. the latter is	what concerns us all	92.79512941748794
4351. whatever land you can see here from the north	tip end of elliott key looking southward belongs to someone- people	who have title to the land	4109.9553488892525
4352. and what you can't see the land	underneath the water belongs to someone too	948.0025222790224
4353. the only	real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water	land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater	land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment	6101.334277132997
4354. in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developers	of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours	2597.7892486254086
4355. in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share	is protected	1183.1601505846131
4356. and until this protection is at least as concrete as	say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach	those who represent us all should agree to nothing	3646.9585503034787
4357. the reaction of certain city council members to	california's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing	2597.9442385005177
4358. we had assumed that at least this local legislative	body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making	the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available	to the public	3659.9174730866653
4359. in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes	collectively known as the brown act the legislature declares that	the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies	in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business	6323.553029420718
4360. it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and	that their deliberations be conducted openly	1878.5774046516694
4361. the people	of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve	them	1874.8337891731535
4362. the people in delegating authority do not give their public	servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and	what is not good for them to know	3444.8827557387694
4363. the full implementation of	these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of	the legislature	2362.0845018039595
4364. since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting	guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not	until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining	loopholes in the brown act	3761.9282220473506
4365. despite the lip service paid by	local governments the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted	by reservations and rationalizations	2591.472694765428
4366. when all else fails it	is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations	940.6773969199405
4367. we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one	of its principal aims	2362.3987018971816
4368. without public scrutiny the deliberations	of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily	1102.5766524341095
4369. but the	citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted	were as correct as they were expeditious	3040.089093345284
4370. if the dominican republic achieves	free democratic government it will be due in large part to the us	show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened	restoration of trujillo dictatorship	3550.718847801537
4371. outwardly ciudad	trujillo is calm	22.353666271878847
4372. none of the trujillo family remains	43.54474753754225
4373. mr	balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse	to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections	in the spring	4287.88687257876
4374. had us warships not appeared off	the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would	now be wracked by civil war	2321.1805228851426
4375. ultimately either the trujillos would	have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions	favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro	in cuba	4652.569420362312
4376. within the organization of american states	there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention	which was not without risk obviously	2152.5428552355543
4377. but there was no complaint from	the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo's waterfront	shouting vive yankees! more the us action was hailed	by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch as having saved	many lives and many troubles in the near future	6735.999494812619
4378. mr	balaguer's troubles are by no means over	167.7082883390848
4379. he will need the help	of all oas members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism	pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike	2818.4618662528887
4380. in cooperating toward	that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness	demonstrated by the united states	1574.9435837817537
4381. those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial	unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor	split in 1935	3860.3601241892393
4382. now as then it is a matter of jobs	261.35510610549875
4383. craft	unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance	957.6202408959301
4384. the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession	from the american federation of labor of its industrial union	members	2021.7178522861773
4385. that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american	federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations	3042.300555953273
4386. or that's what it looked like at the time	262.0807895716331
4387. but automation	and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition	for jobs	1421.0415286669502
4388. walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction	of the afl-cio says another two years of this squabbling	will be disastrous for all american labor	2580.3902288108598
4389. whether it could	be as disastrous for american labor as say jimmy hoffa of the	teamsters is a matter of conjecture	3048.081850204776
4390. but the jurisdictional disputes	that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for	labor	1260.8523842484124
4391. engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition	of national survival this country can have little patience with	labor's family feuds	4096.131046205013
4392. the concept of labor as a special class is	outmoded and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free	world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself	to survive	3969.086221760568
4393. the army navy and air	force among others may question secretary freeman's claim that	the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest	deterrent to the spread of communism	4842.360327982935
4394. but the secretary insists that	the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source	of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world	2870.008922647615
4395. mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on	a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america's capacity	to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or	even by the soviet's successes in space	6463.161981457097
4396. this shouldn't surprise	the secretary; american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses	for a long long time	1568.6336902978599
4397. in fact over the years the american	farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large	dollar	2363.7183905531124
4398. and thus far mr freeman has offered very little relief	376.7371423037955
4399. the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored	has been declared a billion dollar fiasco	1895.1233028038528
4400. in exchange for higher price	supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage	638.5466372237976
4401. but the	farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the	rows and pouring on the fertilizer	2133.1840309014938
4402. 1 billion	added to the deficit in the federal budget	376.5759424739364
4403. perhaps as mr freeman	says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also	swindling the american taxpayer	2580.7248251117676
4404. a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington	has been going over the state department and has reached some	predictable conclusions	2173.360112279689
4405. the department needs a clearer sense of	direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen	jackson says	3033.705548968662
4406. the subcommittee is not alone in questioning	the effectiveness of the department	638.4579930793572
4407. president kennedy has indicated	his dissatisfaction with its performance	390.61442606219094
4408. but those who would	revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the	resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures	suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes	3321.651700099754
4409. nor does sen	jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in	the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the	study of foreign policy	4661.920128141809
4410. this tends to create friction and confusion	and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and	initiative among his subordinates	2467.988572487269
4411. but competent observers believe	he is making progress particularly toward what sen jackson	lists as the primary need- a clearer understanding of where our	vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them	5786.717731749972
4412. the jackson report will provide some of the political support	mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel	engaged as sen jackson puts it in work that does not really	need doing	3940.451598851818
4413. mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jackson's	recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national	security problems be improved	3039.634469514853
4414. self-criticism is a rare but needed	commodity in congress	260.3789780475166
4415. forecasting	economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist	758.0585061744652
4416. but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he	be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment	trends	2452.072103136268
4417. james p mitchell when he was the head of the department	promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below	three million a couple of years ago	4486.76773782615
4418. he lost but settled for a cake	in the shape of a fedora	794.2709020512252
4419. his successor secretary goldberg	also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which	has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months	4854.431448424891
4420. no	betting man mr goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out	again by predicting the rate will go down this month	2179.427742660744
4421. he is basing	his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened	its stride- a new record high in personal income an increase	in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for	durable goods	6465.667236757354
4422. mr mitchell had an excuse for losing- the	steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated	1256.6993821613833
4423. mr goldberg	has less reason for missing	139.64981899687558
4424. the economy seems to be sailing along on	an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an	end so they can't be blamed in november	3219.591783840216
4425. the odds thus appear favorable	that the secretary's neck may be spared	955.0156137547767
4426. cambodia's chief of state who has been accused of	harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for	neighboring south viet nam and thailand insists he would be very	unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia	4059.4595564310416
4427. but so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is prince	sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel	2580.8342900925154
4428. i have to see the	facts is the way the prince puts it	791.2225388780558
4429. and from that point of vantage	he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western	posture	2580.260789813342
4430. prince sihanouk's powers of prognostication	some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the	courage of his convictions	2162.2435601985553
4431. commerce secretary hodges seems to have	been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington's economic	forecasters	2339.98165283816
4432. weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second	quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking	their heads in disagreement	2719.69253875125
4433. recently treasury secretary dillon and	labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges' appraisal	though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white	house	4472.777964136724
4434. and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the	economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped	sliding and that it should start going upward from this point	3351.039651360717
4435. he	is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump	1418.2964895275818
4436. the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail	sales	503.41224569832167
4437. february's volume was 1 per cent above january's for the	first pickup since last october although it's still 1	2578.6993532708047
4438. 5 per cent	off from february 1960	94.37209800944525
4439. corroborating mr hodges' figures	was the federal reserve board's report of the large sales increase	in the nation's department stores for the week ending march 4	4089.4304040501156
4440. in newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the	year-earlier level	1253.9465652716426
4441. of course some of the credit for the sale boost	must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter	comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960	5315.027514327149
4442. another optimistic	sign this one from the labor department was the report that	the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted	for the first time in the week ending feb 25	3438.605810828626
4443. initial claims	for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8100 in the week	ending march 4	2356.5000040507607
4444. mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook	that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes	2315.1989184946556
4445. well we can't have everything	22.121798280456595
4446. prosperity for the whole nation	is certainly preferred to a tax cut	646.2993487875723
4447. new jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to	the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles	of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that	remain	6182.069827181082
4448. now the stone harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction	for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends	far beyond our state	2478.2716106496864
4449. against the dramatic fight being waged	for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract	at stone harbor may seem unimportant	3656.989282595246
4450. but interior secretary udall	warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few	surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment	of all as public preserves	3747.28793072001
4451. the move for establishment	of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of cape cod from provincetown	to chatham is strengthened by president kennedy's interest	in that area	4456.968465044114
4452. but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape	is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the	recreation spot of people from all over the country	3462.0689354350275
4453. by comparison	stone harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable	for aside from the audubon society they are mostly the snowy	common and cattle egrets and the louisiana green little blue and	black-crowned herons who nest and feed there	6183.229027114373
4454. but there is hope for	conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the	kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its	park space	3232.152510906293
4455. the desirability of preserving such places as the	cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every	year	2605.488489042015
4456. public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is	growing	376.22990497370915
4457. but that heritage is shrinking even faster	141.03726941730147
4458. much of the glamor president kennedy's peace corps	may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent	shriver the head corpsman	2462.8359170126496
4459. anybody who is expecting a joyride	should according to mr shriver get off the train right now	2126.3790018672
4460. first of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling	505.61900975452966
4461. it will be a 16-hour training day	142.156485376778
4462. then off to a remote place in	an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living	conditions will be different	2038.7605381580222
4463. and the pay of course will be nil	250.0887293345689
4464. despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination	of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by	the response than anybody else	2597.576782616437
4465. the study of the st louis area's economic prospects prepared	for the construction industry joint conference confirms and	reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey	of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois	countryside	6236.589972500643
4466. st louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing	and in some places stagnant mid-continent region	1420.3389453612276
4467. slackened	regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the region's	relative lack of purchasing power	2121.5773106795136
4468. not all st louis industries	of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood	1253.798042107111
4469. but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding	effect on the metropolitan core	2606.148749258188
4470. the city has a stake in stimulating	growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern	illinois	1419.762514897232
4471. gov dalton's new commerce and industry	commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective	effort to attract new industry	3484.455341622705
4472. another	would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis president of	the university of missouri and provide for an impartial professional	analysis of missouri's economy	2854.0767935840877
4473. he says the state in order to	proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how	the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the	national economy	4994.051020193788
4474. the research center of the university's	school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake	the analysis dr ellis has been talking about	2470.9706971532223
4475. he and dean	john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at	a recent conference	2130.839763804068
4476. the university can make a valuable contribution	to the state's economic development through such a study	1257.315737806402
4477. in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically	depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth	2814.633102092814
4478. the carbondale	industrial development corp has obtained a $500000 loan	to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate	production that will provide 500 new jobs	3109.493887818245
4479. carbondale is in the	herrin-murphysboro-west	frankfort labor market where unemployment	has been substantially higher than the national average	2354.0045427549435
4480. the federal	program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri's depressed	areas and in the long run that will benefit st louis as	well	2604.685064848087
4481. politics-ridden st clair county in illinois presents	another piece of the problem of metropolitan development	1639.6711695568483
4482. more industrial	acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other	jurisdiction in the st louis area	1734.9186944122762
4483. the unstable political situation	there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side	1883.7358320778844
4484. and then there is st louis county where the democratic	leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning	of the important relationship between proper land use and economic	growth	3445.8057595661985
4485. st louis county under its present leadership also has	largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted	parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests	4668.347691712489
4486. some	plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st louis	county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more	jobs are lost	2598.0340601261814
4487. metropolitan st louis's relatively slow	rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business	civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi	4475.035907587642
4488. without	a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy there will	not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st	louis will slip into second-class status	3108.810244804384
4489. many of our very best friends are reformers	253.4474466100241
4490. still we must confess	that sometimes some of them go too far	639.6058119988755
4491. take for example the reformers	among new york city's democrats	563.9663176281064
4492. having whipped mr de	sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall	they have changed the name to chatham hall	2457.5013220492797
4493. even though headquarters	actually have been moved into the chatham building do they believe	that they can make the new name stick	3262.7986340554608
4494. granted that the tammany	name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political	shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to	their credit	3335.9931102734517
4495. but it is tradition rather than the record which balks	at the expunging of the tammany name	2120.708287440107
4496. after all it goes back to the	days in which sedition was not un-american the days in which the sons	of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force	and violence- the british government that is	3944.947224030818
4497. further do	our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent	to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo	3056.946994167956
4498. they will- when they	give up the donkey and the elephant	504.6022062771125
4499. instead of attempting the impossible	why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's	stripes are not black	2813.579767596685
4500. that might go over	2.968138827967933
4501. the	white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official	col mariano faget	from his preposterous position as interrogator	of cuban refugees for the immigration service	4655.781625271403
4502. the	faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds	166.431806627306
4503. the kennedy	administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have	nothing to do with associates of dictator batista	2587.6362151824806
4504. using a batista	man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic	forces which alone can effectively oppose castro	2031.7784778371054
4505. moreover	col faget's information on cuba was too outdated to be	useful in screening castro agents; the colonel fled to the	friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized	power	5307.233583551969
4506. and while he had headed batista's anti-communist	section	the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open	opponents who were alleged to be communists	2962.384723257962
4507. responsibility	for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing an	eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service	2849.3261724816603
4508. gen swing	has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the	prerogatives of his office	1570.7734584559435
4509. his official term expired last summer	65.26014405429171
4510. some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend	congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy	administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it	could get	3657.803222124397
4511. congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration	matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962	2119.3564834378126
4512. at that	point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen	swing	942.77409302823
4513. the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration	should not have to repeat	1882.7397142903108
4514. as	president dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from	the strife of partisan politics	1262.6986401835504
4515. as a former president however mr	eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during	a new york republican rally and generally missed his target	4089.1268253641565
4516. mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost	by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a	juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the	moon	3859.3464782514625
4517. nowhere did the speaker recognize	the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad	1882.8435227822688
4518. his	words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name	to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal	of international understanding	2981.239523927891
4519. the former president blithely	ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under	kennedy administration fiscal policies	2110.8624798027313
4520. it was the eisenhower administration	which produced the largest peacetime deficit	502.14485341009515
4521. finally	mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington	390.69071746450794
4522. this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower	first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional	weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the	picture too	3756.253514001991
4523. the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion	has hardly been compounded	1410.210488119509
4524. ex-presidents relieved of accountability	for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability	for their words	1259.913867569967
4525. some of former president truman's off-the-cuff	discourses have been in that vein	952.354071776608
4526. nobody can deny the right of former	chief executives to take part in politics but the american people	expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership	and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility	3938.2677470631634
4527. this is a matter	of respect for the presidency	391.94664978189286
4528. mr eisenhower's new york speech	does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship	1255.6082843742438
4529. the queen mary has long been a symbol of	speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high seas	2608.837341782368
4530. reports	that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was	to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us	2461.0764396898176
4531. but the cunard	line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has	decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least	4086.2653905487846
4532. a new queen with the prosaic title of q3 had been planned	for several years to replace the queen mary	1894.1373119398772
4533. the british government	concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding	industry had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling	$50400000 toward the $84000000 cost of a new 75000-ton passenger	liner	5798.861313503687
4534. since 1957 more and more trans-atlantic passengers	have been crossing by air	641.9797881704636
4535. economy class fares and charter flights	have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines	1641.8660090409248
4536. competition	from other steamship lines has cut cunard's share of sea passengers	from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked	drop of profits on the atlantic run	3346.501866920097
4537. the cunard line has	under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than	75000 tons	2127.0501189151796
4538. this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for	cruises during the lean winter months	1417.0791031372828
4539. also under consideration is	an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to	serve new york	2365.1831019296346
4540. the decline of the cunard line from its position	of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development	in the history of transportation	2312.2288238763176
4541. gen maxwell	taylor's statement in saigon that he is very much encouraged	about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam	turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement	that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to	bolster the vietnamese army	7023.608499038072
4542. gen taylor will report to president	kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet	nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east	he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese	military economic political and other resources	5024.774664516846
4543. there was	good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time	1641.0028863560012
4544. communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their	activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a	new crisis	2192.5533147287542
4545. south viet nam's rice surplus for next year- more than	300000 tons- may have been destroyed	1872.2102918987225
4546. the viet cong the communist	rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories	1096.9349057235388
4547. the	rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the	floods recede and the monsoon ends in november	3466.5490256709286
4548. nothing that	is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united	states soldiers for other than instructional missions	1867.3589458103743
4549. the indochina	struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when gen ridgway	estimated	it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win	a war the french were losing	5897.133623316297
4550. it is a war to stay out of today especially	in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently	does not want united states troops	2836.229799588752
4551. he may want additional technical	help and this should be forthcoming	754.9125128453105
4552. south viet nam has received	$1450000000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance	has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnson's	visit last may	3211.670687434687
4553. gen taylor the president's	special military adviser is a level-headed officer who is not likely	to succumb to propaganda or pressure	3056.7926905611207
4554. it is probable that his recommendations	will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to	involving the united states in an asian morass	2722.453483488565
4555. ambassador stevenson yesterday	described the u n's problem of electing a temporary	successor to the late dag hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the	institution has faced	2749.2760764662153
4556. if the decision goes wrong	it may be- as mr stevenson fears- the first step on the	slippery path downhill to a u n without operational responsibilities	and without effective meaning	5005.66592968011
4557. the integrity of the	office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as	the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization	but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions	from any government or any other authority external to	the organization	4911.212011786234
4558. in other words the secretary general is to be	a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one	2369.9688903045226
4559. he should be as dag hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the	world	796.6641034991017
4560. the charter does stipulate that due regard shall	be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical	basis as possible	3900.1413072795813
4561. the united states and its allies have	had no objection to this	641.1213336835416
4562. what they have objected to is the attempt	of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold's	death to turn the entire u n staff from the secretary down	into political agents of the respective countries from which they come	6695.814287149866
4563. the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic	origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly	around the nature of his relationship with them	3122.044800914743
4564. although	the united states and the u s s r have been arguing	whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important	element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the	manner in which these deputies are to do their work	7233.603257476022
4565. if any one	of them has any power to veto the secretary general's decisions	the nature of the organization will have changed	2180.6001856720177
4566. if they give him advice	when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction	the nature of the u n will not of necessity change	4640.436660511722
4567. the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction	of the security council and the general assembly the power	to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled	by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions	4312.993146418333
4568. this is the root issue for which the united states should stand	961.7229597165278
4569. we should not become confused or let our public become confused over	irrelevant questions of number or even of geography	1894.3338037290764
4570. what we must	have if the united nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan	an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject	to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's	ambition	6203.259226333999
4571. the new city charter	which should get a yes vote as question no 1 on nov 7 would	not make a good mayor out of a bad one	2991.497464311673
4572. there is no such magic	in man-made laws	248.0957352712193
4573. but it would greatly strengthen any mayor's executive	powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of	inaction in the board of estimate increase his budget-making authority	both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right	to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy	5253.217839450468
4574. lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate	and made	a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor	3058.438680921211
4575. thus	there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative	506.6552766941928
4576. the board is diminished in both respects while it retains control	over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment	of property and other trusteeship functions	4084.6205010869016
4577. the board will be able	to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the	mayor's veto; but the city council will now share fully this	budget-altering power	3102.418786782368
4578. overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes	will require concurrence by board and council and a two-thirds vote	2362.086603118834
4579. the controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions;	his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed	1410.0200838438582
4580. he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties which go to the finance	department	961.5761252836153
4581. on net balance in spite of controller gerosa's	opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the controller	will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government	than he has now	3774.0014364633985
4582. borough presidents while retaining	membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions	1411.6591193889794
4583. highways go to a new department of highways sewers to the department	of public works such street cleaning as borough presidents	now do to the sanitation department	2868.2319137028794
4584. some fiscal changes are important	22.11872095911571
4585. the expense budget	is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy	in fund transfers within a department	2468.2980066966747
4586. the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes	an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises;	but as a second-look safeguard each new project must undergo	a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds	6195.370084580975
4587. a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore	dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on	progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city	instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected	4475.176892341413
4588. this will	have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also	correct some injustices	1898.6512327758912
4589. enlargement of the city council	and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow	1253.861504543479
4590. the inter-american press association	which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape	horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in	eleven years	4821.151751345531
4591. the i a p a is a reflection of the problems	and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably	means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution	3454.311358049387
4592. as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime	more and more cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced	into exile	3682.602572545048
4593. the i a p a found itself driven from journalism	into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall	of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the	freedom it knew before batista's dictatorship began in 1952	4530.68638834528
4594. freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption	and social imbalances	1880.0289697629755
4595. in such conditions all freedoms are lost	92.79639078085484
4596. this in more diplomatic language is what adlai stevenson told the	newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states	government	3692.934475481057
4597. he felt able to end on a note of hope	374.12459586517474
4598. he sees evidence	of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with	its emphasis on social reforms	2583.8511732516636
4599. no group can contribute more to the	success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american	press association	2035.7944056833899
4600. the twenty-second	soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a	situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago	when this meeting was first announced	4456.506265798159
4601. according to the original program	premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin	this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending	upon individual or national politics- because of the bold program	for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt	4609.757054430953
4602. but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have	achieved utopia by 1980 the world is watching moscow today primarily	for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in	the immediate future	6214.542108897203
4603. the evident contradiction between the rosy	picture of russia's progress painted by the communist party's	program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier	khrushchev's berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that	the program may be severely altered	4377.625876752563
4604. whether it is or not the propaganda	impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted	at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated	5013.408904020703
4605. and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on	and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised	for 1980 they and their children must first survive	3837.7374196398764
4606. this	congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and	laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness	remove him from the scene in the next few years	5029.291859261234
4607. the widespread purge	that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist	leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who	will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect	will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening both	for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job	5469.665863297973
4608. dr james b conant has	earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer	1887.1209475934993
4609. his earlier reports considered the american public schools	basically sound and not in need of drastic change	1409.9825729227762
4610. now a close look	at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york	has shattered this optimism	3047.0068007217687
4611. dr conant has come away shocked	and angry	167.16208665958672
4612. his new book entitled slums and suburbs calls for	fast and drastic action to avert disaster	1876.8153849837586
4613. there is room for	disagreement concerning some of dr conant's specific views	639.6323266420278
4614. his	strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside	their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be	attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open	or permissive enrollment	5918.874619324282
4615. dr conant may underestimate the psychological	importance of even token equality	498.4333535835396
4616. his suggestion that	the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical	law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges	themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking	shape as a trend	6223.621816955834
4617. but these are side issues to a powerful	central theme	375.4209225781635
4618. that theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and	double-talk	250.64898658967417
4619. it labels the slums especially the negro slums as dead-end	streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters	1406.8521222798333
4620. the villains	of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters	and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike	3467.986347584198
4621. the facts	he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling	bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration	rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of	the color of their students	4309.320828291294
4622. a call for action before it	is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who	in his	previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme	measures	5162.602412110145
4623. these warnings must not be treated lightly	93.59489195848224
4624. dr conant's	conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nation's	gratitude	395.9935331801792
4625. he has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad;	but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward	report on the state of the public schools	3552.5468006456094
4626. a fascinating letter has just reached	this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail	2351.2142607059163
4627. he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now	going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives	in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses	or even zone numbers	4037.7970676207296
4628. in accordance with legislation passed	at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to	deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters speeches and other	literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district	6033.545372261171
4629. this means	an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining	of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal	deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk	mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis	4816.315677642324
4630. letter writing is a dying	art	65.62367182795802
4631. occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and	many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly	typewritten	2319.484897136081
4632. most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly	be called a letter	1405.4233384769434
4633. old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery	263.08194695092436
4634. she had	she said heard that the plant was closing	557.9901113105841
4635. it couldn't close she	said	14.803741737111531
4636. she had raised a calf grown it beef-fat	250.08345204585976
4637. she had with her own	work-weary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud	blossom and get ready to bear	2178.6004310558455
4638. she was ready to kill the beef dress	it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth	hash and stew against the winter	4465.507893821361
4639. she had done it last year and	the year before and the year before that and she and her people	were dependent upon these cans for food	2855.109797184409
4640. this did not happen in	counties of north georgia where the rivers run and make rich the	bottom land	2592.689750120845
4641. nor in south georgia where the summer sun shines warmly	and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields	2181.667868124848
4642. this happened in decatur dekalb county not 10 miles from the	heart of metropolitian atlanta	1648.47076094779
4643. and now the woman tired and	trembling came here to the dekalb county cannery	941.4209206933604
4644. is it so the	cannery is going to close	392.8061331049341
4645. o n moss 61 tall	grey as a possum canning plant chief since 1946 didn't know what	to say	1730.7373034477187
4646. he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this	summer	1403.918190645203
4647. he did say he was out of cans the no 3's but i requisitioned	22000	1094.9129960322443
4648. he said he had no 2's enough to last two	weeks more	959.080600961806
4649. threat of closing the cannery is a recent one	264.1900304912396
4650. a	three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles	o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed	2356.19202246839
4651. reason:	the cannery loses $3000 yearly	43.702422105011706
4652. but dekalb citizens those	who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed	to make any money	3027.3765001505412
4653. the cannery said mrs lewellyn	lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during	the war and rationing years of 1941 to handle the victory garden	produce is a service to the taxpayer	3772.7740585999795
4654. and one of the best services	available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant	grow vegetables and put them up	3887.850650465725
4655. it helps those people who help themselves	93.46455600320054
4656. the county though seems more interested in those	people who don't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and	line up for surplus food	4079.4977850733935
4657. a driver of a dairy truck who	begins work at 1 am finishes before breakfast then goes out and	grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family	of five asked what in the world will we do	4541.244558613221
4658. what	in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes	the tomatoes will any of us do	2596.349271262491
4659. moss a man who knows	how much the cannery helps the county doesn't believe it will close	1416.2368388873806
4660. but he is in the middle an employe of dekalb but on the side	of the people	2115.6935835256277
4661. the young married people; the old couples	94.83554218589043
4662. the	dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew	567.3581518465519
4663. don't	ask me if i think the cannery helps he said	503.65073825089473
4664. sir i know	the cannery helps	65.35294091610702
4665. most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard	641.2142525235533
4666. when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or	hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it	3269.37863452468
4667. there	is one thing i know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner	peace as long as the heart holds a grudge	2474.88784030628
4668. i know a man who held	resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades	1636.3823585987984
4669. several years	ago i was his pastor	93.55156894158979
4670. one night at the close of the evening service	he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his	heart to god	3685.6509030334296
4671. after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story	of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on	his land	2987.592701666628
4672. we tried to settle this dispute he said but	could never come to an agreement	1645.0485693207236
4673. i settled it tonight he continued	43.95125451422004
4674. i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has	been lifted off my heart i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven	my neighbor	4667.973393017101
4675. forgiveness is the door through which a	person must pass to enter the kingdom of god	1251.5040227353177
4676. you cannot wear the banner	of god and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in	your heart	2814.5711389473613
4677. henry van dyke said forgive and forget if you can;	but forgive anyway	794.2811543201317
4678. jesus made three things clear about	forgiveness	141.56401054372063
4679. we must first of all be willing to forgive others before	we can secure god's forgiveness	1256.3099761858052
4680. for if ye forgive men their	trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you: but if ye	forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive	your trespasses	4650.738311054893
4681. it will do no good to seek	god's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong	1720.6925206535518
4682. then jesus indicated that god's forgiveness is unlimited	250.44263373223802
4683. in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these	words forgive us our debts	1405.1481855978843
4684. when a person meets god's requirements	for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven	1417.5311018376142
4685. god's mercy	and patience will last forever	93.4308159783442
4686. forgiveness implies more than a person	wanting his past sins covered by god's love	1412.4345764133595
4687. it also implies	that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past	1573.4099769858187
4688. we want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for	god to direct the future	2817.436165631741
4689. finally we must be willing to forgive	others as many times as they sin against us	1256.4860844113264
4690. once peter asked	how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him	1640.1898553887943
4691. till	seven times	0.20041515
4692. jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven	249.06847628203278
4693. jesus not only taught forgiveness he	gave us an example of it on the cross	1095.5826436936609
4694. with all the energy of his broken	body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what	they do	2808.5161237534467
4695. she's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although	she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby she is getting	married	2864.3194062174603
4696. her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to	tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish	to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish	said	6434.624378157931
4697. for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn't	have made myself heard if i'd had the equivalent of the message	to garcia	2598.6710078291553
4698. but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been	through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young	female- six girls sprawled on one bed drinking cokes and giggling-	she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute	7129.754235595729
4699. how	do you know you love somebody enough to get married	500.8945490900149
4700. she asked	0.30041514999999996
4701. it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have	ever asked: how can you be sure	1413.4219822101675
4702. aren't you sure	0.30041514999999996
4703. i asked looking at her searchingly	43.23820332396694
4704. i wanted to grab her by the	arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life	is so long and marriage is so important	4665.2097863295885
4705. but if she were just having	a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten	her out of a really good marriage	2453.33669798301
4706. besides in all honesty i don't	know how you can be sure	962.5110227193018
4707. i don't know any secret recipe for certainty	166.26403094177095
4708. in the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love	the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships	are sometimes obscured	3699.3965140647874
4709. i knew of but one test and i threw it	out to her for what it was worth	1558.8005288432846
4710. does he ever bore you	22.472263332334386
4711. i asked	0.20041515
4712. bore me	0.30041514999999996
4713. she was shocked	0.20041515
4714. oh no-o! why	he's so darling and h   i mean i went on ruthlessly	when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders	of love is he interesting	4862.43317067901
4715. does he care about things that matter	to you	262.4248626043628
4716. can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island	for years and years and still find him fascinating	2835.281615236108
4717. because	honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in	every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded together	2020.9177118520802
4718. and if you bore each other then heaven help you	565.2333456958752
4719. she came	back the other day to reassure me	259.8038153236677
4720. she has studied and observed and	she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting	2589.8965850548266

4722. be friends with your mother-in-law	22.223386083186583
4723. jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothers-in-law make	good friends	499.53700282752254
4724. i do not know dr wilson sneed well	250.03366510003383
4725. but i was deeply moved	by his letter of resignation as rector of st luke's church	in atlanta	1572.3381341719466
4726. it was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many	in the clergy i suspect	2355.55073474282
4727. the pulpit is a lonely place	43.85758148754873
4728. who stops	to think of that	64.65469944110116
4729. imagine the searching and the prayer that	lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service	to this majestic church	2469.029040034952
4730. such a church needs vigor and vitality	in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments	he told his members	3694.5778791279713
4731. a minister should not stay beyond the	time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote h	for he becomes ordinary h	2329.8786165908355
4732. and so the young minister	resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he	told his parishioners when i did not gain from you far more than	i ever gave to you	5773.204481827209
4733. his very honest act called up the recent	talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said:	i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love	and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way: and	it is unworthy to think of self	5260.230274169413
4734. but oh how i do sometimes need just	a moment of rest and peace in myself	1888.360503074382
4735. a man who gives	himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself	a life of giving	2029.5902348230386
4736. he does not expect to get great riches or he would	not have chosen to answer the call to preach	2811.2425640154556
4737. the good ones are not	motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they	would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity	3201.3735926974655
4738. theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards	250.74008061623914
4739. yet we who	lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation	of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice	as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is	in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul	5201.762731180037
4740. we press	him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions	with his word and god's	2810.936265749019
4741. we do not defeat the good ones	with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them	to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance	and a few bucks a week american cash	4019.5056216637036
4742. if we break the minister	to our bit we are buying back our own sins	1650.2113468655866
4743. if he won't break we	add to the stress he bears	500.8155976716027
4744. and a minister of all men is most	conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly	humanity is heir to	3692.384538848949
4745. we expect him to be noble and to make us so-	yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be	2585.6631421648476
4746. we expect bestowal of god's love through him	250.51681543130698
4747. but how little love	we give him	94.59444988070081
4748. the church truly is not a rest home for saints but a	hospital for sinners	1651.8008203021486
4749. yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency	room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who	ministered to us is a human being who suffers too	3431.427241367988
4750. mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each	summer at loon lake	1413.4583497133833
4751. the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around	it only emphasized the pleasure	792.5168268922871
4752. the evening was not always	spent in the same way	558.4576448115134
4753. this year on a night cool with the front of september	moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers	were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod	3216.977415331762
4754. the little cottage	was bursting with people of all ages	554.8013096148072
4755. in the midst of it all	mr podger came out on the pod porch alone	1096.9634685819149
4756. he had that day	attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize	1906.3976510453717
4757. the prize was an old-fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross-top	pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging	1732.629557254236
4758. mrs podger	had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for	it and there it was slung in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze	rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement	5632.845636150736
4759. mr	podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two	slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it	2730.266281115442
4760. he closed	his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly	over him	1651.8965169452708
4761. suddenly one young voice rose above the others	167.26331072904628
4762. but	it said do you always know when you're happy	565.7358357185695
4763. the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question	stayed in mr podger's mind	1579.4987108354455
4764. here in the cool autumn-touched	evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly	contented and at peace	3066.7192823866267
4765. it had begun with the blue jay	feather	168.24677593606995
4766. walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had	seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight	3058.4588688138747
4767. the winging	spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood	788.933299123885
4768. the	small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet	1645.546297815473
4769. all	day long mr podger who was a straw-hat man in the summer had	worn	the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield	2465.4197323736544
4770. would a blue	feather in a man's hat make him happy all day	1191.4092434765446
4771. hardly	0.20041515
4772. but it	was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning	sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by	the lake	4835.276616290097
4773. then since the auction was being held nearby he had	walked to it	788.7605475067506
4774. and there on the way had been the box turtle that	slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bent for	reasons best known to itself on crossing the road	4475.053069557578
4775. it was doing very	well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable	singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching	in the shape of a flashy little sports car	3758.1634947464495
4776. would the driver see	the turtle	65.6691364853252
4777. would he take pains to avoid it	93.22106289470409
4778. mr podger	took no chances	22.337351758782347
4779. taking off his hat and signaling the driver with	it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle	and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking	suddenness	3460.0822724408454
4780. the turtle immediately withdrew into its private	council room to study the phenomenon	1198.0404455124233
4781. but mr podger and the	driver of the sports car waved at each other	946.910413013548
4782. here in the cool darkness	mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still	see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the	friendly grin on the young sun-browned face as the driver looked back	over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight	7763.566168306728
4783. where was the driver now	14.885410646129106
4784. what was he doing	4.455164272660265
4785. and the turtle	0.20041515
4786. mr podger smiled	0.30041514999999996
4787. for a few brief minutes they had all been	part of one little drama	937.0187962914727
4788. the three would never meet again but for	some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember	the incident	3274.858224164121
4789. then there had been the auction itself	94.41740018446188
4790. mr	podger heard again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices	of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested	in mr podger's hammock purchase	4992.8891457187065
4791. i like them things	too he had said	167.6373181521186
4792. we got one at home	22.18848992096421
4793. you know what	0.20041515
4794. if	you're lyin' out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool-	you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-	and wrap 'em right over you	5200.896050775891
4795. i do it lots o' times- i like to	lie in a hammock at night by myself when it's all quiet	2027.340604365302
4796. h the	wind moves it a little bit- you know h	756.8874250500202
4797. mr podger	had	thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice	940.1648532118085
4798. as he pulled	the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon mr podger	saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that	the boy too was lying in a cool fringed-wrapped quiet	5779.9756649474475
4799. alacrity	the podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly	against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up	2179.7830453142883
4800. she remarked that	she found the night wind a little chilly and mr podger took her	inside the fringe	2604.0049741262687
4801. soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree	crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod	1730.2816731259034
4802. mr	podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen	door opened and pam burst out	3043.4900620577505
4803. it's	getting so chilly we've lighted a fire and we're going to tell	a round robin story- a nice scary one	2039.8014582716005
4804. we need you to start it	65.04138042051285
4805. why	are you out here all by yourself	166.2577983412412
4806. aren't you happy	0.30041514999999996
4807. mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking alacrity under	his arm to bring her in by the fire	1723.5014491781462
4808. of course i am he said	64.8645186666604
4809. never happier in my life	14.817828135776855
4810. i just came out here to know it	248.95267776330917
4811. as the south begins another school year national and even	world	attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial	equality in the public schools	2744.149710071202
4812. desegregation is beginning in	two more important southern cities- dallas and atlanta	963.5585059235549
4813. in each	city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public	opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment	2321.2252491118056
4814. these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully	392.4641876456818
4815. the programs do not take sides on the issue itself	372.52370452374896
4816. they point	out simply that it is the law of the land	961.0042853195557
4817. the two	cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up	as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes	of desegregation	3099.8357962007626
4818. even better they have the examples of nashville	and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs	2376.2255443322288
4819. in each case there was an initial act of violence	373.85018438527607
4820. in nashville a	school was dynamited	64.89505555521609
4821. in houston there were a few incidents of friction	between whites and negroes none of which were serious	1560.731636710378
4822. in	each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government	halted the threats of more serious incidents	2832.7434147042395
4823. the nashville	plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable	and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south	2612.4673134129534
4824. it is a stair-step plan in which desegregation begins in	the first grade	1190.146708588601
4825. each year another grade is added to the process until	finally all 12 grades are integrated	1257.8469697547375
4826. the schedules are flexible	so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant	or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why	not now	5190.8192155845145
4827. the program has worked well in both nashville and	houston	376.17400869242124
4828. it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools	selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by	white parents	3703.387249601505
4829. another attempt will be made this year in new orleans	to resume the program	940.7801201371374
4830. generally throughout the south	there is a	growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every	step of desegregation is met	3279.754806771981
4831. perhaps the most eloquent move	toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas	945.1664598135725
4832. during the summer	negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants	and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments	2106.338145011395
4833. it was part	of a citywide move toward full integration	373.4150042247609
4834. so successful has	been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that	further extensions are expected in the next few months	3679.812658304813
4835. hotels for	example are ready to let down the bars	374.59800525184926
4836. already at least one hotel	has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis	1420.8055676305605
4837. several conventions	have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated	basis	937.6986406291757
4838. this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions	which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed	against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods	of dallas	5318.147522706019
4839. it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude	which appears to be spreading all across the south	1572.8582923422905
4840. southern	whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence	to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights	3265.175407678312
4841. they insist	they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama	when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination	in local bus depots	2979.500688167659
4842. all across the south there are signs	that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves	would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant	attitude toward it	5322.019631087876
4843. there are many causes for this change	93.5859657901901
4844. one	of the most important is economic	140.66372145026713
4845. business leaders are aware now	that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence	939.9070331529313
4846. they are putting	strong pressure on their police departments to keep order	962.6205837702182
4847. in the	past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way	786.6440231130375
4848. and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of	co-operation	has sprung up	1889.8526921387934
4849. this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites	to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation	1255.0540472539792
4850. they	realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will	not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and	otherwise	3470.4926857025957
4851. since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a	few months ago i've been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship	2179.39397977172
4852. played mostly on the freeways around los angeles it goes like	this:   a driver cruising easily at 70 mph in lane	a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead	5160.262585959123
4853. traffic	in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes	a tentative fender into lane b which is heavily populated by cars	also moving at 70 mph	3347.7018626652803
4854. the adjacent driver in lane	b has three choices open to him	964.5211050343839
4855. he can point his car resolutely	at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane	a; slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;	or alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the	first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating	sport of the whole affair	5176.499179510457
4856. the really remarkable thing to	me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down	and permit the invading car free access	3492.4864747652705
4857. whether or not this is done	out of enlightened self-preservation i don't know	787.6503312064638
4858. but it is done	consistently and i'm both surprised and impressed	755.1919874252181
4859. this	could never happen in my native chicago	165.78343922703462
4860. there such soggy acquiesence	would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood	1645.7996839109521
4861. in	chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor	in an effort to force the other car back	2470.995864251995
4862. failing this he would pull	alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly	1651.374549308049
4863. this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however	does an injustice to southern california drivers	1253.1356832627118
4864. at the risk	of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company i would	like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype	3262.054237691331
4865. after three months	of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are	considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i've	ever encountered	2726.5335175539926
4866. during one recent day of driving about los	angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers	stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible	side street	5576.497762592584
4867. an out-of-town writer came up to paul	richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball	club would be improved this year	2596.509739824588
4868. now richards of course is	known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go	1427.6659616296586
4869. he can often make the	complex ridiculously simple and vice versa	499.217548300025
4870. this happened to be	vice versa but even so the answer	was a masterpiece	1413.6682406007465
4871. it's a whole lot easier he said	to increase the population of nevada than it is to increase the	population of new york city	2439.3940835195713
4872. and with that he walked off to give	instruction to a rookie pitcher	1185.860569165862
4873. that is undoubtedly a hell	of a quote said the writer scratching his head	947.2501805324861
4874. now if i	can just figure out what he's talking about i'll use it	1406.9147119998665
4875. spots open	this was just richard's way of saying that last	year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open	2445.4657125982353
4876. some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two	spots left and right field are really up for grabs	3257.554421458378
4877. it should	be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots	that were open last year but so far it hasn't worked that way	3083.340991930031
4878. this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this	year is an interesting one	2147.3467761578913
4879. you'd never guess it from the way they've	played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some	around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the	pennant in 1961	3852.2222643285904
4880. obviously if this club is going to move from	second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement	someplace	3476.06246282215
4881. where can that improvement possibly come from	94.64711611349387
4882. you certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than	it did last year	1639.8559813047418
4883. brooks robinson is great	and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he	did in 1960	1879.1545889004403
4884. you can't expect it though	22.213722883228847
4885. robby's performance last	year was tremendous	43.41784942221666
4886. it's the same with ron hansen and	jim gentile	391.95270846935585
4887. if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no	complaint	1096.3452134794222
4888. they shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden	747.9400748801856
4889. hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might	very well set him back	1260.7960879211469
4890. he got off to an exceptional start last season	and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it	2129.4641294631715
4891. there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching	to him last year	1099.8684764889128
4892. they don't expect to stop him just slow him	down some with the bat	1419.0272224763507
4893. he'll still be a top player they concede	because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him	2036.201748913015
4894. but	they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production	391.8052501199161
4895. might move up	gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs	792.7654112961818
4896. i have a hunch marv breeding might move	up a notch	753.8319779634478
4897. but even so he had a good year in 1960 and won't do	too much better	1263.3936609677753
4898. so all in all the infield can't be expected	to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second	to first	3268.835145296077
4899. and the pitching will also have trouble doing better	262.29616036805345
4900. richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and	experience last season	1635.3162724435338
4901. where then can we look for improvement	93.97564217069787
4902. from triandos brandt and walker answers richards	140.47502636671612
4903. they're the ones we can expect to do better	261.84768824348487
4904. the	man is right and at this time indications are that these three are	ready for better seasons	2349.9047354743743
4905. triandos hasn't proved it yet but	he says he's convinced his thumb is all right	1093.8741818643064
4906. he jammed it this	spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasn't bothered	him	2836.311241846654
4907. if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years	the club will have to be better off offensively	2191.5996180768225
4908. i'm still	not convinced though i'll have to see more of him before predicting	that big year for him	2592.1260301099765
4909. hank foiles backed up by frank house	who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second	line catching than the birds had all last year but gus is still	that big man you need when you start talking pennant	4453.294838661544
4910. to me	brandt	looks as though he could be in for a fine year	1419.8146916933485
4911. he hasn't played	too much because richards has been working on him furiously in batting	practice	1256.4204290477824
4912. he's hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and	his whole attitude is improved over this time last year	2816.0715400349686
4913. when	he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win	the national league pennant and he was joining what seemed to be	a second division american league club	3530.8733915059065
4914. he was down hard to talk	to	and far too nonchalant on the field	1413.466144865526
4915. as of now that all seems behind	him	165.49313572187788
4916. he's been entirely different all spring	64.7756923393711
4917. and walker	looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year	935.9665757643394
4918. let	him bounce back and he could really set up the staff	969.3846335007833
4919. so	if the orioles are to improve brandt triandos and walker will have	to do it	1254.377826759127
4920. so far the platoons on left and right fielders don't	seem capable of carrying the load	1881.0800931047609
4921. of course this isn't	taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york	city but it's the way things look from here at this point	2734.0853046612833
4922. is the mother of an autistic child at fault	389.6958343858235
4923. child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self	639.0949875385503
4924. he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects-	did his	mother make him this way	2806.039918688021
4925. some people believe she did	14.753568664786178
4926. we believe that autism like so many other conditions	of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn	2601.49350560947
4927. a mother	can help a child adapt to his difficulties	375.4804749309731
4928. sometimes she	can- to a large extent- help him overcome them	751.3803335930697
4929. but we don't think	she creates them	93.66259080132329
4930. we don't think she can make her child defective	emotionally disturbed or autistic	1176.3480246437723
4931. the mother of a difficult	child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing	her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem	3348.1612509057873
4932. since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written	for the layman we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments	3498.411175168328
4933. she wrote:	as the mother of an autistic	child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything	i have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he	first	plays with a new toy	3860.063787014081
4934. he wants me to do everything for him	250.46965886209045
4935. you	don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of	something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats	them	2445.3147931230005
4936. but i do and my psychiatrist does too	252.3483989726899
4937. i know that my	son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give	full control or direction	1877.717657201616
4938. one thing i notice which i	have seldom heard mentioned	558.1216216378364
4939. this is that autistic people don't enjoy	physical contact with others- for instance my children and i	1421.4275914367963
4940. when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is	as straight and stiff as a board	3499.1506408327405
4941. he pushes and straightens himself	as if he can't stand the feeling of being held	1098.1321324646467
4942. physical contact is	uncomforatble for him!   this mother is quite correct	756.0521912900088
4943. as	a rule the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others	644.5946902762504
4944. parents have to find other ways of comforting him	390.83543051360743
4945. for the young	child this may be no more than providing food light or movement	1099.3063825215982
4946. as	he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object		806.0752285277111
4947. or certain words or rituals that child and	adult go through may do the trick	1098.1565382029562
4948. the answer is different for each autistic	child but for most there is an answer	1636.158730936921
4949. only ingenuity will uncover	it	14.721927063001086
4950. dear doctors: we learned this	year that our older son daniel is autistic	1181.648438136142
4951. we did not accept the	diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to	944.428998331155
4952. fortunately there	is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group	of normal children	2605.7198478540895
4953. i try to treat daniel as if he were normal	though of course i realize he is far from that at present	2178.44543486183
4954. what	i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible	2124.9265910974896
4955. i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible	508.39557316169277
4956. what is your experience with autistic children	140.41308050128734
4957. how do they	turn out later	42.90075188182538
4958. many autistic children grow up to lead	relatively normal lives	563.5009606162479
4959. certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth	in communication with other people but many adjust to school even	college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood	2999.4521417474602
4960. use	- a first grader colors pictures one solid color	everything- sky grass boy wagon etc	966.2628766743741
4961. when different colors	are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green	etc	1425.8190275474747
4962. the other children in the class use this same coloring	book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color	3261.7976252741455
4963. should	i show my daughter how things should be colored	374.4037177136272
4964. she is an aggressive	nervous child	65.46876268694669
4965. is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help	her outgrow these traits	641.2876499341097
4966. - her choice of one color	means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having	reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects	3037.058516232078
4967. this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature	for the first grade	1407.5480822446782
4968. no coloring isn't exactly something	you teach a child	395.448469844515
4969. you sometimes give them a little demonstration	a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines	1415.9207725981091
4970. but	most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only	a very little demonstration	2593.842685668889
4971. seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest	in an old art: embroidery	1104.462012707656
4972. possibly responsible for this is the incoming	trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to	replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed	4281.1936046440505
4973. just as	a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme	so may some of the newest versions of embroidery	2446.0699296151643
4974. one such	in fact is a rug	140.68159736165387
4975. though not actually crewel embroidery it has	that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze	and gold and a sauterne background	2462.2201176455587
4976. the twirled stylized design of	winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns	used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in	england	4079.9830962469714
4977. traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing	more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available	in this country	2449.5593429628593
4978. the work is executed in england and	can be worked in any desired design and color	1872.8391657847674
4979. among some recent	imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on	which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens	and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color	3926.1418302843617
4980. for a particularly fabulous room which houses	a collection of fine english chippendale furniture fabric wall panels	were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this	revered eighteenth century period	4817.734127994738
4981. since the work is done by hand	the only limitation it is said is that of human conception	1568.3796995901491
4982. modern embroidered panels framed and meant to be hung on the	wall are another aspect of this trend	2337.8390903553877
4983. these have never gone out of	style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and	there in shops which specialize in handicrafts	2574.4653042237887
4984. an amateur decorator	might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by	picking up her living room color scheme add a decorative do-it-yourself	note to the room	5147.777165213304
4985. california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962	model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling	in a thousand district headquarters party clubrooms and workers'	backyards	3326.3599721634637
4986. they seem darned proud of it	64.88315802328245
4987. and they're	confident that the gop currently assailed by dissensions	within the ranks will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood	of this grassroots-fueled machine	2860.2633585082194
4988. their meeting at san	francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california	democratic council directorate	2134.5831444408227
4989. but it will include 200-odd officeholders	organization leaders and interested party people	641.9955521031642
4990. out of this session may come: - plans for a dramatic	broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist	top-drawer democrats from all over the country	3213.3692236913926
4991. blueprints	for doubling the cdc's present 55000 enrollment	167.35900737226302
4992. arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in	fresno next jan 26-28	954.0782781236672
4993. and proposals for a whole series	of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new congressional	districts	1403.6219682116775
4994. at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox	39-year-old amateur politico thomas b carvey jr	whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft's moon	missiles	4106.618446720926
4995. he's approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering	fashion	261.42731725807266
4996. viewed from afar the cdc looks like	a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out	into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence	into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so	6055.665474413732
4997. much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every	volunteer democratic organization of any consequence belongs to	the cdc	2034.0923557104707
4998. moreover the entire state democratic hierarchy	from gov brown on down to the county chairmen also participates	in this huge operation	3055.4399875479203
4999. contrarily republican volunteers	go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication	that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate	except in the most loose-knit fashion	3341.4982891979794
5000. carvey believes that	reapportionment	which left many democratic clubs split by these new district	boundaries actually will increase cdc membership	2816.56964980861
5001. where	only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth	644.2230616024437
5002. biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up cdc	units in rock-ribbed democratic territory	1414.5707331571605
5003. paradoxically the council	is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's	favor strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly	even basis	2871.07973463263
5004. like most democratic spokesmen carvey predicts	1962 will be a tremendously partisan year	1188.1612859038594
5005. hence the attention	they're lavishing on the cdc	168.73837126991134
5006. in all probability the	council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for	congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary	favorites	4501.997900116579
5007. this bodes heated contests in several districts where	claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don't	see eye-to-eye with the cdc	2460.240552281542
5008. naturally the statewide	races will provide the major test for the expanding council	1188.5212489448359
5009. shunted	aside by the rampant organizers for john f kennedy last	year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential	campaign the cdc plainly intends to provide the party's	campaign muscle in 1962	3858.1578144943187
5010. there is evidence that it will be happily received	by gov brown and the other constitutional incumbents	2112.805578753441
5011. carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown's	most formidable foe with ex-gov knight a close second	1730.3316855686983
5012. but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don't worry	him very much	1178.5623194533764
5013. in his cdc work carvey has the close-in	support and advice of one of california's shrewdest political strategists:	former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren	who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty gen	stanley mosk	3954.561757094639
5014. that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren	note: we've	just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment	organizing convention wednesday night in south	pasadena's war memorial bldg which graphically illustrates the	cdc's broad appeal	6348.930674008054
5015. state sen dick richards will keynote;	state and county	committeemen cdc directors and representatives	members of 16 area clubs and all residents have been invited	2602.573040557154
5016. this is going to be a language lesson and you can master it in	a few minutes	2121.4725383057535
5017. it is a short course in communese	93.79311772864078
5018. it works	with english russian german hungarian or almost any other foreign	tongue	1179.2507513277797
5019. once you learn how to translate communese much of each	day's deluge of news will become clearer	1409.0853911557986
5020. at least i have found it	so	140.40621848114785
5021. for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated	dr freud communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably	impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves	2979.4102004082133
5022. they	accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves	are most guilty	1633.213891778516
5023. president kennedy's latest warning to the	communist world that the united states will build up its military	strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly	reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the	iron curtain	4305.505079970403
5024. then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces	with striking consistency	970.1463755032034
5025. now listen closely:	moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england:	president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals	to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat as part of	the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism	4545.532852813967
5026. evidently	the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred	up in the west have been planned long in advance	3056.1407632581077
5027. the west berlin	crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the	united states to justify its arms drive	2182.984887818646
5028. the soviet news	agency tass datelined from new york in english to europe:	president kennedy's enlargement of the american military	program was welcomed on wall street as a stimulus to the american	munitions industry	5485.204058979237
5029. when the stock exchange opened this morning	many dealers were quick to purchase shares in douglas lockheed and	united aircraft and prices rose substantially	2456.683323626926
5030. over 4 million shares	were sold the highest figures since early june	957.3430320316423
5031. tass datelined los angeles in english to europe:	former vice president nixon came out in support of	president kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race	2724.13990313346
5032. he also	demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international	tension: specifically to crush the cuban revolution resume	nuclear testing resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful	seat in the united nations and postpone non-military programs at	home	6425.258824590621
5033. tass from moscow in english to europe:	the american press clamored for many days promising president	kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems	confronting the united states	3340.1591602746835
5034. in fact the world heard nothing	but sabre-rattling the same exercises which proved futile for the	predecessors of the current president	3040.42689116043
5035. if there were no west berlin	problem imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping	up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems	besetting the united states and its nato partners	3959.9239003906887
5036. washington	apparently decided to use an old formula by injecting large	military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the us economy	after a prolonged slump	4096.827063630724
5037. and now for communist	listeners and readers:   moscow radio in russian to the ussr:	the us president has shown once again that	the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis	to justify the armaments race	4054.839637014844
5038. as was to be expected kennedy's latest	speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn	where officials of the west german government praised it	4088.457711674562
5039. moscow novosti article in russian datelined london:	us pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status	of west berlin has reached its apogee	2597.2805501619628
5040. british common sense is	proverbial	22.32608871586619
5041. the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate	ordinary britons shows that this british common sense is unwilling to	pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures	3324.067507753847
5042. east berlin radio in german to germany:	a better position for negotiations is the real point	of this speech	2583.384846358187
5043. kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west	berlin neither conventional nor nuclear and negotiations will come	as certainly as the peace treaty	2624.3051620743777
5044. whenever some washington circles	were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always	succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn	4474.108950188342
5045. in kennedy's speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless	ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president's	advisers and the political and economic forces behind them	3123.680899353363
5046. well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war	over west berlin	1654.979060292538
5047. moscow tass in russian datelined	sochi:   chairman khrushchev received the us president's	disarmament adviser john mccloy	1257.2925926250261
5048. their conversation	and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere	751.5436898281883
5049. now	to translate from the communese this means:   the west berlin	crisis is really an east berlin crisis	1594.5765482351876
5050. the crisis	was artificially stirred up by the kremlin and the	red army	1191.423062799284
5051. the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr	which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power and try to end	the permanent recession in russian living standards	2975.763046134368
5052. chairman	khrushchev in order to cure	his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position	1643.5308066076796
5053. his advisers	in the politburo are engaged in a great struggle	of opinions so he is not always consistent	1738.4575390863895
5054. the soviet union	will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over berlin	and neither will its warsaw pact allies	3073.6592497532138
5055. the west has no intention	of attacking russia	167.30093625411152

5059. the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c atkinson	and charles alexander who had just taken over franklin's	old paper desired a more distinctive name	2873.069285083916
5060. when founded by franklin	the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name	its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually	contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays	5765.97788164421
5061. in the	middle of the century with a circulation of 90000 the post was one	of the most popular weeklies in the country	2330.6890776445202
5062. but during the second half	of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus	h k curtis purchased it- paper type and all-	for $1000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and	initialed miscellany and with only some 2000 subscribers	7223.889280366956
5063. little	more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the	franklin tradition the saturday evening post was slow to revive	2185.327274123956

5116. the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being	celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament	the first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new	translation of the scriptures into contemporary english	6213.15372242602
5117. since	it was issued in the spring of 1611 the king james version has	been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations	of the bible	3108.081459508196
5118. however biblical scholars frequently attested	to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered	and scholarship advanced	2108.342955113766
5119. this resulted in revisions of the king	james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in	1901 as the american standard version	2471.6715634650545
5120. then in 1937 america's	international council of religious education authorized a new revision	in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages	3699.4396413963514
5121. undertaken by 32 american scholars under the chairmanship	of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university	divinity school their studies resulted in the publishing of the	revised standard version 1946-52	3556.0592855988843
5122. the new english	bible	has not been planned to rival or replace the king james	version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible	to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship	6341.299927584151
5123. time of course will testify whether the new version will have	achieved its purpose	943.7506216893468
5124. bible reading even more so than good classical	music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition	1885.358105201639
5125. if this	new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout	the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james	version	2880.647195061222
5126. however an initial perusal and comparison of some	of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to	speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars	4984.8996998531475
5127. one is	impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation	into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of	the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary	language than in the frequently	archaic words and phrases of the	king james	4971.769894636919
5128. for example in the third chapter of matthew verses	13-16 describing the baptism of jesus the 1611 version reads:	then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john	to be baptized of him	5328.650343311945
5129. but john forbad him saying i have	need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me	1559.3362152515406
5130. and	jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now: for thus it	becometh us to fulfill all righteousness	3033.383965998705
5131. and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the	water: and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit	of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him	3866.174620597377
5132. meaning	certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not	familiar with biblical teachings in the new english bible which reads:	then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee and he came	to john to be baptized by him	6185.976177253129
5133. john tried to dissuade him	14.855189737799236
5134. 'do you	come to me'	21.99446924962611
5135. he said; 'i need rather to be baptized by you'	372.5755652169081
5136. jesus replied 'let it be so for the present; we do well to	conform this way with all that god requires'	3030.4399764852205
5137. john then allowed him	to come	43.54763976813395
5138. to illustrate the first blessing	in the king james bible reads: blessed are the poor in	spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven	2468.7245637368055
5139. the new version	states: how blest are those who know that they are poor; the	kingdom of heaven is theirs	2806.3434059634446
5140. some of the poetic cadence of	the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone	with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the	meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar	4228.654231869822
5141. to a novice	that is significant	64.96836312096168
5142. in the second and third	chapters of revelation the new version retains however the old phrase	angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously	interpreted as meaning bishop	3103.371405744219
5143. this is not contemporary english	22.2537875272267
5144. contemporary	for the most part however the new version is	contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a	clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds	of years ago by the first followers of christ	4555.3419589015075
5145. originally	recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated	and retranslated through the ages	2135.656799329792
5146. discoveries recently made of	old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings	some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy	of the bible	3236.892585914368
5147. to have the results recorded in everyday usable	english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth	2569.8715028156457
5148. there	is one danger however	14.83014085059412
5149. with contemporary english changing with the	rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the	new version may themselves soon become archaic	4278.890429670493
5150. the only answer will	be continuous study	93.86670847962202
5151. the new testament offered to the public	today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up	of representatives of the church of england church of scotland	methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian	church of england churches in wales churches in ireland	society of friends british and foreign bible society and national	society of scotland	8300.873492638084

5255. he wants to be called sweet	good considerate and mother's little helper	953.3079199649495
5256. but even mother's	loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior	374.9411929600866
5257. his desires	are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's	love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them	4271.785968539656

5272. if he snatches	a toy she says caroline wants her own truck just as you do	1270.8876960428438
5273. there is no use trying to explain to a 2-year-old	558.6897714953687

5277. this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities	and colleges schedule what they call homecoming day	2812.102653119584
5278. they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes	796.535186685411
5279. the football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with	the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian	when thrown to one of the emperor's lions	5167.310741507247
5280. it is true of	course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and	then the christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined	by a visiting team	3438.5286122856073
5281. even with all possible precaution homecomings	are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient	and the continually optimistic are made happy by them	4107.638109634129
5282. more	often than not as the old grad wanders along the old paths his	memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside	him becomes an ache and a pain	3892.707510068113
5283. he can smell again the perfume she	wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the	aroma of autumn- fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia	of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall	6703.157322155768
5284. it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple	of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily	as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting	and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat	4635.2196679202025
5285. usually	they titter loudly after they have passed by	390.997054603045
5286. he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him	643.3996901247314
5287. his	bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous	391.6107172113892
5288. his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had	walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the	old campus paths	2873.2509139297053
5289. bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is	like unripe persimmons in his mouth	1889.3096575414395
5290. it is not much better if	he meets with old classmates	503.3822591269897
5291. too often unless he hails them they	pass him by	560.3307311652542
5292. he recalls with a wry smile the wit who said on returning	from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all	his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him	3777.694506017335
5293. if they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace	the moment soon is done	2120.2784948037356
5294. after all when one has asked whatever became	of old joe and charlie h when one has inquired who it was sue	brown married and where it is they now live h when questions are asked	and answered about families and children and old professors h when	the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted h that does	it	5537.2519577004805
5295. by then one begins to notice the middle-age	spread; the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin	or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty; the athlete of by-gone	years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs	when he has finished a sentence	of any length h then it is time to break it up and move on	8403.477505686054
5296. it is if anything worse on the old player h   he sits	in the stands and he doesn't like that	1891.556605971271
5297. enough of his life was spent	there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator	in the crowd	3705.71312554818
5298. a team feels something	2.9524274561749753
5299. on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next	to him	2823.4647551533753
5300. in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about	him	1103.0474580814368
5301. he sits there remembering the tense moment before the	ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet the rasp of the	canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his	face	5622.868837518892
5302. he remembers the desperate panting breath; the long runs	on the kick-offs; the hard jolting tackles; the breakthrough; the	desperate agony of goal-line stands	2464.228528877035
5303. and so he squirms with each	play remembering his youth	556.917513710697
5304. but it is no use	14.791252002420208
5305. no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and	strength they can never be recaptured again	3257.362177154804
5306. since the obvious is not always true the republican national	committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that	it occurred as suspected in the larger cities	3101.1817788233093
5307. of 40 cities	with populations of 300000 and more mr kennedy carried 26 and mr	nixon 14	2123.827009204869
5308. there are eight states in which the largest urban vote	can be the balance of power in any close election	1867.6023041025323
5309. these are new	york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois	and minnesota	1177.1780213584088
5310. in 1952 mr eisenhower won all but missouri	165.05955953804366
5311. yet in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy	562.2442205771365
5312. republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia	167.2452746298175
5313. mr nixon	despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed	to do so	1900.4316508750471
5314. his visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey	in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which	in several cities is substantial	2856.9543005069368
5315. yet the gop breakdown discovered	that in philadelphia mr nixon received but 21 per cent of	the so-called polish vote; 30 per cent of the irish vote	and 18 per cent of the negro vote	5616.662579534728
5316. a gop task force' committee will seek to find out how its	party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities	2451.7448326045164
5317. the task force might make a start in washington with republican	congressional leaders	1182.9893223920187
5318. these gentlemen already have done the party	harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas	and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession	and unemployment	3551.7251701044006
5319. this error was compounded by declaring the recession	to be a statistical one and not a reality	2126.4858224365125
5320. the almost six	million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do	not consider themselves and their plight as statistical	2194.8326654761718
5321. they did not	view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor	goldberg as politics which the gop declared it to be	4090.0617060197706
5322. the	people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take	an interest in their misery	1720.6207819025399
5323. senator mundt's gross distortion	of president eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation	of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr eisenhower	declared to be entirely false is another case in point	5151.237501166751
5324. if the republicans	and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the	old under the social security program they will thereby erect still	another barrier to gop hopes in the cities	3436.922037702026
5325. the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt goldwater	bridges dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party	leadership of the 1930s	3694.2729832147793
5326. in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr	hoover and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the	depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican	party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human	beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic	crash	5440.505915813386
5327. the republican party was not lacking in humanity	but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear	devoid of any consideration for people in trouble	4258.296155026825
5328. farmers called their	mule-drawn pickup trucks hoover carts	166.64369128560043
5329. smokers reduced to	the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as hoover dust	1194.8759941916146
5330. one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership	hasn't meant to repeat this error	1100.6975758711742
5331. but it is in the process of so	doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john	f kennedy	3044.3741340756364
5332. that this is not good politics is underscored by the	latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like	the way in which the new president is conducting the nation's business	3761.979892071259
5333. the most articulate republicans are those who in their	desire to get back at mr kennedy already have created the image	of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed	and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people	who need medical care	7344.018825208931
5334. if they also defeat the school bill the	gop task force won't have much research to do	1415.8169777292162
5335. it will early	know why the party won't win back city votes	958.1233194312108
5336. the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider	262.5721338854811
5337. the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in	any responsible manner	2103.1169448563846
5338. after the griffin-byrd political troup	has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative	forum this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature	in history	3209.0535786138485
5339. every legislator from brasstown bald to	folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny	as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions	4645.578383772261
5340. hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system	stands less chance than ever	1094.5945048821984
5341. and just how far can the legislature	go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the	midst of a governor's race	3703.587533842166
5342. how unpartisan will be the	recommendations	of lt gov garland byrd's senate committee	on government operations	1254.8784155074911
5343. the situation already was bad because	the legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months	causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual	3885.1727295031023
5344. but	when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted	the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join	the tour next november the situation was aggravated	3214.210349094562
5345. neither	had a choice other than to accept the invitation	563.6665618400568
5346. to have refused	would have been political suicide	167.1089691157776
5347. and it may be that one or both men	actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast	aside	2829.3805857833045
5348. the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard	against the danger of eliminating potential candidates	1256.7176786129628
5349. it wanted	the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious	candidates	961.6655773618174
5350. but state party chairman james gray of albany	said no and he didn't mince any words	1252.9576828518477
5351. they are just asking	too much he said	250.26016811904293
5352. we can't think of anyone else who would want	to separate serious candidates from other candidates either	1409.5914977908128
5353. there are other dangers:   politics is an accelerating game	393.41731148112444
5354. if an opponent accuses you of lying don't deny it	373.0133812142043
5355. say he is	a horse thief runs an old adage	566.2128884485047
5356. if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where	the promises would end	1261.9035287635002
5357. griffin's rural roads authority and byrd's	60000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths	1896.1000953010007
5358. the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such	a good one	1102.155345539148
5359. why not have them travel the state in november debating	559.7604446952037
5360. it would present a forum for them in almost every community	499.86008757740274
5361. but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's	race being run in the next legislature the spectre of big spending	programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin	5316.289138380386
5362. there isa way out of this	42.98512410678763
5363. the chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative	forum	251.36614855800462
5364. it has arranged a campaign for governor	93.9109873656398
5365. if	it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed	next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates	it can provide a service to the state	5356.0952146966165
5366. but the legislature should	be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing	up sides for the race	1730.5768865422701
5367. former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was	not a	great soldier	957.5020520344717
5368. ike's somewhat like george washington	14.782937924028085

5370. congressmen returning from recess say the people admire	president kennedy so much they're even willing to heed his call	to sacrifice- and give up his program	2739.5561235065065
5371. slogan of the john	birch society: paddle your own canoe	563.8411005117924
5372. the guy who makes the	motor boats may be a communist	501.93612609100774
5373. a republican survey says	kennedy	won the '60 election on the religious issue	1185.5708283601898
5374. too many people were	afraid if the gop won they'd have to spend all their time praying	1411.6532882114782
5375. the providence journal editorial entitled east	greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a	dilemma that faces communities such as ours	3275.3636413199465
5376. your suggested solution	it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your	generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning	2451.8045824146197
5377. first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already	zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested	3029.792192588787
5378. this land is in various stages of development in several locations	throughout the town	936.738337130706
5379. the demand for these lots can be met for some	time to come	1184.855202335166
5380. this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither	to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards	for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy	land and build in the new sites	4210.999275689738
5381. what we are attempting to	do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density	residential areas and industrial and commercial development	3896.005564230852
5382. it	is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial	development to help pay governmental costs	1555.4523979110534
5383. bostitch inc is	approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate	tax	1646.5068772865452
5384. the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter	but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory	1889.27775589995
5385. the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this	property in excess of two million dollars	2584.423604815666
5386. with our current $3 per	hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you	suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant	as the best way to meet these problems	4047.620092688333
5387. in order to attract	additional industry that is compatible with this community it is	all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly	balance in the tax structure	4981.739940891532
5388. as this tax base grows so then can your	medium and low density residential areas grow	1256.8945995428312
5389. he went on to say: in the first place industry	per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities	2319.477406873066
5390. it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased	municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be	3250.2882358795277
5391. while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school	costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon	a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes	to find alarm in uncontrolled growth	4285.093554178032
5392. we in east greenwich have the	example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double	sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year	4282.497545762943
5393. it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich	school committee is considering additions to at least one	elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations	for a school population that we know will increase	4292.373555972422
5394. if they are to	be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment	of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage	4454.4534424791245
5395. where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies	within the community that you have called for in other editorials	2027.6954422459999
5396. i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not	facing the facts of life	2352.737533191331
5397. the fruitful course of metropolitanization	that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of	east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it	was called	3086.0992841981906
5398. for example:  the east greenwich police department	utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police	department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and	ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut	area of the two communities	5659.175797134447
5399. the east greenwich	fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich	937.4632794165466
5400. the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money	as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent	county memorial hospital a regional facility	4307.709596330881
5401. the east	greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of	east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment	2321.546348221414
5402. feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick	as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish	disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of	warwick along with east greenwich	5893.945476573744
5403. east greenwich was one	of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with	the rhode island development council for planning services we	could not provide for ourselves	3224.527307669866
5404. the education program for retarded	children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils	from at least one neighboring community	3043.217718817116
5405. i feel compelled	to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community	growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town	such as east greenwich	3431.247801820578
5406. i believe it is an area in which professional	planners have failed to set adequate guide posts; and yet they cannot	ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly	all the planning programs they have devised	6029.776934823594
5407. these programs are	volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must	stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what	manner the community shall grow	3640.7261057013397
5408. we have far less to fear in the migrant	family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions	2816.862794998191
5409. until professional planners meet this situation squarely	and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts	i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny	3561.582840375266
5410. i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to	send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the	gabrielle fund	4281.380007659272
5411. it is indeed true as stated in the famous	novel of our day for whom the bell tolls that no man	is an island entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent	a part of the main	4221.682431408619
5412. thanks to the generosity of mr	irving j fain president of the temple beth el; rev	dewitt clemens pastor of the mathewson street methodist church;	mr felix miranda of the imperial knife co; and to mrs	rozella switzer regional director of the national conference	of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for	the fund	8193.67496907134
5413. it is through them that we have become aware of the divine	humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful	and good	2586.9549586307576
5414. bless you my friends for it is through love and service	that brotherhood becomes a reality	1887.0023807748207
5415. i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school	260.84619424859204
5416. my future	plans are to become a language teacher	392.89335626223107
5417. of course having this desire	i am very interested in education	499.8317104004129
5418. a few weeks ago i read	in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston	2573.91092966989
5419. the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or	over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes	2868.6639426409306
5420. the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students	of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade	3469.3231418142445
5421. i wish you could see the situation as i see it	504.900128104461
5422. if russian	pupils have to take these languages how come american students have	a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many	exceptions	4637.954379879104
5423. i do not think that america is like russia	not in the least! i am proud of my country the small city i live	in my wonderful parents my friends and my school; but i am also	a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language	but is not old enough	5255.042345246854
5424. then people wonder why russian pupils	are more advanced than american students	958.2830606116938
5425. well there lies your answer	14.71326448243643
5426. at the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible	for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency	3245.3037129739814
5427. however	the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my	home in time of desperation	1401.5656070776645
5428. words cannot tell of the undivided	attention and comfort their service gave to me	1399.2901635003057
5429. the concern they	felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always	be grateful	2021.836864997332
5430. the rescue squad is to be praised immensely	for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather	2584.9726316930823
5431. had they not gotten	me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to	commend them at this time	2303.5982654744903
5432. many thanks for a job well	done	141.15544354937654
5433. the providence sunday journal article asking whether	american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway	to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities	sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for	news	4042.6933701018447
5434. usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front	page	1411.3763862521173
5435. on the question of admission to veterans administration	hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled	veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly	affected by war service	3315.603772028192
5436. it can manifest itself before discharge from	service or it can come out years later	1644.7175193056032
5437. there is one other point	we should never lose sight of: many veterans who enter va hospitals	as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected	2458.9620772929065
5438. no psychiatrist	could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its	effect in the ensuing years	2810.2753655907118
5439. the arguments advanced by those individuals	and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically	curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected	case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with	the wishes of the general public	4538.64321641126
5440. i believe in priority for	service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals	1184.0688669135884
5441. but i don't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected	patients	641.5478139101986
5442. this matter is of great importance and the outcome may	mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries	for many veterans	3892.5843113068804
5443. some critics say that the length of stay	in a hospital is too long	941.1383865270309
5444. there's a reason for this length of stay	248.34697350811825
5445. first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets	the patient as a new patient	1423.3034349244851
5446. he has no experience with this veteran's	previous medical record	557.9195068603459
5447. if the doctor is conscientious he wants	to study the patient	503.0270311299297
5448. as a result it takes a little longer than	it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient	3276.0279699503694
5449. secondly the va physician knows that when the patient	leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit	his patient	2592.076170799637
5450. so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects	of treatment or surgery	1887.1543887730677
5451. the american public must be presented	with the facts concerning va hospitalization	642.5847427457214
5452. the public	should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va	hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other	4333.036964034795
5453. the	responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va	hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital	2604.4213305830817
5454. an	adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the	veterans than any 50 state hospitals	2601.455447624413
5455. it seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is	once more upon us	786.9118879968357
5456. the american medical association is once again	grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the	veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer	4285.161087216284
5457. do they the ama offer any solution other than outright	abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world	1873.2337856499653
5458. we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand	for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age	fosters illness	3706.214193954638
5459. nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama	on the health problem confronting the aged	1255.0540043111441
5460. they opposed	the forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial	support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction;	yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will	cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars	to initiate	6664.64016493259
5461. no doubt there have	been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house	has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even	panic	2738.330551399589
5462. this we can sympathetically understand	22.472996349198375
5463. but no president ever	before referred to his as a lousy job as walter trohan recently	quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen	barry goldwater	2876.8597519282134
5464. during his aggressive campaign to win	his present position mr kennedy was vitriolic about this country's	prestige abroad	2333.758097273247
5465. what does he think a remark like this lousy	one does to our prestige and morale	1268.6125252916333
5466. if the president	of the united states really feels he won himself a lousy job	then heaven help us all	2817.392878667119
5467. defense secretary robert s mcnamara	has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters	costing about 200 million dollars	2036.3726652565051
5468. why should congress even consider	allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection	1885.3264152688328
5469. top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of	massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would	persist for a long time	3223.5341933595328
5470. the scientists have also warned that no life	above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected	to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter	4657.320905683227
5471. this	sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace	or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries	would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased	world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe	4765.724296701806
5472. let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the	end of civilization	2118.4783978890696
5473. it seems college isn't what it should be	166.82727940951628
5474. i refer to	the attire worn by the students	393.56725099539295
5475. upon a visit to a local junior college	last week i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts	and the young men wearing bermuda shorts	3001.8804480824183
5476. is this what	our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college	in a few years	3262.004377149762
5477. education should be uppermost in their minds but	with this attire how can anyone think it is so	1567.6866005962218
5478. it looks more like	they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering	themselves	2596.7409319878357
5479. high school students have more sense of the	way to dress than college students	944.1012563865024
5480. many high school students go past	my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen	2379.5782737918826
5481. no matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts	941.1055758037286
5482. the granting of	the jan masaryk award august 13 to senator paul douglas is a bitter	example of misleading minorities	2828.520851496004
5483. douglas has consistently	voted to aid the people who killed masaryk and against principles	masaryk died to uphold	1566.2703973180135
5484. douglas has voted for aid to communists and	for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid	etc	2582.3229170104787
5485. aug	8 the cta is urged to reduce fares	for senior citizens	639.4495203285082
5486. rising costs have increased the difficulties	of the elderly and i would be the last to say they should not receive	consideration	3281.288728709168
5487. but why is it the special responsibility of the cta	to help these people	941.9309046238859
5488. why should cta regular riders	subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the	people who drive their own cars or walk to work should	4109.323526614289
5489. the welfare	of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community	not only of that part of it that rides the cta	2458.1343650446383
5490. cta regulars	already subsidize transportation for school children policemen	and firemen	753.052550239054
5491. in	reply to a letter in today's voice urging the sale of meat after	6 p m i wish to state the other side of the story	2864.9776728838087
5492. i	am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market	1173.6845625664812
5493. my husband's	hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a	m to 7 p m the early part of the week and as late as 8 or	9 on week-ends	3790.874807591932
5494. now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-	and sundays too for this is coming	2123.8704961479148
5495. there is a trend to	packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying	stores where meat cutters will not be required	2712.73509320917
5496. if a customer	wishes a special cut it will not be available	954.7983420275671
5497. we are slowly being	regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not	1093.8832264443486
5498. most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week	on week-ends when prices are lower	2353.538382302709
5499. also many working wives have children	or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them	1252.0520079148223
5500. independent market owners work six days a week; and my husband hasn't	had a vacation in 14 years	2372.896101326108
5501. no we are not greedy	14.737691646670774
5502. but if we closed	the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain	stores in the next block	3270.6649671804653
5503. the meat cutters' union which has	a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area	represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets	3345.299311536049
5504. what it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well	as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice	of cut being made by the consumer not the store	6183.862003680287
5505. convention and sidney holzman	- i too	congratulate the american legion of which i am proud to have been	a member for more than 40 years on the recent state convention	2356.236486117004
5506. i regret that bertha madeira today's voice obtained	incorrect information	561.4396822321708
5507. had i been granted the floor on a point of	personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified	1882.4540901730302
5508. the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require	the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the	american flag	3481.0878354871247
5509. judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of	election commissioners are instructed to do this	1251.9963903326645
5510. the resolution	further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment	to their premises for the display of the flag	2835.431468157566
5511. it was my desire	to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling	places are on private property and without an amendment to the law	we could not enforce this	3557.5451027884906
5512. my discussion with reference to the resolution	was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of	election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors	who make available their private premises and not by innuendo	criticize them	6555.356415270357
5513. at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation	for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners	for the discharge of their duties	2845.345648404827
5514. the illinois commission for handicapped	children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic	charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of	the establishment of the institute for special education at the university	for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally	retarded children	7216.092749682551
5515. in these days of serious shortage	of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped	and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute	will be a major contribution to the field	3554.727723005412
5516. i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed	your june 25 article on liberace and to thank you for it	2318.969500202312
5517. please	do put more pictures and articles in about liberace as he is truly	one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person	3712.4618734931014
5518. is this	perhaps	one of the things that is wrong with our country	791.1544001919312
5519. engineering	graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving	the highest average starting salaries in the school's history-	$550 a month	3267.896611473164
5520. my son who has completed two years in engineering	school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled	laborer	2196.5377279703976
5521. at a rate of $3	22.142731223486038
5522. 22 an hour he is now earning approximately	$580 a month	504.1355239026417
5523. ironic is it not that after completing years	of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what	he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer	4659.272124444943
5524. case	editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this	page	501.6974596361327
5525. your july 26 editorial regarding	the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective	tax relief for du pont stockholders is based on an erroneous	statement of fact	4658.393134515826
5526. as a result your criticism of attorney general	robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate	unwarranted and unfair	2025.2078858210687
5527. the editorial concerned legislative proposals	to ease the tax burden on du pont stockholders in connection	with the united states supreme court ruling that du pont must divest	itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings	5766.939021481919
5528. these proposals	would reduce the amount of tax that du pont stockholders might	have to pay- from an estimated 1	1877.145886238192
5529. 1 billion dollars under present	law to as little as 192 million dollars	1181.263226652017
5530. congressman wilbur d	mills chairman of the house ways and means committee asked	the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals	as they related to anti-trust law enforcement	3329.1101010230204
5531. the attorney general	responded by letter dated july 19	391.49196981275895
5532. copies of this letter were made	avaliable to the press and public	641.3934287953608
5533. in this letter mr kennedy	made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration-	what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust	judgments	4490.596583570879
5534. there are a number of other considerations besides	this one but it is for the congress not the department of justice	to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation	3451.4205097999265
5535. yet your editorial said: now the attorney general	writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this	proportion'	2820.589264462749
5536. what mr kennedy in fact wrote was: it	is the department's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations	justify any loss of revenue of this proportion	2588.231920481262
5537. the	editorial by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement totally	distorted mr kennedy's views	1187.7557151372316
5538. the headline is offensive particularly	in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial	940.875104765107
5539. church	- i concur most heartily	with today's letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen	and sen douglas	1643.4974586710214
5540. but when you write to congresswoman	church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely	1419.3234850603578
5541. should she disagree she explains why in detail	250.22355609922374
5542. when she agrees	you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged	641.6421018526713
5543. i think	we have the hardest working best representative in congress	752.8724987030567
5544. drinks	- a recent news story	reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed 103 airplane	passengers 10 minutes in london while they finished their drinks	1797.5055368745275
5545. they do our country great harm by such actions	391.00013154680585
5546. those in the public	eye should be good examples of american citizens while abroad	939.363310149028
5547. the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra	and martin to guzzle	1873.403569918899
5548. overt socialism means government ownership and management	of a nation's main industries	643.765120960509
5549. in covert socialism- toward	which america is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership	title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive	regulations actually controls them	4295.176673773016
5550. in order to attract	new industries 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build	government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise	2739.150319043188
5551. this	is a step toward overt socialism	141.49666728152644
5552. issuing bonds for plant construction	has brought new industries to certain regions	644.7464835611514
5553. sir- we are	writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff	of the public health nursing service of jersey city		2354.2097795350965
5554. the day before election day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday	we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers	of the party	3210.3132525746378
5555. being ethical and professional people	interested in community health and well-being we felt this wasn't	a function of our position	2807.523974896336
5556. such tactics reek of totalitarianism!	as we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes	1570.207013128718
5557. to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed	because of political affiliation	1636.4282038619551
5558. we therefore considered the suggestion	an insult to our intelligence ethics bill of rights	etc	1097.1115247351297
5559. our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion	for the person we feel is capable in directing the public	3494.6605493587804
5560. this is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens	of the united states	1420.4672569571735
5561. _to the	sir- i read of a man who felt he should not build	a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to	sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters	5775.6270899879355
5562. does this man live in	a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves	but ready to demand that the community help and protect them	2858.3161166140576
5563. community shelters are of course necessary for those	having	no space for shelter	1182.4307157864823
5564. if in a town of 2000 private homes half of	them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced	to that extent	2581.3295927298395
5565. in designing his home fallout shelter there	is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants	plus-one- so he will be able to take in a stranger	4984.718405409183
5566. i	hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes	will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of	our plus-one shelter club	3647.4716693097935
5567. sir- people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer	space	1181.8972879524863
5568. it's simple enough from my point of view	166.92531162365984
5569. it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's	world	1654.7106525264037
5570. sir- when	the colonies decided upon freedom from england we insisted through	the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize	us as a separate political entity	3116.4827420965194
5571. it is high time the united	states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth	in that document are applicable today to katanga	4072.1384808804287
5572. in the united	nations charter the right of self-determination is also an essential	principle	945.7223885266903
5573. this again applies to katanga	22.10448696579509
5574. the people of katanga	had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist	yoke of antoine gizenga and his cohorts	2039.9384957754094
5575. by political economic geographic	and natural standards they were justified in doing so	1181.73891588871
5576. the united states and the un denounce their own principles	when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge	the right of self-determination of the katangans	2863.584857324198
5577. college costs	sir- permit me to commend	your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county	colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers	have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit	them to	7010.651788360208
5578. the bill which passed the assembly last may and	is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny	1882.222877147627
5579. the procedure	for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges	and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers	3469.4873960084797
5580. under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county	college will be appointed; none will be elected	2033.051651620753
5581. the trustees	will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board	of school estimate	2590.96658028655
5582. this board will consist of two of the trustees	of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders	2323.908613225368
5583. it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college	and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall	appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made	by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied	and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes	8263.005930950229
5584. the approval of only three members of the board of	school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted	to the college	2721.8622359085643
5585. since two of these could be trustees of the college	actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected	official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue	5640.435325989327
5586. this is taxation without representation	14.757079517627659
5587. sir- your editorial	housing speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems	1414.1339975921308
5588. the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary	case of slum conditions	1103.3111766401098
5589. change our taxing law so that no tax	shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties	3047.6160902800375
5590. then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance	at no cost to taxpayers will happen	1884.079436086083
5591. our entire economy will have	a terrific uplift	251.6313813802611
5592. sir- an old man is kicked to death by muggers	373.73593811476906
5593. the medical examiner	states that death was due to natural causes	750.3896267405078
5594. i once	heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york	it is listed as death due to natural causes	2738.6667454798994
5595. exhibit	sir- every resident of this city	should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit our changing	skyline in newark	3049.9576762949737
5596. it will be at the museum until march 30	262.058276325829
5597. it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done	and what will be done in newark as shown by architects' plans models	and pictures	4476.650927039169
5598. it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and	certainly make every newarker proud of this city	1569.146678154134
5599. it should	also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious	life of the community so that that phase of newark will live	up to the challenge presented by this exhibit	5445.523946261189
5600. sir- i hasten to join in praise of the	men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway	1726.592665794383
5601. recently i traveled	the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most	courteous group of men you will find anywhere	3702.209414298866
5602. one even gave my little	dog a biscuit	166.8656881350292
5603. the viewers of the deep peep show	at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction- the view	of a fossilized cypress swamp	3722.3742310379303
5604. twenty feet below the street level	in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black	coal-like deposit has been encountered	2732.229026116607
5605. this is a black swamp	clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees	were growing	2359.066515382808
5606. the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found	embedded in the clay	946.3497998635306
5607. some of the stumps are as much as three feet	long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying	sediments	3886.314526112355
5608. although the wood has been changed to coal much	of it still retains its original cell structure	1397.696407298233
5609. in the clay are	entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants	growing in the region at the time	3258.24003574801
5610. these microfossils indicate the	swamp was formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs	were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing	2846.327975874891
5611. the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with	the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported	in the washington post august 2 1955 which was probably	formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger	6572.883481756372
5612. recently the secretary of the friends	committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air	1097.368746947876
5613. while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points	that i would like to question	2361.5123626378017
5614. he said let's work for	peace instead of protection from aggression	500.82749717842637
5615. i would ask why	not do both	141.34071633982273
5616. military power does not cause war; war is the result	of mistrust and lack of understanding between people	1564.008910207016
5617. are we not	late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough	about this lack of understanding	2793.3176943212156
5618. as to protection	the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters	would not save everyone	1410.6235921664484
5619. is this a reason for saving no one	251.14887169504922
5620. would	the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his	boat could not pick up everyone	2043.1132404898908
5621. the speaker suggested	that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face	1884.5083429655024
5622. if the world comes to this wouldn't it be the very time when courage	and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild	2453.731904557433
5623. many of our young people think it would	251.67315364878337
5624. lastly the speaker	decried our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian	defense	942.3353869886557
5625. in 1950 public law 920 created civil defense	a responsibility	of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property	in disaster natural or manmade	4663.910820362544
5626. far from creating fear	as the speaker suggests preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency-	gives people confidence	1735.705485021781
5627. civil defense has far to go and	many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer	tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families	and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm flood accident	or even war	7343.4251324800425
5628. it seems rather peculiar	that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves	with the protection and companionship of dogs	2183.5723698853953
5629. i feel that few	burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment	if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide	4650.690156879458
5630. in	addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded	a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets	if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash	3758.063771520636
5631. i grant that	the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you	were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady	to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with	a dog	7021.370971507822
5632. i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners	get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting	dogs in apartments	2173.0312611771847
5633. use the terraces of the	capitol for a sidewalk cafe	560.7184452479737
5634. could senator humphrey be serious	in his proposal	166.12624078377206
5635. is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'	comfort	754.9934166267456
5636. perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could	be extended	259.6344839907475
5637. the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak	249.39037834192555
5638. why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel	too far to eat	1726.3599165644416
5639. unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money	to support themselves during the off season	1643.667854862227
5640. as an added suggestion	to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space	on the washington monument	1576.5407001364254
5641. it is visible throughout the city and	men from madison ave would jump at the chance	1899.9893066166987
5642. sen	hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart	645.3331331940402
5643. he like	most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by	the great outdoors	2807.4049272396314
5644. let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas	around fountains and gardens	794.1604469890719
5645. let us like the french have outdoor	cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing	crowd	2828.4221557597693
5646. two strong dissents from	the majority report of the joint economic committee by	senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy	of the thirties did not work	3221.555760606351
5647. soviets said to fear resurgence of	german militarism	for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large	powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional	warfare of the past a nullity	6065.703689069032
5648. the united states and soviet	russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations	940.7644237442864
5649. recent	statements	by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power	of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient	to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead	of negotiations	5502.146874961789
5650. president kennedy was right when he said we	shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate	2020.8115395184705
5651. i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and	the far east	1417.3622974625894
5652. it is quite evident that the people of western europe	are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war	1723.7147406434003
5653. the	fact is that the italians french and british know that they have	no defense against nuclear bombs	2364.0452359211276
5654. we have no right to criticize them	as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war	1723.1121138723865
5655. we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access	into berlin	1420.273772792762
5656. it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to	prevent us	636.2671758624517
5657. but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from	granting de facto recognition to east germany	2592.431592404978
5658. soviet russia has	been invaded twice by german troops in a generation	639.7003185330675
5659. in the last war	russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories	were devastated	2349.479556335634
5660. the truth is that communist	russia fears the resurgence of german militarism	639.7879464190347
5661. berlin is merely	being used by moscow as a stalking horse	758.4424130377982
5662. actually the	communists	out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing	to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral	and have its independence guaranteed by the u n	3956.730601187469
5663. if	the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed	germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this	nuclear age	4093.2251423558055
5664. it could provide security without cost of armaments and	increase german prosperity and lessen taxation	1096.9082989048616
5665. france and other western	european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany	752.0510965969078
5666. if the german	people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following	the example of austria	1569.286417377225
5667. president kennedy has urged a	peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival	which has many facets	2583.0117407430275
5668. why not make a beginning with a united and	disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing	would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states	3256.9929014058134
5669. a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward	disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world	3060.888480722776
5670. u n obligations	_to the editor of the new york	in your editorial of sept 30 the smoldering congo	you make the following comment: far too many states are following	the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments	4133.570348972611
5671. it	is up to the assembly to take action against them	748.7639891572464
5672. they are violating	their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension	of membership or expulsion	1412.7604250212405
5673. i would like to quote from	the charter of the united nations:   article 17 section	1: the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget	of the organization	4496.269395588062
5674. section 2: the expenses of the	organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general	assembly	1736.6912920395232
5675. article 19: a member of the united nations	which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions	to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if	the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions	due from it for the preceding two full years	7723.996966971009
5676. the u	s s r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations	to the regular budget	1575.0642516588073
5677. but they refuse as do the arab states	to support the united nations' expenses of maintaining the united	nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between	egypt and israel and the u n troops in the congo which	expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations	but by a special budget	8173.696206798125
5678. according to the official interpretation	of the charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the	right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial	obligations to the special united nations' budgets and of	course cannot be expelled from the organization	due to the fact that there is no provision in the	charter for expulsion	5429.9292228113645
5679. connally	amendment's repeal held step toward world orderto the	in your sept 27 editorial appraisal	of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress	you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time	of acute national and world peril	6813.307482605926
5680. yet your list of things left	undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country's	domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute	of the international court of justice	3529.7742162780078
5681. the connally	amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall	determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction	of the united states in a case before the world court to which	the united states is a party	6593.390759770273
5682. if the case is thus determined by us	to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction	1263.5078780395972
5683. since the connally	amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other	party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from	using the court effectively	5170.79699039827
5684. yet although the kennedy administration	and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves	solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to	our best interests no action has yet been taken	3667.874611621753
5685. our destiny	in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit	of peace with justice under law	2811.209779697548
5686. to achieve this destiny acts	as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength	but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect	3460.4470669052826
5687. what better affirmative step could be taken to this end	than repeal of the connally amendment- an act which could expose	the	united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging	attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance	in a tangible way the cause of international law and order	8118.225875506085
5688. we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the	eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate	of the connally amendment	2857.032708445893
5689. _to	many home-bound subway riders	utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with	the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their	express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained	5790.8837674825245

5696. it has not	been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization	which has brought about new ways of dialing	2597.4356494404287
5697. however there	are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone	operators	1628.0568566956208
5698. i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the	young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls special long-distance	calls etc	2033.843710624292
5699. either it is lack of training lack of proper	screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest	on the part of the telephone company which does have a government-blessed	monopoly	5303.413910838293
5700. i disagree with the	writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled	641.1740170248975

5723. some members of the organization called attention	also to the article on hymns of inspiration the daily prayer and	three minutes a day as being very helpful	4288.09313240936
5724. we feel that	the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles	on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material	along wholesome lines	3222.093754713628
5725. thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy	to impudence	1414.2355105066079

5727. why has	this form of gentility gone out of american life	744.3218114507233
5728. how can	we old-fashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect	from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on	tv without denying the children the use of television entirely	3743.5494829154873
5729. writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern	parents they have observed	1880.555338090008
5730. from necessity they are also inspired	by the hard-sell attitude of the sponsor so finally it	is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste	of his advertising	3553.1130871538285
5731. i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national	park in the dunes area	2113.5918840523495

5735. i worked on the schuylkill	expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock	and concrete there wouldn't be an expressway	3903.6685085545346
5736. without these massive	trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future	938.8196242078495
5737. mr george hough sounds like a business man who waits	until the last minute to leave his home or shop	2810.2121571970124
5738. the trucks today	help pay for this highway	165.83592674351536
5739. they try to keep within the speed limits	252.2510011422276
5740. although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver	has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road	2478.115284265984
5741. the	letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school	at 14 should have signed his letter simpleton instead of	simplicitude	3663.5135152942566
5742. such kids only wind up among the unemployed	on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden	1888.9176973698457
5743. there are	lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for	the dropouts	1873.6332882507054
5744. what we need is more vocational training in high schools	not more dropouts	791.6406825461862
5745. _to the editor of the	i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly	cannot see how two wrongs can make a right! i am referring	to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because	russia is	6437.194629786029
5746. will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less	harmful to future generations of children	1409.9246335543046
5747. if an atom bomb in 1945	could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have	is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it	4826.850619334971
5748. as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack	enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have-	at least the bombs- can inflict all the demage that is necessary	4038.2532685191486
5749. why	do we need bigger and better bombs	251.09012865575988
5750. i repeat two wrongs do not	make a right	261.60111346624046
5751. everyone should take time to read martin luther's hymn	a mighty fortress is our god	1644.80731509692
5752. especially the	first half of the third verse:	_to	the editor of the inquirer: we led the	world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the	first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki	3861.393316754316
5753. having led the world	in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead	it out of the race	3869.515854827904
5754. are we to be the master of the atom or	will the atom be our master- and destroy us!	just because cheddi	jagan new boss of british guiana was educated in the united states	is no reason to think he isn't a red	4484.496160192472
5755. we have quite a few home-grown	specimens of our own	561.7548239060864
5756. if we go all gooey over this newest castro	we've got rocks in our heads	1097.2389364368823
5757. how	many times must we get burned before we learn	558.6115347145496
5758. just to remind the communists	that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start	one	1727.0243928048112
5759. the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed	on both sides	1414.015892383934
5760. intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets	of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london	or pearl harbor	2030.7917981062128
5761. that is why the united nations was formed so that	intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet	and solve problems without resorting to war	4275.7142603706
5762. russia has showed	its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the	world	1404.4772213134452
5763. why aren't the soviets expelled from the un	253.53757223006582
5764. while	better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous	award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold	strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation	3551.5417319681155
5765. had	it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations	was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in	pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task	5017.980196195706
5766. according	to one report however mr hammarskjold was considered too	controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last	spring	2169.5897759254954
5767. actually of course that label controversial applied	only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world	organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet	union	5168.16178743763
5768. at khrushchev's door therefore can be placed	the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves	to be intimidated	2182.047591845163
5769. it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a	coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed	3880.912722507071
5770. as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize	true greatness has been inadequate and tardy	1729.668178968735
5771. just a brief note of	appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver	bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of people to people	good will	4274.044808695266
5772. if only this could be done more often- with such	heartening results- many of the earth's big problems would	shrink to the insignificances they really are	2740.019973023166
5773. thanks	for your good coverage of ahmad's visit too!	answer: east river drive	your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway	are valuable; however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition	4478.714200711861
5774. one of the problems associated with the expressway	stems from the basic idea	791.2016959247209
5775. we shuffle a large percentage of the cars	across the river twice	953.9307147492002
5776. they start on the east side of the schuylkill	have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over	again to the east at their destination	3218.6849199588078
5777. bridges tunnels and ferries	are the most common methods of river crossings	955.2712575978118
5778. each one of these	is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion	1424.4736014608723
5779. we	should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep	cars starting and ending on the east side of the river- on the east	side	4286.186921187351
5780. this can be accomplished by several logical steps:	so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage	paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead	directional lights as on our bridges	3561.70909084577
5781. one additional lane would then	be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the	traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent	4088.74592245081
5782. this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures	necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying	the natural beauty of the east river drive	2457.8179689431236
5783. washington square	i wish	to advocate two drastic changes in washington square:  take	away george washington's statue	2107.688928706837
5784. replace it with the	statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators	938.9319819639461
5785. there's	no sense in being reminded of times that were	552.6896372908242
5786. washington square seems	not part of a free land	262.26782931331775
5787. it may remind one of russia china or	east berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that washington	and the continental soldiers fought for	4093.335471233716
5788. the fairmount	park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it	is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square	2460.764523441604
5789. the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but it's	a very good start on the road to totalitarianism h the commission	has posted signs in washington square saying:   the	feeding of birds is prohibited in this square	6581.596326457429
5790. fairmount	park commission   does each tentacle of the octopus of	city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers	an annoyance	2464.969334894632
5791. if birds don't belong in a square or park what	does	753.0015138675883
5792. they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature	634.3751791875767
5793. the trees are their homes; but the commission does not share	such sentiments	1179.9563963228236
5794. the whole official city apparently has an	intense hatred toward birds	507.2246728287504
5795. starlings and blackbirds are scared off	by cannon from city hall	755.422003281974
5796. if any are	left presently we may expect to see signs specifically	the feeding of them too	1407.1373403054683
5797. the city government is not	united in an all-out to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs delinquents	thugs murderers rapists subversives	2831.64997015718
5798. let every	policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe lest one	piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive	2730.4524650525627
5799. of	course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and	innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them	and afraid to protest and say how come	5475.608773253318
5800. what's your motive	0.20041515
5801. wants this deed done	4.455670655832511
5802. - in this small way do	the leaders of a city or of a nation iniure the masses to watching	or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men	2366.0010785656714
5803. one means to help the birds occurs to me: let the chimes that	ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music	but one	4069.444173118873
5804. let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody	has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn abide with	me	2459.5071164837664
5805. we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what	the birds would ask:	_to	there is a trend today to bemoan	the fact that americans are too soft	5179.0578826141555
5806. unfortunately those who	would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics	789.7072961814501
5807. they	are working on the wrong part of our anatomy	561.6200590460114
5808. it is not our bodies	but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft	1097.0134432042016
5809. ashamed of our wealth	and power afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace	we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies	3910.266022938368
5810. america doesn't need	to push-up she needs to stand up!	the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is	fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has	some merit	5639.646482594978
5811. however he states unequivocally the scandals in business	are far less significant than the scandals in labor	1414.9039975059047
5812. i must	in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so-called	scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals	3673.350820422871
5813. the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan	hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts	1256.128163391346
5814. these arrangements	would have been impossible if the business community was truly	interested in the welfare of its employes	2600.029377392563
5815. a sweetheart arrangement	can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous	labor leaders demanding tribute	1895.7615623766578
5816. anyone familiar with the details	of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart	arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented	the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders	5137.1650730679485
5817. further it	should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress	to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the	landrum-griffin act	2977.6711609938643
5818. the nuclear war is already being fought	except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet	2825.1752023323197
5819. it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with	the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories	1724.4967806924756
5820. they predicted	escalation and escalation is what we are getting	559.1573936771566
5821. the biggest nuclear	device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons	although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs	apiece	2617.3420227365145
5822. some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when	bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them	2587.830289691539
5823. he seems	to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand since we cannot	assume that he has exploded his entire stock	2599.7607631310357
5824. and now of course	the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side	1880.713915473035
5825. khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb	94.6278796645694
5826. so be it- then	we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common	or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said	to be the coming thing	5636.998710418078
5827. so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more	accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other	instead of on their respective proving grounds	2470.3851119941655
5828. what is needed	philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun	is a discontinuity	1416.986948133465
5829. the escalation must end sometime and probably	quite soon	260.27502301078414
5830. only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison	writes	393.0755972611535
5831. the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction	or that of diplomatic policy	1086.7569526498023
5832. morrison points out	that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red	china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers- europe of	course must be written off out of hand	5769.3835940530935
5833. he feels therefore that to	seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the	least risky path our government can take	2594.0360595315615
5834. his proposal is opposed to	that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss	and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller	and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation	of the cold war	6310.974585992885
5835. these gentlemen are calling for a resumption	of testing- in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale all	in the name of national security	2473.9099531767615
5836. escalation is their first love and	their last; they will be faithful unto death	1416.340882443757
5837. capable as their	minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nation's	security are incapable of learning or even of observing	2326.9793545701677
5838. if this capacity	had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a	disastrous miscalculation	2365.0949103414932
5839. he has gained only one thing- he has exploded	a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust	to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges	3017.552609640002
5840. but if his	purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried	more obviously	1884.5905356798926
5841. not terror but anger and resentment have been the	general	reaction outside the soviet sphere	1102.8743753280453
5842. khrushchev himself is	reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet	our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his	footsteps	4470.233783628534
5843. when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success	of another it is only natural	1098.2417415174293
5844. thus when the russians sent up their	first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination	to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable	4069.4824442732934
5845. but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of	his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly	2180.336228314429
5846. when east germans fled to the west by the thousands paeans of	joy rose from the throats of western publicists	2812.928400553982
5847. they are less vocal	now when it is the west berliners who are migrating	940.3585799034796
5848. the flood	is not as great- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative	account- but it is symptomatic	2843.88171178194
5849. west berlin morale is low and	in age distribution the situation is unfavorable	793.0775255751213
5850. nearly 18 per cent	of west berlin's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older	only 12	1659.500614086281
5851. 8 per cent are under fifteen	43.77277777356723
5852. r h s crossman	mp writing in the manchester guardian states that	departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700	but of 1700 a week and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a	week	6329.981615286544
5853. the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers	or independent professional people	1097.2679583502313
5854. whole families are moving and	removal firms are booked for months ahead	961.3068978191677
5855. the weekly loss is partly	counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany but the	hard truth says crossman is that the closing off of east berlin	without interference from the west and with the use only of east	german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory	which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow	5599.146671277807
5856. the	gallant half-city is dying on its feet	250.83933269606229
5857. another piece of	evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer	798.1718000944395
5858. mark arnold-foster writes: people are leaving west berlin	because they think it is dying	1416.9907914630217
5859. they are leaving so fast that	the president of the west german employers' federation issued an	appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six	months' front-line work in factories in west berlin	3947.890567961572
5860. berlin's	resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the	struggle will be hard indeed	3043.4625909041615
5861. the handwriting is on the wall	43.66984542672601
5862. the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will	bring down the wall and reunite the city	2837.677682380038
5863. state department officials	refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks	into east berlin under military escort will not avail	2467.016201534342
5864. tanks lined	up at the border will be no more helpful	752.4375816368799
5865. the materials for compromise	are at hand: the nation walter lippmann and other sober	commentators have spelled them out again	and again	2182.4081417438133
5866. a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of	triumph but it will save berlin	1870.4429525784349
5867. or the city can be a graveyard monument	to western intransigence if that is what the west wants	1574.4663245504905
5868. the removal of stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared	with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not	unprecedented in history	3888.4041779618515
5869. it is in fact a relatively mild chastisement	of the dead	501.8350272040433
5870. a british writer richard haestier in a book	dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding	the french revolution the body of henry 4 who had died nearly	180 years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob	6347.895928564445
5871. and in england after	the restoration the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at	tyburn	1261.6385321377202
5872. the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the	rest of the body was buried under the gallows	3058.170164343496
5873. contemplating	these posthumous punishments stalin should not lose all hope	374.67343896620685
5874. in 1899	parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing	whitehall and there presumably he still stands	2361.50026569029
5875. nikita khrushchev	however has created yet another problem for himself	372.81313932666063
5876. the lenin tomb	is obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow is a crowded city	and the creed of communism deplores waste	3054.353132692495
5877. who will take stalin's	place beside lenin	93.58706586615048
5878. there is karl marx of course buried in	london	390.0043392476594
5879. the macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has	been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could	not make him look presentable	3003.056382565464
5880. who then is of sufficient stature to	lodge with lenin	561.688471359181
5881. who but nikita himself	2.939556549061555
5882. since he has just	shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor	in the gift of the soviet people	4074.5271380801473
5883. besides he can hardly avoid musing	on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations	seems to match that of life	2302.8939043670107
5884. suppose he did lie beside lenin	would it be permanent	558.3811087672999
5885. if some future khrushchev decided to	rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory	workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession	2719.7856903072056
5886. when	a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put	1182.2583864509418
5887. if nikita buys	a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand	947.9952587408641
5888. the appointment of u thant of burma as the	un's acting secretary general- at this writing the choice	appears to be certain- offers further proof that in politics	it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential	friends	6589.28980105816
5889. mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland	were early	favorites in the running but france didn't like the	former and the soviet union would have none of the latter	3334.743709784848
5890. with the	neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed	mr	hammarskjold u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely	to be waylaid by a veto	4665.04453556836
5891. what is interesting is that his positive	qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to	his candidacy	2178.610680728788
5892. in all the bitter in-fighting the squabbles over election	procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played	on the assistant secretaries' theme the gentleman from burma showed	himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat	6361.204627436448
5893. he has	moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future	498.31741278994275
5894. he is a buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of	human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable	weltanschauung	4294.370653352361
5895. u thant of course will hold office until	the spring of 1963 when mr hammarskjold's term would have come	to an end	2190.202277863268
5896. whether the compromises- on both sides- that made	possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen	2816.8565874081205
5897. mr khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant not dead;	the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism	that u thant represents	2735.577496185969
5898. in a sense the showdown promised by mr	hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents	have been set as yet; structurally the un is still	fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership	are bringing to bear upon it	6905.570778223329
5899. but at least the pessimists who believed	that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane	crash in the congo have been proved wrong	2863.5345120649336
5900. no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are	their sole staple in trade	2359.8592794359856
5901. these are mentalities which crave action-	and they are beginning to get it as messrs salsich and engh	report on page 372	2181.6874172891294
5902. even in areas where political connotations are	left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading	1656.1983294093316
5903. friends a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers describes	a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone	company at foley alabama	2163.364783004298
5904. if the day should ever come that	foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast the account reads	they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained	telephone employees- all girls	5317.577110847739
5905. h heavily armed and mobilized	as a fast-moving civil defense outfit 23 operators and office	personnel h stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice	2859.938226792396
5906. according to friends the unit was organized by john snook	a former world war 2 commando who is vice president and general	manager of the telephone company	4290.114453515131
5907. the girls very fetching in their	uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;	they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols	rifles and other such ladies' accessories	3665.5214803985136
5908. this may be opera	bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war	mount in frenzy	2578.540147279777
5909. the country is committed to the doctrine of security	by military means	641.1514380727657
5910. the doctrine has never worked; it is not working	now	558.6052309575259
5911. the official military establishment can only threaten to use	its nuclear arms; it cannot bring them into actual play	1725.9115359190334
5912. a more dangerous	formula for national frustration cannot be imagined	560.8296539203709
5913. as the civic	temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier- but	the guns are real	1579.715527349885
5914. soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they	are assured are in our midst	1884.0222374129305
5915. all false gods resemble moloch at least in the early phases of their	careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship	to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice	3638.807900447977
5916. but there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish	cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands	3671.532570028657
5917. the annual	butchery of 40000 american men women and children to satiate	its blood-lust is excessive; a quota of 25000 a year would be more	than sufficient	2865.7342551084175
5918. no other popular idol is accorded even that much	grace	564.1776402968119
5919. if the railroads for example regularly slaughtered 25000	passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause	to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite	demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states	4545.478158071401
5920. but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively	new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it	may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily	6060.722434087672
5921. yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective	the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical	2327.5288269587827
5922. here	then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of	a beginning	1883.6760943611757
5923. from next new year's day let us keep careful account	of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all	media of communication	2459.321512148628
5924. to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand	of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five	thousandth corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery	be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners	6581.096766291239
5925. then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution	on july 4 1963	1255.7656046928064
5926. the scene of course should be nine miles northwest	of centralia illinois the geographical center of population according	to the census	3038.2552309277507
5927. a special grandstand protected by awnings from	the midsummer sun of illinois should be erected for occupancy by	honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new african	nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is	thoroughly civilized	4463.493742492784
5928. the band should play the rogues' march as a	processional switching to hail columbia happy land! as	the trap is sprung	3078.38294098787
5929. independence day is the appropriate date	as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments	are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable	rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive	of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish	it	5296.699340455919
5930. the highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds	up 40000 americans every year the government is destroying its own	taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do	5656.514498702545
5931. hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government	but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual	citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for	the better	3345.850268615509
5932. moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively	political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social	2114.786422049339
5933. it	would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some	of its ancillary beliefs and practices- for instance the doctrine	that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon	not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the	cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put	5608.960899594772
5934. true the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor	even a miniscule sect and their credo home-keeping hearts are	happiest is as disreputable as socinianism	4510.713958096266
5935. nonetheless although	few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the	hardshell baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital	principle embodied in their faith	3435.714235209295
5936. perhaps there is more truth than we	are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia	robert ruark's grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse	of the modern world is all this gallivantin'	5885.605480278651
5937. in any	event the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victims is a hecatomb too large	to be justified by the most ardent faith	2172.6910297726336
5938. somehow our contemporary moloch	must be induced to see reason	560.6146746103689
5939. since appeals to morality to humanity	and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse	is the deterrent example	2175.6893511437984
5940. if we make it established custom that	whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond 25000	per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the	more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson	6070.461404675656
5941. to hang 50	governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related	to the highways; so all things considered the highway commissioners	would seem to be elected	3094.055609500938
5942. as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly	around the earth the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime	against the human race	4289.806513336699
5943. but the guilt is shared by the united states	britain and france the other members of the atomic club	1736.797034966963
5944. until	moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 the us and	uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere	as the russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still	coming down	5983.04179637378
5945. as it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds	up in the human body; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu	virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies	3350.2485212499887
5946. the effect of	radiation is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding generations	1418.8531566643028
5947. so while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history	is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the	west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical	and irresponsible threat	4044.0222543418336
5948. shock dismay and foreboding for future	generations were legitimate reactions; a holier-than-thou sermon was	not	1641.4423146197503
5949. on october 19 after the soviets had detonated at least	20 nuclear devices ambassador stevenson warned the un general	assembly that this country in self protection might have	to resume above-ground tests	3461.8236882275096
5950. more recently the chairman of the atomic	energy commission dr glenn t seaborg admitted	to a news conference in las vegas nevada that the us might	fall behind russia if the	soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain	6445.3226235163165
5951. the	trial balloons are afloat	14.96413478836153
5952. all of which makes it more imperative	than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood	2581.107735810372
5953. but for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of science's	worst-marked channels full of tricky currents and unknown	depths	1874.9853159053441
5954. the scientists in and out of government do not agree on some	of the most vital points at least publicly	2825.906480041876
5955. on the one hand the public	health service declared as recently as october 26 that present	radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots do not warrant	undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive	substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the	us	4894.713480210726
5956. but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles	will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations	and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united	states	5614.148623410876
5957. then it added: it is not possible to determine	how extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people will	be affected	2316.08433318659
5958. having hedged its bets in this way phs	apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination	after all: at present radiation levels and even at somewhat	higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will	be affected	6806.456430468492
5959. then to conclude on an indeterminate note: nevertheless	if fallout increased substantially or remained high for	a long time it would become far more important as a potential health	hazard in this country and throughout the world	3970.6676414075364
5960. dr linus	pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous	whether you choose to agree with him or not	3290.4426009610625
5961. long-lived carbon-14	from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal	or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations	and between 200000 and one million human beings now living would have	their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia	6814.495540612479
5962. most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout	is concentrating	946.0501871359717
5963. pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from	the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be	too high but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility	4980.359896238044
5964. the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due	in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from	which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn	2978.1147046744145
5965. but more than one conscientious	researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion	of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout	has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem	5799.997217348919
5966. its	dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe	national security requires further testing	1577.5597854010648
5967. an illustration of this	attitude is found in john a mccone's letter to dr thomas	lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new	republic	4478.606454725783
5968. to this day the atomic energy commission shies	away from discussing the health aspects of fallout	1258.9971083803496
5969. a recent study	on radiation exposure by the aec's division of biology and	medicine stated: the question of the biological effect h of radiation	doses is not considered herein	4668.510836968942
5970. of course the aec	is in a bind now	261.95719802157527
5971. if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers	of fallout it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests	3053.1376836609506
5972. so the commission's announcements of the new soviet shots have	been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually	left vague	2593.807908114185
5973. now of course that the russians are the	nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s	when the us was testing in the atmosphere	4658.290508517967
5974. the prevailing	official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good	for you might not be much worse than a bad cold	2589.39245668402
5975. after a nuclear blast	one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had	to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof	4651.559629114179
5976. things	aren't that simple anymore	14.870959138440682
5977. yet if washington gets too indignant	about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork	if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count	5010.508823222058
5978. as of october 25 the aec	had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series 12 of them in a megaton	range including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons	; and	president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported	3864.5502246854676
5979. assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot	estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons a conservative computation	is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60	megatons	5809.228553757375
5980. some government scientists say privately that the figure	probably is closer to 80 megatons and that the full 50-megaton bomb	that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated	2851.5110879830186
5981. if the new	soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian	tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a	fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far	5468.084694838904
5982. to this must be added the	90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the	atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that	began in november 1958	3652.652982534193
5983. one of the inescapable realities	of the cold war is that is has thrust upon the west a wholly new	and historically unique set of moral dilemmas	4294.7170801388465
5984. the first dilemma was	the morality of nuclear warfare itself	375.09807480040456
5985. that dilemma is as much with	us as ever	390.9214363238778
5986. the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear	testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present	series of soviet tests	2733.1761192395866
5987. when this second dilemma first	became	obvious- during the mid to late '50's- the united states	appeared to have three choices	3042.407953646403
5988. it could have unilaterally abandoned	further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations	1417.1005448404885
5989. it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds	that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist	world domination	3905.8577641385323
5990. or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation-	some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security	1872.1488527904905
5991. this	third choice was in fact made	140.1530973725731
5992. with the resumption of soviet	testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks however the	hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken	2730.431490603492
5993. once	again the united states must choose	140.83536736999136
5994. and once again the	choices	are much the same	261.88635410456203
5995. only this time around the conditions are different	and the choice is far harder	1422.567771259783
5996. the first choice abandoning tests	entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely	be exploited by the russians	1886.1320157614587
5997. the second choice full testing has	become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have	already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere	3279.793760885875
5998. the third choice negotiation	presupposes as russian behavior demonstrates a great deal	of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable	1887.9227978823444
5999. we take the	position however that the third choice still remains the only sane	one open to us	2353.701159273508
6000. it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice	and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable	2188.8299128125377
6001. its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice; one which should	it fail will not have contaminated the conscience	3047.5773246454073
6002. that is the	contamination we most fear	94.05162337328477
6003. leaving aside the choice of unilateral	cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question	must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part	would not be a good choice	5621.454241989889
6004. for that is the one an increasingly large	number of prominent americans are now proposing	1101.5792885235085
6005. in particular governor	nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as	anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests	3049.718419255915
6006. speaking	recently in miami governor rockefeller said that to assure	the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet	tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests	3760.9584870540616
6007. taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be	unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the united	states is to do confidently and firmly not what is popular	but what is right	6442.933693468278
6008. what was missing in the governor's	argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would	enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable	to what is right	3763.171818436913
6009. the possibility as he asserted that the russians	may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests	does not supply the needed ethical premise- unless of course we have	unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken	as a moral demand	7215.539931005024
6010. besides the lack of an adequate ethical	dimension to the governor's case one can ask seriously whether our	lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons	is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary	4140.525560026092
6011. recent statements	by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the	contrary assured us that our lead is very great	3049.2985999624952
6012. unless the administration	and the defense department have been deceiving us the facts	do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric	testing	2732.6649804952513
6013. it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption	of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary	and even justifiable	3261.3833208119927
6014. but a resumption does not seem justifiable now	167.26258780602012
6015. what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination	of the atmosphere by the soviet tests has radically increased our	own moral obligations	3906.7701982852877
6016. we now have to think not only of our national	security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests	we might undertake	2717.0178632100324
6017. this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded	or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even	of the evil of communism	3902.643208836724
6018. too often in the past russian	tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part	1418.3186962882105
6019. there ought	to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless	of what russia does	2805.0275160867322
6020. the refusal to resume atmospheric testing	would be a good start	504.4892255497356
6021. when his holiness	pope john 23 first called for an ecumenical council and at the	same time voiced his yearning for christian unity the enthusiasm	among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate	5158.615226022134
6022. with good	reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom	782.6606586553492
6023. but	as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became	known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides	4095.3180535963365
6024. the council we now know will concern itself directly only with	the internal affairs of the church	1423.5110873415438
6025. as it has turned out however	the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of	hope in the second were both wrong responses	3906.772377525643
6026. two things have happened	in recent months to bring the council into perspective: each provides	a basis for renewed hope and joy	2189.3477323061816
6027. first of all it is now	known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church	as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity	4116.616977135562
6028. far from	being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believes that a	revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism	in the best possible light	3357.8060746199653
6029. equally significant pope john	has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian	disunity	1646.4398478004036
6030. a major aim of the council will be to remove as	far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity	2601.1321482520552
6031. secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the	pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very	much alive and growing within the church	4831.603520769769
6032. the establishment by the	holy father of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in	1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern	2311.273948601459
6033. the designation of	five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches	assembly in new delhi as official observers reverses the church's	earlier stand	3902.14240472955
6034. the public appeal by the new vatican secretary	of state cardinal cicognani for renewed efforts toward eastern	and western reunion was still another remarkable act	2598.308591096953
6035. nor can one	forget pope john's unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury	1174.7463785983082
6036. augustin cardinal bea the director of the secretariate	for christian unity has expressed as directly as anyone the	new spirit that pervades the church's stance toward the protestant	and orthodox churches	3352.674150922687
6037. noting all the difficulties that stand in	the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone	3030.0185129954416
6038. for discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts would	show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without	thinking of the omnipotence of god the irresistible efficacy of	prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit	4465.283387714109
6039. can any christian fail to respond to these words	393.8473714201126
6040. the administration's official budget review which estimates	a 6	263.97516239551743
6041. 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isn't	making anyone happy	1187.4042294610363
6042. certainly it isn't making the president happy	and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget	got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever	he can and how he hopes to do better next year	4390.156251551065
6043. we sympathize	with mr kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review	doesn't please us either although for very different reasons	3683.1649750582
6044. furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying	than reassuring	787.3841835643007
6045. in the first place a large part of the	discrepancy between president eisenhower's estimate of a 1	2117.664144684288
6046. 5 billion	dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost	seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president's	farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor	3755.559009018888
6047. the eisenhower	budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and	yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received	2791.1171433927666
6048. the	rest of the deficit is also easily understood	264.28539257666347
6049. four billion dollars	of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated	by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration quite	apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere	5014.701126201513
6050. four hundred	million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a	responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower	1889.3185782261965
6051. the farm program	will cost an additional 1	252.5398073535332
6052. 5 billion because of unusual weather	factors the food for peace program and other new measures	1253.8927673606443
6053. anti-recession	programs- aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed	areas- account for only 900 million of the 6	2824.4262572356
6054. our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy	programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard	to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures	3545.379491971137
6055. and yet mr kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents	of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and	economizing	3479.914737814569
6056. we wish the president would remember that fiscal	responsibility was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election	1717.1302405898641
6057. the party that won used to say something about a new frontier	962.3140682575009
6058. introduction of the dialogue principle	proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting	of the catholic association for international peace in washington	the last weekend in october	2858.1239817796804
6059. two of the principal addresses were delivered	by prominent protestants and when the speaker was a catholic	one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious	persuasion	4652.27513297116
6060. several effects were immediately evident	14.818609920222944
6061. sessions	devoted to ethics and foreign policy trends moral principle	and political judgment christian ethics in the cold	war and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this	procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves	6032.102177758186
6062. usually	questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker	or discussion leader	948.6840446478076
6063. in the earlier sessions there was plentiful	discussion on the natural law which dr william v o'brien	of georgetown university advanced as the basis for widely acceptable	ethical judgments on foreign policy	5187.553418961868
6064. that aristotelean-thomistic	principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the	participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself	2318.979377674988
6065. speakers	declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps	by some other name	1638.7263555883521
6066. a lebanese moslem told about its existence and	application in the islamic tradition as the divine law while a	caip member who has been working in close association	with delegates of the new un nations told of its widespread recognition	on the african continent	4522.332003482608
6067. the impression was unmistakable	that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning	generality with a certain objective existence	3493.686985971245
6068. another question	that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself	503.0698513777792
6069. the stimulus from	the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences	was undeniable	1182.8415168260558
6070. it was expected that the comparison of different	approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's	positions and better comprehension of one's own	2731.6574098227957
6071. but a realization	that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed	and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions	to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political	issues	6050.509002493023
6072. everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question	559.4500537090973
6073. i was searching	for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy	643.4806058598473
6074. i never	found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted	they were almost all members of the official family who presumably	harbor official thoughts	4633.603429861716
6075. but i questioned also professional soldiers	who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy	irredentism	1412.1205701322292
6076. their answer was: it can be done and we will do it	963.9954705494614
6077. and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang	kai-shek: in america i said practically no one	believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland	3360.6982897669195
6078. what	evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government	proposes to do just that and that it can be done	3678.847460558437
6079. he smiled	0.20041515
6080. also at a british bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine	questions	1641.3950804999386
6081. i recalled sympathetically the duke's complaint in browning's	he smiled and said a word	or two to the interpreter who turned to me the president wonders	where you are going after you leave taipei	3677.1505080330594
6082. that i smarted	is a royal rebuff if ever there was one	961.6661270247794
6083. i answered the routine	question about my itinerary rather coolly	374.33144020625025
6084. chiang spoke again	this	time at greater length	249.02039744120435
6085. the president says the translator	came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because	he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia and	that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question	4466.319289489814
6086. he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound	determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return	is feasible he would merely sound redundant	5467.777011352862
6087. so you yourself must	seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions	945.5825502471793
6088. any information	we have here in taiwan is at your disposal	749.5593731950518
6089. what are the relevant data	14.932464129684044
6090. for every person on taiwan there	are sixty in mainland china	749.4525919028003
6091. if the raw population figures are	crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as	to suppose that poland might liberate russia	2713.1538630978253
6092. relative military manpower	0.30041514999999996
6093. less than 60-1 but at least 6-1	93.44010476131658
6094. the estimates vary widely	on the strength of the chinese army	754.221749923671
6095. the armed	forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450000 though	a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated	2180.9643368370375
6096. skill	0.30041514999999996
6097. training	0.20041515
6098. morale	0.30041514999999996
6099. it is generally conceded that the formosan air force	is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained	2197.6953485410736
6100. the morale	is very high	22.420464513284955
6101. even so it adds up to impossible odds except	that the question arises on whose side would the mainland chinese	army fight	2175.699242507255
6102. the miserable people of china the largest cast	ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves	resist overtly	2820.877205821195
6103. they think perforce of physical survival:	everything else is secondary	375.49164272346286
6104. but the army which mao continues to feed	well where are its sympathies	1188.1524749998339
6105. the psychological strategists in	taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in china over	thousands of years	1566.1267284791747
6106. it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist	depersonalization	751.5034936677499
6107. every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives	who are close to starvation	786.1620707811946
6108. the soldiers themselves cannot stage	a successful rebellion it is assumed: but will their discontent	spread to the officer class	2832.669083616164
6109. the immediate families of the generals	and the admirals are well fed: a despot does not economize on his	generals	1894.4241640298583
6110. but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews	393.658567595397
6111. their privations	are almost beyond endurance	43.58154455377622
6112. in behalf of what	4.4054063640449455
6113. leninism-marxism	as understood by exegete mao	43.50180065382766
6114. to whom will the generals stay	loyal	141.25275647593202
6115. there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they	would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out	on the farm	2853.500619606628
6116. it is another question whether they- or a single	general off in a corner of china secure for a few	days at least from instant retaliation- will defy the party	4837.11237815841
6117. but	the disposition to rebel is most definitely there	260.2412895376331
6118. but there	must be a catalytic pressure	141.46849327919475
6119. the military in taiwan believe that	the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal	1411.3579081293606
6120. the first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural	poverty for years	1189.568295611546
6121. the family is largely broken up; and where it	is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is	enormous	2602.747852467933
6122. for it is the family that in china has always provided social	security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out members of	the clan	3703.564167039497
6123. now the government must do that; but the government is	left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained	2179.6936483524287
6124. thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of	social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and	created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems	of social security	4851.942238789001
6125. the second mistake is tibet	14.925640849227108
6126. tibet has	historically served china as a buffer state	394.7407878687262
6127. a friendly state sometimes	only semi-independent but never hostile	261.28098062197154
6128. china never tried to	integrate tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions	1182.4578361304234
6129. red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed	1091.348632857876
6130. tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult	394.97821831929195
6131. tibet may bleed	china as algeria is bleeding france	261.95288753279436
6132. these continuing	pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china	in a heightening state of tension	2586.483037520251
6133. the imposition of yet another pressure	a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap	1412.675939249495
6134. the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men	393.4486473575712
6135. they know that	they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control	788.262345817667
6136. first	and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime	1179.105629383313
6137. on these they feel they can rely	94.18030307721715
6138. secondly they depend on america's	moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives	965.1683108104359
6139. they	hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest we will	receive the opportunity gladly	1265.4978677932645
6140. i remarked jocularly to the president	that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite	a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd	day	5166.613318897002
6141. he affected not to understand my point	93.40575888215642
6142. but he-	and all of china- wear the scars of american indecisiveness and	he knows what an uncertain ally we are	3033.2668268887296
6143. we have been grand to formosa	itself- lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support	for the offshore islands	2314.214704540599
6144. but our outlook has been and continues to	be defensive	561.7214962117573
6145. a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr	kennedy's views on the world struggle	1109.3591468319746
6146. the free chinese know that	the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike	2369.6689251088883
6147. there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized	force for liberation	1256.4254652217683
6148. the moment of truth is the moment of crisis	392.82144307570854
6149. during the slow buildup	the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details	fine words strutting gestures	2036.8404192312842
6150. the crisis burns these suddenly	away	65.31272051296926
6151. there the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look	644.0796763827569
6152. new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked	bones	563.6836339283984
6153. a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for	a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure	verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies	3326.422368710157
6154. before memory	too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen	2119.6837594454782
6155. the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of	public men at many levels	1255.7114892491602
6156. one knows better now who has bone and	who	has jelly in his spine	1408.6777081156156
6157. but i am here concerned more with policy	than with men	502.5856493861896
6158. public men come and go but great issues of policy remain	752.7513928288525
6159. now everyone knows- or knew in the week of december 10-	that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy	2026.4936548027054
6160. the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful	orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most	pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations-	the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship	between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved	7542.193957707217
6161. of course the	fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations	790.3921206024846
6162. but	in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was	in reality the principal	2115.7098118230138
6163. the moment simultaneously revealed that	in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato	allies to the entire western community	2442.8895195790496
6164. by our policy the west was-	is- split	251.3157364585571
6165. but the key revelation is not new	93.39615601372606
6166. the controlling	pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november	1956	1180.584713940217
6167. it reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis	exposes the reality: in cuba last spring	; at the peaks of the nuclear	test and the berlin cycles; in relation to laos algeria south	africa; right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally	linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana	3944.16829658209
6168. reveal	this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:	under prevailing policy the u s can take the initiative	against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left	5332.572175494997
6169. it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form	of regime what particular issue	1567.6018509864134
6170. the u s cannot take the	initiative against the left	562.0118844515985
6171. there is even some question whether	the u s can any longer defend itself against an initiative	by the left	1884.9380335683195
6172. we can attack tshombe but not gigenza	139.6981808944276
6173. no	matter that gizenga is moscow's man in the congo	374.31633032396826
6174. no matter that	it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men	1633.1172803565817
6175. no matter	that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western	interests in africa	1251.882607228384
6176. unified you don't protect western security by first removing	we can force	britain and france out of the suez but we cannot so much as try	to force the russian tanks back from budapest	5497.539089066195
6177. we can mass our	fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros	790.2155003879595
6178. we can	vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule	in angola but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall-	much less give the simple order to push the wall down	5968.249914213049
6179. we officially	receive the anti-french moscow-allied algerian	fln	but we denounce the pro-europe anti-communist oas as criminal	1411.9978634848421
6180. in the very week of our war against katanga we make a $133	million grant to kwame nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity	with the communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into	a totalitarian dictatorship	6189.219208891317
6181. as our planes land the war materiel that	kills pro-western katangans we stand supinely bleating while nehru's	troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato	ally portugal	2968.9540683872547
6182. what explains this uni-directional paralysis	22.27579975720042
6183. it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes	the frame of our international- and in some degree our domestic-	policy	2314.4863625409757
6184. the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not	invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and	more active	3276.599410538259
6185. most immediately relevant to these	episodes in goa katanga and ghana as to the suez-hungary crisis	before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama	is the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america	4141.783465621024
6186. from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy	on the uncommitted nations	especially on those whose leaders make the most noise- nehru tito	nkrumah sukarno betancourt etc	4851.034002519493
6187. our chief aim becomes that	of finding favor in neutralist eyes	501.0438775085119
6188. if we grasp this orientation	as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned	becomes intelligible	2816.249899177682
6189. and it becomes clear why in general we cannot	take the initiative against the left	1097.622951087165
6190. to write a play the dramatist once	needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the	craft to develop it	3469.1286428582994
6191. nowadays more and more all he needs is someone	else's book	504.91307678797875
6192. to get started he does not scan the world about him;	he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists	3067.936468025909
6193. so	far this season broadway's premieres have included twice as many	best from	abroad	943.8794605934493
6194. which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel a death	in the family; the wall awkwardly based on the john hersey	novel; advise and consent lively but shallow theater drawn	from the mountainously detailed bestseller; face of a hero	based on a pierre boulle novel	7350.254991794801
6195. the only original works	attempting	to reach any stature: tennessee williams' disappointing domestic	comedy period of adjustment and arthur laurents' clever	but empty invitation to a march	2867.266502959236
6196. clearly the most provocative	plays are all imported originals- a taste of honey by britain's	young shelagh delaney; becket	by france's jean anouilh; the hostage by ireland's	brendan behan	4658.503841140842
6197. among the musicals camelot came	from t h white's the once and future king and novels	were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do	re mi	3119.89044384334
6198. wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals	but pretty bad leaving top honors again to an import- the	jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce	4082.177125948773
6199. the only other works	at least technically original were dreary farces- send me no	flowers under the yum-yum tree critic's choice	2035.7631673444757
6200. in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival	broadway is not even adapting books but reconverting old movies		1477.313856092196
6201. originals	are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily	bad	500.0282736527881
6202. some memorable plays have been drawn from books notably life	with father and diary of anne frank	2109.740212212974
6203. and particularly in the	musical field adaptations have long been the rule from die fledermaus	and the merry widow to oklahoma! and my fair	lady	2598.5137740286746
6204. as critic walter kerr points out: adaptations	so long as they are good still qualify as creative	2112.2569369844564
6205. and other defenders	invariably argue that after all shakespeare and moliere were	adapters too	942.5455802411825
6206. the difference is that the masters took the bare frame	of a plot and filled it with their own world; most modern adapters	totally accept the world of a book squeeze it dry of life and add only	one contribution of their own: stage technique	6967.954093840254
6207. the most	frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports	is increasing production expense- producers cannot afford to take chances	2177.4140067675653
6208. but that explanation is only partly true	142.18598765542473
6209. off-broadway where	production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly	more original	944.3771788624283
6210. laudably enough it is offering classics and off-beat	imports but last week only one us original was on the boards	robert d hock's stunning civil war work borak	4485.779313633016
6211. the	real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of us playwrights	633.8971295079212
6212. he: come	with me to the casbah	139.85488825067188
6213. she: by subway or cab	14.99739710153815
6214. that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan	as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and	eighth avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like	arabian nights grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american	inpost of belly dancing	7251.802266846903
6215. several more will open soon	14.78753855438833
6216. their	burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street	burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always	familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis	5150.992589201811
6217. the belly boites with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted	ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek	and turkish families	2332.8981692137427
6218. customers often bring their children; between	performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take	the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces	3509.2179965799432
6219. except for the odd	uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor the people watch in	calm absorption	1580.560342056676
6220. small shirt-sleeved	orchestras play in 24 or 44 time	using guitars violins and more alien instruments with names that	would open sesame: the oud grandfather of the lute; the darbuka	a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass; the def	a low-pitched tambourine	7069.780476818805
6221. the girls sit quietly with the musicians wearing	prim dresses or plain secretarial shifts until it is time to	go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem	3669.915526052978
6222. if a dancer is good she suggests purely	and	superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny- the continuum	of mankind	3047.6883215389926
6223. but a great many of what variety calls the	cooch terpers are considerably less cosmic than that	1411.2138219846724
6224. each dancer	follows the ancient oriental pattern- she glides sideways with	shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing	and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips	and away to the far end of the room	6439.199209500508
6225. this is done at varying speeds	ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli	meaning	to the fastest ecstatic karshilama		1222.5696411572817
6226. the new york dancers are highly eclectic varying	the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends	or floor crawls	3044.174664526479
6227. but they do not strip	14.819185379028387
6228. the striptease is crass;	the belly dance leaves more to the imagination	963.5360269767987
6229. when a dancer	does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills- although	the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping	the tips into the dancers' costumes	3242.021640027456
6230. with tips the girls average	between $150 and $200 a week depending on basic salary	1646.9131769224362
6231. although	they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes	proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy	2601.232824691667
6232. all over the country belly clubs have never	been bigger especially in detroit boston and chicago and even	in small towns; one of the best dancers a turkish girl named semra	works at a roadhouse outside bristol conn	6081.351578904858
6233. the girls are kept	booked and moving by several agents notably voluble black-bearded	murat somay a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central	abdomen	2861.1901390386947
6234. he can offer nine turkish girls plans to import at least	15 more	1181.2436034075151
6235. but a great many of the dancers are more or less native	644.5968789620493
6236. sometimes	they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted	by lebanese and syrians in the us where they dance with	just as	few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs	5004.545010508943
6237. as the	girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting	pot has never bubbled more intriguingly	1887.891702162958
6238. some manhattan examples:	jemela 23 seems hong kong oriental	but has a spanish father and an indian mother was born in america	and educated at	holy cross academy and textile high school says	she learned belly dancing at family picnics	6315.5073114364895
6239. serene	23 was born in budapest and raised in manhattan	374.6492238495981
6240. daughter	of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance she is one of the few	really beautiful girls in the new york casbah with dark eyes and dark	waist-length hair the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe	glimmering body	6587.363977632599
6241. many belly dancers are married but serene is one	of the few who will admit it	1253.5894582035978
6242. marlene	25 a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends	in paris now lives on manhattan's west side is about the best	belly dancer working the casbah loves it so much that she dances on	her day off	6344.640051346642
6243. she has the small highly developed body of a prime athlete	and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex	2029.3098041021142
6244. leila 25 is a greenwich village painter of	persianesque miniatures	who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles	2816.257799084495
6245. a graduate of hollywood high school she likes to imagine herself	as she takes the floor a village girl coming in to a festival	2476.3001944972
6246. gloria circa 30 who was born	in italy and once did chorus work in toronto has been around	longer than most of the others wistfully remembers the old days	when	we used to get the seamen from the ships you know with big turtleneck	sweaters and handkerchiefs and all	7333.390796770563
6247. but the ships are very slow	now and we don't get so many sailors any more	1257.683395880539
6248. the uptown crowd	has moved in and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck	sweater for a button-down collar	3272.2275350393843
6249. of the handful of painters that austria	has produced in the 20th century only one oskar kokoschka is widely	known in the us	2337.311000457713
6250. this state of unawareness may not last	much longer	387.9944843283361
6251. for ten years a small group of european and us	critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian	expressionist	egon schiele who died 42 years ago at the age of 28	3446.398082065921
6252. the	critics' campaign finally inspired the first major us exhibit	of schiele's works	1180.3378558431773
6253. the show has been to boston and manhattan	will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis	1097.6733997545448
6254. last week it opened	at the j b speed museum in louisville at the very moment	that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau	gallery in los angeles	5325.250605519434
6255. schiele's paintings are anything	but pleasant	43.47841472363622
6256. his people are angular and knobby-knuckled	sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened	959.4673124330524
6257. his colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes	seem swallowed in gloom	1101.833458986195
6258. but he painted some of the boldest and	most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century	the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its	fascination	5659.332453607045
6259. the son of a railway stationmaster	schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town	of tulln 14 miles northwest of vienna	2454.105812504843
6260. he was an emotional lonely	boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely	any schoolwork	2793.541077092069
6261. when he was 15 his parents finally allowed him to attend	classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna	1879.7439094764547
6262. even there he	did not last for long	248.00370738876455
6263. cried one professor after a few months of student	schiele's tantrums and rebellion: the devil himself must	have defecated you into my classroom!   for a while his	work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists and by the patterned	mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt then the dean of austrian	art	4953.832596674896
6264. gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own-	and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter	2361.549828582331
6265. his pictures were	roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen	in vienna	1266.8962153533416
6266. he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and	jailed for 24 days- the first three of which he spent desperately trying	to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle	5145.343100269716
6267. for years he	wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars was even driven	to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna's gutters	2027.905690596166
6268. drafted	into	the austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a vienna	billet went on painting	1894.5816194067124
6269. it was not until the last year of his	life that he had his first moneymaking show	1412.8671171414196
6270. the unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the	only	thing that kept the public at bay: his view of the world was one of	almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbid-minded	vienna	6316.016935587698
6271. he was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of	old age and the tyranny of lust	1580.1669410180914
6272. the children he painted were almost	always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness	and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were stringy	contorted and strangely pathetic	4963.038466827775
6273. the subject he liked most was the	female body which he painted in every state- naked half-dressed	muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a	bed or locked in an embrace	3868.124807422732
6274. the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of	the soviet communist party is that it was surprising- perhaps	quite as much in its own way as the twentieth congress of 1956 which	ended with that famous secret report on stalin	6408.275607279147
6275. the publication	last july of the party's draft program- that blueprint for	the transition to communism- had led the uninitiated to suppose	that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis	of the khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in	fact been current over the last three or four years	in all theoretical party	journals	5461.950208528558
6276. these never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of marx	and lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment	of a communist society had now under khrushchev become	an immediate and tangible reality	6051.094668229764
6277. it seems that khrushchev	himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution	to marxist doctrine with his draft program	his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was in fact very largely		2864.4353008771104
6278. he and other soviet leaders	responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward	some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship	of the proletariat by an all people's state and also of having	laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of	the whole hierarchy of soviets starting with the supreme soviet itself	8205.440923689244
6279. their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at	bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct	and active part in running the country	3112.094128196243
6280. also elections would be	more democratic; there might even be two or more candidates for voters	to choose from	2600.1260897802313
6281. no doubt there was still a lot in the draft	program- and in khrushchev's speech- which left many points	obscure	1881.8120496888685
6282. was it the party's intention for example to abolish gradually	the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning	sovkhozes ie state farms		2362.6135802514923
6283. if one follows the reports of the	congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty	in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this	matter	4998.532798053402
6284. the draft program was interesting in other respects	too	261.9464182118351
6285. it contained for example a number of curious admissions about	the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no old-age pensions	no paid holidays; they still benefit far less than the other 50	per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet	union so greatly prides itself on being	7535.981888303871
6286. over all these	fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;	and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures	of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the ordinary	people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism	is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food	5316.819860871617
6287. would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry	141.70231003252292
6288. this was something	on which k himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept	on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible	for agricultural production	3101.458617802543
6289. and as we know the virgin lands are	not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped	1897.4940827375299
6290. one cannot	but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev's	agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the	big surprises provided by this congress- the obsessive harping on the	crimes and misdeeds of the anti-party group- molotov malenkov	kaganovich and others- including the eighty-year-old marshal	voroshilov	5152.516208403378
6291. molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds	of sins- especially with wanting to cut down free public services	to increase rents and fares; in fact with having been against all	the more popular features of the khrushchev welfare state	6437.929529943249
6292. the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one	side of the story: what in the secret councils of the kremlin	molotov had really proposed we just don't know and he has had	no chance to reply	4316.711916689872
6293. but one cannot escape the suspicion	that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated	anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not	inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on	vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the	transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy	8385.336933306884
6294. the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful	competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this	congress	2044.5400103399909
6295. mikoyan declared:   molotov altogether rejects	the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the	state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and	to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war	6424.575422810346
6296. his views in	fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence	who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed	peace	3203.079936882536
6297. one cannot help wondering whether molotov	and the rest of the anti-party group are not being used as china's	whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers	4096.56274629701
6298. for	something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese	relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated	1882.7234795132986
6299. the effect of chou en-lai's clash with khrushchev together	with the everlasting attacks on molotov + co has shifted the whole	attention of the world including that of the soviet people from	the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese	conflict	4963.5179086057215
6300. not only as we know did chou en-lai publicly treat	khrushchev's attack on albania as something that we cannot consider	as a serious marxist-leninist approach to the problem	but	the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to	khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on	5099.21260088669
6301. it is extremely	doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists	could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends	3877.618779110472
6302. the big question is whether in the name of a restored chinese-soviet	solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians	to present their humble apologies to khrushchev- or get rid of	enver hoxa	3666.4897489781483
6303. these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy	incident can now be closed	1889.296249284703
6304. but albania is merely a symptom	of a real malaise between china and russia	941.0760232732064
6305. khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable	decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence	and would like above all the berlin and german problems	to be settled peacefully; he knows that he was never more popular than	at the time of the russo-american honeymoon of 1959	7432.757455989324
6306. but	it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere- in the	first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby	which i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago exists on	the quiet inside the party	4298.531816293895
6307. to these people solidarity and unity with	china should be the real basis of russia's future policy	2110.468439270541
6308. and the	chinese as the albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that	khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the west	2341.2591610376835
6309. the fact that china	should be supported by north korea and north	vietnam is highly indicative	1873.029825792058
6310. and one cannot but wonder whether	marshal malinovsky	who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but	also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against	the west wasn't trying to keep the chinese quiet	3858.9734080560347
6311. and this	brings us inevitably to the 30-	or 50-megaton bomb	756.40622024315
6312. was not this dropped	primarily in order to appease the chinese- especially after	khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the west in canceling	the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31	2987.175446430773
6313. what	does it all add up to	140.1663928962618
6314. indications are that khrushchev	favor peaceful coexistence and	the maintenance of the status quo in	the world	1427.753429636066
6315. the chinese north vietnamese and north koreans on	the other hand feel that militarily russia is strong enough to support	them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark	on before long: with china attacking formosa and the north koreans	and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective	countries	7781.90183471113
6316. perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult	position than any since 1957 when the anti-party group nearly	liquidated him	1728.4382367931205
6317. he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with	any internal opposition; but if he is up against china's crusading	spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing	choice in his life	6175.771355747591
6318. he may support china; he	may break with china	or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions	in persuading china to be patient	2571.5477521721177
6319. the next days may show where things	stand	250.2345264422955
6320. on a misty sunday morning last month a small band of militant	anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field	about fifteen miles east of here	2987.4845374322877
6321. eleven men a woman and a teen-age	boy tramped over cold damp fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour	field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare	3906.3466645550993
6322. to the average	american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday	night tv movie	1422.1692071617015
6323. but to the minutemen this is a serious business	395.0575000180571
6324. they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death	struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy	1733.235571305792
6325. they feel	that world war 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves	up as a last line of defense against the communist advance	3897.563760401762
6326. their national leader robert bolivar depugh of norborne	mo says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best	suited to defeat the red onslaught	2465.7210282771844
6327. in their maneuvers last month	they wore world war 2 camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded	m-1 rifles	2597.8343159283
6328. the maneuvers were held in secret	after a regional seminar for the minutemen held in nearby shiloh	ill had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had	arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville ill	and seized four operative weapons including a browning machine gun	two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle	5303.529101414897
6329. undismayed	by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli's	home at 6:30 am the next day put on their uniforms	and headed for a farm several miles away	5177.3750626700285
6330. a 60 mm mortar and a	57 mm	recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along	1257.5391712837652
6331. the mortar	was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated	1183.0641315750315
6332. after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war	2 army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing	squeezed between a long low ridge and a creek-filled gully	3776.566733004901
6333. here	the two leaders depugh and lauchli hastened to put the group	through its paces	1643.8304045670818
6334. the minutemen were instructed in the use	of terrain for concealment	500.5729180099649
6335. they were shown how to advance against an	enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge	1417.22558985358
6336. they practiced movement behind a	smoke screen laid by smoke grenades; and they attempted a skirmish	line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment	2474.355273014457
6337. eleven dummy	rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar	shooting	1402.2532408139475
6338. mrs depugh the mother of five children and an	active member of her husband's organization participated in all the	exercises	1873.6957419830367
6339. there were no casualties but the guerrillas	admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called	a halt at 9 am to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane	4825.228565784078
6340. i would like to add one more practical reform	to those mentioned by russell kirk dec 16	1415.48401038129
6341. it has to do	with teachers' salaries and tenure	392.52889172687765
6342. next september after receiving	a degree from yale's master of arts in teaching program	i will be teaching somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present	shortage of mathematics teachers	3203.153966774198
6343. i will also be underpaid	22.124864759303037
6344. the	amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers	937.8871871897964
6345. teaching	is at present a sellers' market; as a result buyers the	public must be satisfied with second-rate teachers	2601.6289225116607
6346. but this is not	the real problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually	paid on the basis of time served rather than quality	2859.3424203047357
6347. hence all	teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of	years are paid the same salary	3043.1017574678217
6348. i am firmly convinced that considering	the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly	overpaid	1719.1152063146633
6349. it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect	any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how much the public	will pay for shoddy performance	4282.038404398932
6350. the only hope which good teachers	have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight	of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them	2978.017629500171
6351. the only hope which	the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis	of merit rather than tenure	3469.955438379361
6352. here as in all sectors of the economy	quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual	to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses	3226.3457562564263
6353. of initiative	on the eve of the great debate on the proposal	to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions	which could practically bring us into the atlantic community	we should face the alternatives on this proposition	6341.481651951582
6354. what we will	be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective	which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which	we now operate	3093.2165400984463
6355. without this power we lay open any american industry	which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy	to the will of others	3677.291415580944
6356. it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct	our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we	conduct our political affairs	2836.652815128315
6357. i disagree with mr burnham's position on the common market	nov 18 as a desirable organization for us to join	2814.2460191814384
6358. for him to	ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of	this kind is difficult to understand	1728.8397072647651
6359. the pressure for our entry to	the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated	trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or	garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background	6210.941137332556
6360. the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing	to those who do not see its relation to political and legal	as well as economic self-rule	3332.406809293948
6361. in entering this union we will be surrendering	most if not all of our economic autonomy to international	bodies such as the atlantic institute or the oecd	imf and others	4847.2801968519325
6362. to think that we can merely	relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political	or legal autonomy is wishful thinking	2037.5788350501582
6363. if it is not enough that	all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join	this market i refer you to an article in the new york times'	magazine section nov 12 1961 by mr eric johnston	entitled we must join the common market	6993.127929303095
6364. he says: it	has swept aside petty nationalisms age-old rivalries and worn-out	customs	794.6065696352282
6365. referring to britain he says we see a nation that	traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its	economy placing this authority in continental hands	4457.078361523853
6366. h since	the goal of our international planners is a world government this atlantic	community would mark a giant step in that direction for once	american economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question	of time	4042.943626172945
6367. frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense	they have us over a barrel	2131.042751207089
6368. listen to what mr johnston has to	say: consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict	1259.0714757095654
6369. h we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports	we need	1406.7266635621522
6370. we would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline	widespread unemployment	503.1148714252239
6371. but the solution to this dilemma	is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community	or economic empire but merely what libertarians like henry	hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years: an	end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry	and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry	7997.168870072544
6372. create a	free market here give us a sound debt-free money system and we'll	compete with anyone europe and asia combined	2031.9551213829095
6373. in short get this	governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about	european competition or communism either	3040.3265628220242
6374. if we want to preserve	our sovereignty this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international	planning board	2023.190204465381
6375. if we go into this common market we might	just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees connally	amendments or for that matter conservatism in general	4101.494414287159
6376. we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided	discussion of the atlantic common market which nr will	be continuing in our pages	2855.297178393416
6377. the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the	world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning november	27 anticipating by two days the announcement of the us	treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed	6444.402734563768
6378. and the army	in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two	years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in	any further army reserve activities	3094.9222497007795
6379. now more than five years later	i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier	2121.09525664562
6380. but	in spite of this i at present a man 31 years of age and a college	professor have been recalled by direction of the president	to report on november 25th to fort devens massachusetts for another	twelve months of active duty as an sp 4		3773.2308523628562
6381. today seven years after the date of my initial induction	as a draftee i am assistant professor of philosophy and science	at st michael's college	3916.546541433351
6382. for after leaving the army in 1956	i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college	and then at the university of toronto	2602.3388717966473
6383. this time added to that which	i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 makes	a total of twenty-two years of education	4056.689319523037
6384. the possibility	of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american	has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys	2978.996382077504
6385. with	this no loyal citizen can quarrel	140.829751902592
6386. however it seems axiomatic that	the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably	equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably	causes	2861.5107347877038
6387. in my own case i submit that such reasonable and fair	exercise is woefully lacking	1645.75245814246
6388. taken back into the army now as an	sp 4 i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am	1890.1485032270593
6389. wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from	at this late date it is	impossible for st michael's college to find a suitable replacement	for me	4989.279321681879
6390. even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal	life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very	compelling reason- i cannot help looking around at the black leather	jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns	of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone	mad	5626.065491398004
6391. in news broadcasts i consistently	hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army	referred to as mercenaries	2365.7835775768203
6392. this confuses me no end	14.802964585897774
6393. if the hessian	troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for	england in the 1770's were mercenaries what shall we call the un	troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to	fight for the united nations	6458.636733855808
6394. if the un troops are not mercenaries	then the hessians were not mercenaries either	942.4479320085957
6395. and if the foreigners	fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette	and von steuben were mercenaries too as were also the members of the	lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 and of	chennault's flying tigers in the early days of world war 2	7343.238451068653
6396. it doesn't take a gore vidal to tell you	what's wrong with cherokee textile's slogan pitney-bowes	objects july 1	1738.7605451156044
6397. it's an eighteenth-century negative man!	suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment:  by moving	the term republic to lower case substituting the modern	phrase move ahead for the stodgy keep and by using the postmaster's	name on every envelope	the slogan cannot fail	6442.913903151362
6398. impending death of pope	in the issue of march 5 1960 you had an	excellent editorial which said:   on trial in jakarta for	having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents	us	pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting	the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence	of indonesia	5245.701819006026
6399. facing a prosecution which has demanded the	death penalty he said: 'i have participated in the war against	communism in korea and at dienbienphu and i have helped in the evacuation	of north vietnamese to the free world	6055.954784312005
6400. i have done all this	for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states	which have been threatened by communist domination'	2457.077193599672
6401. at least in	indonesia khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with	communism!   since then nothing has happened to save the	life of pope	4267.635806699734
6402. i found recently a very small article in the new	york times:   us	flier loses plea	1259.9321577934584
6403. indonesia court	upholds pope's death sentence	64.75123903659384
6404. indonesia military supreme	court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence	pope an american pilot	1413.5269333336844
6405. pope was convicted last year of having aided	north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions	1641.4864023430887
6406. he has been in	prison since may 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas	1253.7993527620956
6407. he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency	249.692312426831
6408. as	we see pope may appeal to president sukarno khrushchev's friend	for clemency	783.2793768288209
6409. this possibility is anything but reassuring	65.37271570491744
6410. the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban	freedom fighters	786.120814827554
6411. but who will act now and immediately to save the	life of alan pope	1410.7606227754047
6412. are tractors available for him	14.842089021411175
6413. does anybody	think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot	959.7077302214378
6414. a few days before i saw your mention of what texas	liberals were doing to promote louis capet the week	june 3 another analogy had occurred to me	2977.41527320452
6415. consider	this table:  louis 14- fdr	65.16554923634843
6416. h with no strong	men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government	1261.4775111406607
6417. a 'dust-settling' period	of decadence and decline	140.61285641456396
6418. h he opened his mouth said little and thought not at all	636.6631598245948
6419. h not completely virtuous	but completely incompetent	141.25880687269606
6420. and marie antoinette- jacqueline	bouvier	14.895191855414804
6421. h the beautiful and light-hearted	22.310957786295525
6422. french revolution- conservative revolution	2.9602095304638394
6423. truly	that liberals should choose louis 14 as a bogey-symbol of conservatism	is grotesquely ironic considering the louis 14 character	of their grand monarque fdr: not only in his accretion of absolute	power and personal deification	but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies	7144.297668442639
6424. in defeating louis capet john tower's victory in	texas signals once again the end of the divine right of liberalism	1883.6208470061035
6425. it seems to me that nc in his editorial	confrontation sr mar 25 has hit upon the real	problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain	our personal relationship with those who suffer	6168.649856048991
6426. this affects us	all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress	1248.2651274855002
6427. i know of no other solution than the one nc proposes-	to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that	this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place	6085.6591594162965
6428. never	have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically	507.0707174936272
6429. thank you for the illustrated editorial confrontation	141.64142077773013
6430. it is both great writing and profound religion	168.086916436494
6431. nc	has said something important so well that this preacher	will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece	2799.72152127669
6432. i	feel that nc hit the very core of our existence in the editorial	confrontation	1102.3083589628657
6433. personally it meant a great deal; my	only hope is that it will be shared by many many others	2602.43496220471
6434. confrontation	should fortify us all whether in southeast	asia or the us	643.2565221202183
6435. congratulations to nc	for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the	peace corps	2123.1432000502714
6436. i concur that it is necessary for americans to have	a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands	1730.2077951775452
6437. it would	be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted	by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into	3498.4322727275685
6438. the editorial confrontation was certainly direct	in its appear to those of us living here in america	1409.5561227149456
6439. i personally	gained strength from it	65.30127114829942
6440. thanks for continuing to capture the attention	and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world	1569.0784066424044
6441. nc's editorial confrontation is a stunning piece	of writing	391.59484623699484
6442. i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone	entering the peace corps to read it	1250.2123640000677
6443. the important people to	humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros h but the schweitzers	and the dooleys and the others like them whose names we will	never know	4865.23402760882
6444. editor's note: reprints of confrontation	will be included among the material to be distributed to	members of the peace corps	1873.689398540814
6445. a peace corps official described the	editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the	men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers	4286.051522330814
6446. bostonian	0.20041515
6447. f l lucas's article in sr's	april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the	new english bible	3477.5863288416876
6448. i certainly hope this will be the impression left	in the minds of readers rather than the comment by cleveland amory	in his first of the month column	2974.8946277233727
6449. it is blind fundamentalist	dogmatism to say messing around with the king james version	h seems to us a perilous sport at best	3503.5997896809117
6450. lester markel is on the right track in his article interpretation	of interpretation	sr mar 11	1256.2437217327922
6451. the current stereotype	of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting	the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored	fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished	in this country more than a generation ago	6562.144937898622
6452. we don't	need this type of protection any more	259.9767430453925
6453. the public is now armed with	sophistication and numerous competing media	754.6863319401386
6454. besides there are no	longer enough corruptible journalists about	262.01949964667654
6455. the accepted method	of writing news has two major liabilities	562.3194318870471
6456. first it does not communicate	14.720664112651699
6457. a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements	of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell	his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute	5649.370211761925
6458. second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous	376.22024581280976
6459. the	charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed	innocent people but misled the nation	2355.3909508224633
6460. yet the press was powerless	to put these charges in perspective in its news columns	1094.0573804870373
6461. despite several	years of front-page stories the average citizen was unable to get	a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen	what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way	of communicating	6301.675463013897
6462. the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions	375.8825879423288
6463. it seems to me the time has come for the american	press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will	do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by	those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve	their own ends	7582.742276613967
6464. the objective should be to provide a method of getting	into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant	information in the possession of reporters and editors	3222.8811815038034
6465. i would like to see you devote	some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president	kennedy's activities so far as southern california is concerned	4509.776928396515
6466. you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised	press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent	opinions	2736.56609827177
6467. to begin with the all-powerful los angeles times	does not publish a transcript of these press conferences	2123.139294979304
6468. i	am sure that they did when eisenhower was president	369.476057075534
6469. next	because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks	during the middle of the day	2365.7230354792646
6470. up until now the networks have grudgingly	run half-hour tapes at 5 pm or sometimes 7 or 10:30 pm	1738.6155235271992
6471. even then a few of the less interesting questions are	edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator	2350.25835321303
6472. however last night	the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got	on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley	and brinkley could squeeze into their programs	3850.167909922082
6473. this is no criticism	of them as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute	news summary	2595.7644696818047
6474. the radio stations did run transcripts	during the evening hours	373.9383307076281
6475. however by comparing	the tv snatches two different radio station re-runs and the censored	los angeles times version i found that the radio stations	had edited out questions	or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president's answer	6322.926010832924
6476. i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country	about the abuse he is being subjected to	2191.3756014991664
6477. we out here don't	see enough of the conference to know he is being abused	1652.925922093349
6478. i don't	know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently	it is not	1570.8697726185574
6479. it also happened with the inauguration which was	not re-run at all during the evening hours and i wrote to the tv	editor of the times	4075.313946910718
6480. he did mention in his column the fact that	he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand	the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this-	but nothing happened	3750.9104771133157
6481. can you bring the networks' attention	to this	248.97014697196406
6482. i was interested	in james webb young's madison avenue column in which	he raised the question do we need a college of propaganda	2330.3445194662067
6483. sr feb 11	0.30041514999999996
6484. in my estimation we definitely	do; and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into	excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die	3227.2022821618325
6485. during	the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare	which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the	various shades of grey in between	4988.276825223401
6486. we had a couple of schools in this	country the principal one being on the marshall field estate out	in lloyd's neck	2184.895089915946
6487. there were also a couple in canada and several	in england	752.8220411516876
6488. the english schools preceded ours and by the time we	got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda	and its teaching	2741.8470220433337
6489. four of us here in the united states attended	first as students then as instructors almost every one of these	schools in england canada and the united states	4489.164136163721
6490. we set up	the lloyd's neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there	940.3980058557187
6491. toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something	about propaganda and how to teach it	3044.0516731030602
6492. when the end did	come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped	that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust	2974.868714309606
6493. we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some	sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year	or so	4101.913558185255
6494. alas no such thing happened	14.797431728429084
6495. there apparently is no school of	propaganda or psychological warfare	562.944057472477
6496. a study at the pentagon and at	the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there	1417.3612735492254
6497. and	not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been	called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way	4063.7290103993814
6498. congratulations	on the article do we need a college of propaganda	505.2701686056429
6499. this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this	critical field in years and i certainly hope it sparks some action	3497.5385233059656
6500. many of us in public	relations were flattered that richard l tobin chose to devote his	editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger	of the public relations society of america and the american public	relations association	4155.379704689121
6501. i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue	of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet	been published	4268.015519265769
6502. whether in his forthcoming book c p snow	commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily	autobiographical critic charged him is important	2733.1192240151095
6503. one should be able	to get hold of the book at once	961.4525863095502
6504. but the attack was made from an advance	copy	263.8280588204599
6505. if this practice should take root and spread the man who	submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before	he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality	5486.744238707244
6506. editor's note: sir robert watson-watt	wrote on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961: i	have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled 'science	and government'	3659.175239257516
6507. until the work actually appears i am	not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail	1640.4947354646836
6508. but i have compared	its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin	lectures at harvard from which the book was derived and i can	with confidence challenge the gist of c p snow's incautious	tale	4133.209161391075
6509. watson-watt's remarks in sr did not then	constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures	2817.735248665694
6510. representatives of harvard university press which is publishing	the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge	that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print	an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date	4308.478014460536
6511. the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the	prepublication excerpt	1413.227054860809
6512. sir robert watson-watt's rebuttal	of sir charles snow's godkin lectures is marred throughout	by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself	from sir charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods	in an unclear incoherent argument	4043.2046102845297
6513. the article	presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning	757.8662429610587
6514. it calls the	conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike	a perverted conclusion	1097.7357927239418
6515. it submits	an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing	another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir	charles' account	3688.9099632116595
6516. we are left to choose between the two lindemanns	262.44744420212834
6517. the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the	result of the tea party	2110.2493070706983
6518. but we are to believe that lindemann actively	supported radar outside the tizard committee and dissembling	discounted it inside	1715.8640699937507
6519. if so i would lean to sir charles' conception	of the man	961.7808632514309
6520. i think it was a grave error to print the	article at this time	942.1501646023237
6521. to the unfortunate people unable to attend the	godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the	book which may dissuade some people from reading it	4474.019075150709
6522. it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the	violin	783.1456127708805
6523. certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless	recitals and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with	the chicago symphony orchestra playing the brahms concerto with	his own slashing demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high pale	pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music	or forever finds it closed	8253.983172957207
6524. there was about that song something	incandescent for this brahms was milstein at white heat	1095.6055131591338
6525. not	the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious	or even the most eloquent	2376.7005399458562
6526. those would be reserved for the orchestra's	great nights when the soloist can surpass himself	1100.120101151217
6527. this time the	orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own	high mood	2127.4840843103007
6528. but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only	up to a point	1097.313222063974
6529. that is when mr milstein thrust straight	to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing	glittering and sometimes spitting mr hendl could go along	4496.431735824808
6530. but	mr hendl does not go straight to any point	374.20633878387935
6531. he flounders and	lets music sprawl	64.6355932138465
6532. there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and	marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra	and music to ultimate fusion	2747.423187322175
6533. so we had some dazzling and memorable	milstein but not great brahms	961.4992317612362
6534. the concert opened with	another big romantic score schumann's overture to manfred	which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic	point to keep it afloat	2972.6277489658105
6535. hindemith's joust with weber tunes was	a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent	textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit	3073.0091864185224
6536. it got the kind of scrambled	coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when	the man with the baton lacks technique and style	2598.8223538461216
6537. summer	the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production	of tannhaeuser staged by wieland wagner who is doing all the	operas this time and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch	4825.686928221125
6538. sawalisch	also conducts the flying dutch opening july 24	263.439477050369
6539. parsifal	follows july 25 with hans knappertsbusch conducting and he	also conducts die meistersinger to be presented aug 8 and	12	3047.047249626079
6540. the ring cycles are july 26 27 28 and 30 and aug	21 22 23 and 25	1428.0155177514514
6541. no casts are listed but	lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano grace bumbry will	sing venus in tannhaeuser	2822.5353808507957
6542. remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago	missed seeing the bolshoi ballet	936.1952957841311
6543. remember how by lack of two big	theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet	2356.5068055210604
6544. well now we have two big theaters	94.11005031654545
6545. but barring a miracle and	don't hold your breath for it chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov	ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and	is one of the great companies of the world	5934.444978727707
6546. before you let	loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times	indeed we did	1719.1257949102244
6547. the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big	theater in mccormick place which sol hurok ballet booker extraordinary	considers the finest house of its kind in the country- and	of course he doesn't weep at the capacity either	6438.829400678488
6548. allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates	as dec 4 thru 10	791.2705024922791
6549. later the hurok office made it dec 8 thru	17 a nice long booking for the full repertory	2355.1511325806905
6550. but if you keep a calendar	of events as we do you noticed a conflict	1101.9098746070515
6551. allied arts had	booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec 8 and 9	1189.9665687822592
6552. not la dietrich	0.20041515
6553. allied arts then notified	us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking fly here	to open nov 28 and close dec 2	3887.1174010712866
6554. shorter booking but still	a booking	43.35600073273473
6555. a couple of days later a balletomane	told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was	told the newspapers had made a mistake	4068.5823705147145
6556. so i started making	some calls of my own	261.78937541147803
6557. the kirov ballet	is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium los angeles nov	21 thru dec 4	2124.5152568100234
6558. not a chance of opening here nov 28-	barring that miracle	501.762170951113
6559. then why not the juicy booking hurok had held	for us	751.2193407671449
6560. well dietrich won't budge from mccormick place	94.63817124264939
6561. then	how about the civic opera house	141.38434376858442
6562. well allied arts has booked	lena horne there for a week starting dec 4	943.6461154125287
6563. queried about	the impasse allied arts said: better cancel the kirov for	the time being	1644.2257526455292
6564. it's all up in the air again	93.70780492486134
6565. so the kirov	will fly back to russia minus a chicago engagement a serious	loss for dance fans- and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of	one of the richest bookings in the country	5331.654995727955
6566. will somebody please	reopen the auditorium	43.64958357427833
6567. paintings and drawings by marie moore of st thomas virgin	islands are shown thru nov 5 at the meadows gallery 3211	ellis av week days 3 p m to 8 p m sundays 3 p m	to 6 p m closed mondays	6590.4755928027325
6568. an exhibition of	evelyn cibula's paintings will open with a reception nov 5 at	the evanston community center 828 davis st	2038.1291700130464
6569. it will continue all	month	22.187755031157586
6570. abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear	are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame	until nov 5	1733.9421857543762
6571. in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget the dallas	civic opera will use san francisco's new leni bauer-ecsy	production of lucia di lammermoor this season returning the favor	next season when san francisco uses the dallas don giovanni	designed by franco zeffirelli	6911.202518875881
6572. h e bates has scribbled a farce called hark hark	the lark! it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible	novels of the season	2605.483034040534
6573. if there is a moral lurking among the	shenanigans it is hard to find	1411.1608740598333
6574. perhaps the lesson we should take from	these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild	scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics	2723.4331695482633
6575. anyway a number of	them meet here in devastating collisions	560.5524587406983
6576. one is an imperial london	stockbroker called jerebohm	166.38412040547666
6577. another is a wily countryman called larkin	whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled i believe	in earlier volumes of mr bates' comedie humaine	3699.0034916056384
6578. what's	up now	0.20041515
6579. well jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the	stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive	rustic simplicities	3474.584828018634
6580. they want to own a junior-grade castle	or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might	once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded	courtiers	3466.9949759855203
6581. they are willing to settle however in anything	that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at	2575.0156437446935
6582. and of course	larkin has just the thing they want	374.690374270583
6583. the name of it is gore court and it is surrounded	by a wasteland that would impress t s eliot	2832.9018520067602
6584. that's not	precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it though	786.2954440650703
6585. he conjures	herds	of deer and wild birds crowding the air	747.7768419148218
6586. he suggests	that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor	640.8542567603051
6587. the stained-glass	windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling	may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform	3265.369811411446
6588. the vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions	when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch	2326.2369691892945
6589. larkin has an answer to all that	138.77811793626054
6590. the spaciousness of the tudor	cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra	television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids	2597.9075764510526
6591. also perhaps	table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented	1184.4682065095762
6592. it's a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble	larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse	1708.6014579804698
6593. he doesn't really need the immense sum of money	he makes them pay	1176.1577666334936
6594. for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot	260.618338276556
6595. he has	a glorious wife and many children	251.1667532405906
6596. when he needs money to buy something	like say the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he	takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies	2983.5157702924835
6597. one of those capital-gains	ventures in fact has saddled him with gore court	1184.6906092439754
6598. he is	willing to sell it just to get it off his hands	782.956122586068
6599. and the jerebohms	are more than willing to buy it	559.9387805545978
6600. they plan to become county people	who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth	1569.7521477606856
6601. one then the other	if in larkin's eyes they are nothing	but piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they	have to learn about the ways of truly rural living	5491.206863510177
6602. mr bates	shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc	637.6287971465047
6603. oneupmanship	is practiced by both sides in a total war	559.3914118560166
6604. first	the larkins are ahead then the jerebohms	167.31861889585068
6605. after larkin has been persuaded	to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what	he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers	4271.215516530773
6606. one	of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling's	tales of india does not approve of the way larkin gets	his birds	2727.676232018225
6607. he doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair	on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance	is entirely sporting	4471.872949219941
6608. but the brigadier dines on the birds with	relish	261.24938991783614
6609. it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive	film yet made from miguel de cervantes' don quixote	is the brilliant russian spectacle done in wide screen and color	which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street	playhouses	6703.494661406041
6610. more than a beautiful visualization of the	illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant	and his squire sancho panza in seventeenth-century spain this inevitably	abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an	affectingly warm and human exposition of character	4391.053434255257
6611. nikolai	cherkasov the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander	nevsky and ivan the terrible performs the lanky don quixote	and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility	and the surface absurdity of this poignant man	6710.329415339589
6612. his addle-brained	knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an	age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous	code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as cervantes no doubt	intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely	in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues	5217.836794264984
6613. cherkasov	does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do	1186.8295598978352
6614. he	treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection	and respect	644.0717021192814
6615. directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is	studiously	slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and	passing gravely through an impious world	4468.112418467215
6616. the complexities	of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately	stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in	place of the russian dialogue	2837.8898773473347
6617. the voices of all the characters including	that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform	with the personalities	2823.348304698541
6618. and the subtleties of the dialogue are most	helpfully conveyed	375.5347856615931
6619. since russian was being spoken instead of spanish	there is no violation of artistry or logic here	2117.5092820189616
6620. splendid	too is the performance of yuri tolubeyev one of russia's leading	comedians as sancho panza the fat grotesque squire	1886.2099763393248
6621. though	his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don	he gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant dignity-	too	3924.4353620561124
6622. it is really as though the russians have seen in this character	the	oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons	2038.8105264860271
6623. the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played	on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is	one of the best in the film	5197.875670526308
6624. true the pattern and flow of	the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in	the first half before don quixote goes to the duke's court	3095.7170377405805
6625. but	strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed	episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of	the old boy	3708.6807570777564
6626. there are other good representations of peasants	and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently	photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this	country in the program of joint cultural exchange	4119.428926334267
6627. also on the	bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called	sunday in greenwich village a tour of the haunts and joints	4100.0277898530185
6628. television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz	which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member	of the family	3121.3520460495047
6629. there seems to be an unfortunate assumption	that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example	could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary	4833.52538759342
6630. at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for chicago	and all that jazz presented on nbc-tv nov	26	1870.4472824022766
6631. the program came out of the nbc special projects department	and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series	3260.517503742157
6632. perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines	166.89680423990268
6633. if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different	department- one with enough confidence in the musical material	to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room	to display their talents	6679.1585688929845
6634. as a matter of fact this latter approach	has already been tried and with pleasing results	1251.873083143272
6635. a few years	ago a	timex all-star jazz show offered a broad range of styles	ranging from lionel hampton's big band to the free-wheeling	dukes of dixieland	4312.853069646433
6636. an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live	character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician	and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance	2995.1819217675206
6637. about that same time john crosby's tv series	on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space	is one of the most sensible things a producer can do	5012.54885620704
6638. in an hour remembered	for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries	went before the cameras for lengthy periods	2018.8122619140354
6639. the program had been arranged	to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration	on the music	2361.102701254442
6640. cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups	then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work	1563.939958698566
6641. chicago and all that jazz could not be faulted on the choice	of artists	1408.9697162846346
6642. some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden	gene krupa bud freeman pee wee russell johnny st cyr	joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley	2712.1163241981476
6643. the	jazz buff could hardly ask for more	250.87868727024048
6644. furthermore garry moore	makes an ideal master of ceremonies	262.1162730217531
6645. one of the script's big problems	was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances	by musicians of today	3479.5012026931895
6646. nbc had gathered a lot of historical material	which it was eager to share	937.0309792793505
6647. for example there was sheet music	with the word jazz in the title	to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold	3501.832455975633
6648. samples	soomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles	passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood	of the late teens and 1920's	2851.7664050360354
6649. however well chosen and cleverly	arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an	interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business which	should probably have been the gathering	of fresh samples of the chicago style	5916.777251970465
6650. another source of	nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this	view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would	have blotted out the entire glimpse	3753.7128410984164
6651. similarly in presenting still	photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a	close perusal	2363.1315514393414
6652. chicago and all that jazz may have wound	up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer	1574.748983735773
6653. by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase	for today's artists the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect	example of either	4668.637561199075
6654. still the network's willingness to experiment	in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily	anticipated	1714.9987302284667
6655. even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous	reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending	her debut as lucia in donizetti's lucia di lammermoor sunday	night	4657.518606811251
6656. the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of	cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland	took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic mad	scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the	other performers	4769.478695178028
6657. her entrance in scene 2 act 1 brought some	disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note	2381.0681856189076
6658. thereafter	the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved	judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship	some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization	2861.991711357053
6659. as she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness	emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost	unprecedented in years of performances of lucia	4468.2444034921255
6660. she topped	the sextet brilliantly	14.808681583686896
6661. each high note had the crowd in ecstasy	so that it stopped the show midway in the mad scene but the	real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding	at the moment	5483.008605813053
6662. miss sutherland appeared almost as another person	in this scene: a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura	who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her	role	3326.533422525636
6663. what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as	miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among	sopranos today	3270.095368831294
6664. this big flexible voice with uncommon range	has been superbly disciplined	499.88046160675776
6665. nervousness at the start must have caused	the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly	2579.5331027625402
6666. in	the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous	scene magnificently	1089.4850563759078
6667. technically it was fascinating aurally	spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic	565.8931262752151
6668. many years have passed	since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable	501.4614703916306
6669. her debut	over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine	751.0905052729897
6670. the	performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor	silvio varviso	942.3811840506767
6671. he injected more vitality into the score than	it has revealed in many years	1420.344297051463
6672. he may respect too much the italian tradition	of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them	in a singers' opera may be quite difficult	2973.6279181997133
6673. richard tucker	sang edgardo in glorious voice	140.55106428932226
6674. his bel canto style gave the performance	a special distinction	376.77016673478477
6675. the remainder of the cast fulfilled its	assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and	limited stage direction proved only serviceable	3735.1324128509355
6676. miss sutherland	first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959	374.8914689786437
6677. she	has since turned to bellini whose opera beatrice di tenda	in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her	to new york last season	4287.603773194349
6678. she will sing la sonambula with	it here next week	373.8258516208581
6679. anyone for musical ping-pong	4.455132719007013
6680. it's really quite fun-	as long as you like games	376.55713000170203
6681. you will need a stereo music system	with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and	one or more of the new london phase 4 records	4669.103291408733
6682. there are 12	of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the	star release	1721.4230843753762
6683. this features	the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various	national bands were marching by your reviewing stand	3030.8532228406707
6684. complete with	crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of	realism this disc displays london's new technique to the best effect	2453.8168623866186
6685. all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed	explanation of this new recording program	1896.6484507708622
6686. no reference is made to the	possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and	it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music	2967.2551209092035
6687. directionality	is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the sounds of	the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension	to the music	4665.070311999598
6688. you definitely hear some of the instruments close	up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently	more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely	being louder than the ones farther back	3889.9999914837003
6689. this is a characteristic of	good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural	sound	2128.0325424308426
6690. london explains that the very distinct directional	effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods	of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape	channels	3759.6260355742806
6691. these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active	co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two	channels which are impressed on the record	4688.976644923128
6692. in some of the numbers	the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and	then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects	2853.7915423500845
6693. some clue to the character of london's approach in these discs	may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include	the word percussion or percussive	4841.570275321397
6694. drums xylophones	castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably	well	505.6078861502792
6695. only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting	in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your	left and others facing them on the wall to your right	6085.4528391204085
6696. they are definitely	in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as	though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a	spirited volley	3462.882367123995
6697. stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and johnny	keating's kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive	moods	seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements just	didn't have so much character as the others	6215.076111249846
6698. there is an extraordinary	sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained	at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies	2601.015701466981
6699. the penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant	but brassy piano sounds in		1128.0399636788518
6700. all of the releases however are recorded at a	gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise	1717.4148585997584
6701. practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic	demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system	1887.1949915678247
6702. many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not	realistic	503.3359923181386
6703. strange but true- authenticity and realism often	aren't related at all	754.9572830304778
6704. almost every film bearing the imprimatur	of hollywood is physically authentic- in fact impeccably so	1094.9826352966468
6705. in	any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor	bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity	2119.435713478524
6706. the major studios	maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who	look to this matter	1414.032644132381
6707. during the making recently of an important biblical	film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only	of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports	arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and	complied with	6177.464800374238
6708. but alas the authenticity seems to stop at	the set's edge	502.45934058051216
6709. the drama itself- and this seems to be lavishly true	of biblical drama- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity	at all	3236.1985907816734
6710. the storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic	94.56352255727701
6711. thus in the story of ruth we have ruth naomi and boaz	and sets that are meticulously authentic	2360.7496528421057
6712. but except for a vague adherence	to the basic storyline- ie that ruth remained with naomi	and finally wound up with boaz- the film version has little to	do with the bible	3456.9038755584907
6713. and in the new king of kings the	plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to	the gospels	3264.2998560322726
6714. earlier this month edward r murrow director	of the united states information agency came to hollywood and	had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry	3098.8634425466744
6715. he talked about unauthentic storylines too	64.80366917288767
6716. he intimated that	they weren't doing the country much good in the cold war	935.6791180987293
6717. and	to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism	1181.8235823648924
6718. in many corners of the globe he said the major	source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet	2182.130126998635
6719. would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga	of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge	3063.5620826305267
6720. yet for	much of the globe hollywood is just that- prime if not sole source	of knowledge	1414.664786778769
6721. if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge	our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone what conclusions	do you think he might come to	4476.850401842288
6722. francois d'albert hungarian-born violinist who made his	new york debut three years ago played a return engagement last night	in judson hall	2186.6229541318853
6723. he is now president of the chicago conservatory	college	392.7551895471004
6724. his pianist was donald jenni a faculty member at depaul	university	501.5564233997669
6725. the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged	by the artists so that for the first half of the program when	the	piano was partially open mr jenni's playing was too loud	5329.351846647798
6726. in	vying with him mr d'albert also seemed to be overdriving his	tone	788.5590351973894
6727. this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the	performances however except in the case of the opening work mozart's	sonata in a which clattered along noisily in	an unrelieved fashion	5176.889153642011
6728. brahm's sonata in a although also	vigorous stood up well under the two artists' strong large-scale	treatment	1417.9575937320085
6729. mr d'albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews	an overly sweet vibrato	1196.9895032778218
6730. he made the most of the long brahmsian	phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work	a handsome performance	2468.969081891869
6731. a sonata for violin and piano called	bella bella by robert fleming was given its first united	states performance	2574.1414721098076
6732. the title refers to the nickname given his	wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board	of canada	2460.1314070419976
6733. the work's two movements one melodically sentimental	the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a ravel-like	style but they rehash a wornout idiom	3680.7136100470184
6734. they might well indicate conjugal	felicity but in musical terms that smack of hollywood	932.2662869836507
6735. works	by dohnanyi hubay mr d'albert himself and paganini	indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve	as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase	4858.076483116678
6736. standard items	by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program	264.9216079702729
6737. in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york	philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium but her program last night	at town hall was the greek-born pianist's first new york recital	since 1948	5495.1054382351485
6738. miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard	and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the	authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control	3348.3258947986337
6739. and the	tone she commands is always beautiful in sound	561.0943136408875
6740. since she also	has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the	romantic tradition miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure	2735.219280042781
6741. she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every	piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures	3477.8540412769325
6742. the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers	of this century	934.9952714064548
6743. it was in them that miss xydis was at her best	746.7240791474514
6744. the rachmaninoff prelude no 12 op 32 for instance gave	her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities- the	ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them	simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble	4116.511942943028
6745. the	four kabalevsky preludes were also assured rich in color and songful	954.0225361741639
6746. and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism	and modern bravura that prokofieff needs	1249.7172071873888
6747. miss	xydis'	earlier selections were mendelssohn's variations serieuses in which	each variation was nicely set off from the others; haydn's sonata	in e minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and chopin's	sonata in b flat minor	5892.129557404938
6748. a memory lapse in the last somewhat	marred the pianist's performance	502.3177431664293
6749. so what was the deepest music	on her program had the poorest showing	1188.5570151799946
6750. miss xydis was best when	she did not need to be too probing	786.8580180594247
6751. all the generals who held important commands in world war	2 did not write books	1628.6345903752283
6752. it only seems as if they did	93.62193309766138
6753. and the	best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written	1181.9762840139088
6754. one	of the very best is only now published in this country five years	after its first publication in england	1889.3635560516213
6755. it is defeat into victory	by field marshal viscount slim	566.6119052125399
6756. a long book heavily	weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither	so long nor so technical as it was originally	2322.162158852215
6757. field marshal slim	has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great	an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves are more	interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger	6068.406659292113
6758. the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of	course the field marshal himself	1417.4068392088934
6759. william joseph slim	first viscount slim former governor general of australia was the	principal british commander in the field during the burma war	3505.602958486539
6760. he	had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat	of 1942 when the ill-prepared ill-equipped british forces were outmaneuvered	outfought and outgeneraled	2597.5204569265366
6761. he returned in command of	an international army of gurkhas indians africans chinese and	british	1645.1610505491087
6762. and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles	and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most	brilliant campaigns of the war	3342.986661618863
6763. the forgotten war his soldiers	called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe	enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines	3459.0620483378107
6764. parts of defeat	into victory are a tangle of burmese place names and military	units but a little application makes everything clear enough	2326.6353295278864
6765. on	the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book	760.0162962070319
6766. field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes	505.11301595843645
6767. he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit	mistakes and even a cardinal error	2615.1966130033807
6768. he praises many individuals	generously	14.79667316931688
6769. he himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent	more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers	2110.5306212497703
6770. an army to win	defeat into victory is a dramatic	and lively military narrative	950.6785616879197
6771. but it is most interesting in its account	of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their	reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle	action	5142.282707596284
6772. before he could return to burma field marshal	slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite	them with fresh recruits	2607.6463331456343
6773. his remarks about training discipline	morale leadership and command are enlightening	758.8327444669173
6774. he believed in making	inspiring speeches and he made a great many	645.1071889445068
6775. he believed in being	seen near the front lines and he was there	1184.7549574083255
6776. for general morale reasons	and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was	short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly	3098.834458962595
6777. other crucial matters required constant supervision:	labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too;	administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with	top brass- british american and chinese; health hygiene medical	aid and preventive medicine; hospitals and nurses	; food and military supplies; logistics and transport;	airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be built	6667.701367695197
6778. of a commander	commenting on these and other matters field	marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:   when	in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the	bolder	3584.3627900221554
6779. the commander has failed in his duty if he	has not won victory- for that is his duty	2353.143915724368
6780. it only	does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which	others may have but which you cannot give them	2314.516647561906
6781. so	i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some	of it	2103.844676191782
6782. field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage	of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders	2037.9215843042307
6783. of the japanese private he says: he fought and marched till	he died	1187.8945646175614
6784. if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to	kill 495 before it was ours- and then the last five killed themselves	2597.9406074579633
6785. brooding about future wars the field marshal has this	to say: the asian fighting man is at least equally brave as	the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental	doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by	slaughter and mutilation around him	7227.455821208969
6786. he is by background and living	standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand	less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself	when thrown on his own resources	3656.15822624648
6787. a bunch of young buckaroos from out west who go by the name	of texas boys choir loped into town hall last night and succeeded	in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience	5356.550056009992
6788. actually the	program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded	and they sang it beautifully	1399.420894317447
6789. under the capable direction of the choir's	founder geroge bragg the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds	in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets	excerpts from pergolesi's stabat mater and all of the	britten ceremonial of carols	6472.197957374403
6790. their singing was well-balanced	clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing	503.1487111690852
6791. the	limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices-	an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional	waver and now and then a bleat	4315.809825517856
6792. but mr bragg is	a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with	his boys are generally superior	1891.4366876187355
6793. most surprising of all he has accomplished	some prodigies in training for the production of words	1886.722295332072
6794. the latin	for example was not only clear; it was even beautiful	638.7388926940001
6795. furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation	of the music	961.1024288416426
6796. lines came out neatly and in good balance	166.68199788641638
6797. the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish	248.47814343132762
6798. a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and	a few other passages enchantingly	1417.8167241503697
6799. other capable soloists included	david clifton joseph schockler and pat thompson	747.2328116460834
6800. the final	group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and	chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume	2024.4110973109357
6801. boys will be	boys and texans will be texans	395.74356011628964
6802. the combination proved quite irresistible	last night	94.23638853608769
6803. the polish song and dance company called mazowsze after	the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week	engagement at the city center last night	4474.006838560379
6804. a thoroughly ingratiating	company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly	realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all	evening	3218.5056328902797
6805. not that it is all funny by any means though some	of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome	high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious	as it is varied	6216.03257239439
6806. there is no use at all in trying to follow	it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format	and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses	for identification	4127.367146325068
6807. the material is all basically of folk origin	gleaned from every section of poland	1403.250286867745
6808. but under the direction of	mira ziminska-sygietynska who with her late husband founded the	organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated	selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators	and performed altogether professionally	3947.720706289883
6809. under the surface of the	wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training	and an equally professional sense of performing	3682.143425468506
6810. since	the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that	this is not the original company; it is more likely the sons and daughters	of that company	3104.3132158631634
6811. the girls are charming children and the men	are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters	1418.9128271826207
6812. the stage is constantly	full of them; indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on	stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers	2854.302587341792
6813. they can be exuberant	or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they	seem unable to be is dull	2826.8927821329335
6814. to pick out particular numbers is	something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously	excellent to be missed	2335.9832964865236
6815. there is for example a stunning krakowiak	that closes the first act; the mazurka choreographed by witold	zapala to music from moniuszko's opera strasny dwor'	may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see; there	is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and songs from the tatras	contain a magnificent dance for the men	8056.4609790591985
6816. everywhere there are	little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians	is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments	with winning warmth	3216.692545921157
6817. the matunuck presents king	of	hearts by jean kerr and eleanor brooke	958.9770259623174
6818. directed by michael	murray; settings by william david roberts	262.5596472143187
6819. the cast:	producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's	opener at matunuck in jean kerr's king of hearts	3256.570899944771
6820. the dialogue is sharp witty and candid- typical don't eat	the daisies material- which has stamped the author throughout her	books and plays and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience	liked it	3558.8300351558296
6821. the story is of a famous strip cartoonist an	arty individual whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts	a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material	4671.725125595653
6822. this is	when his troubles begin not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires	and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect	to the hero's sweetheart-secretary	3437.240737329458
6823. john heffernan playing	larry larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion	1190.7957653329509
6824. his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless	373.35868352860666
6825. this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint	of david hedison providence's contribution to hollywood who is	appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox	3674.0436971983754
6826. not that	mr hedison does not make the most of his role	637.8843674641981
6827. but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it	has to be that way	2117.2941971245846
6828. a word should be said for gary morgan a	broadway youngsters who as the adopted son makes life miserable for	nearly everybody and larkin in particular	2724.160573938381
6829. and for his playmate francis	coletta of west warwick who has a bit part billy	1641.8544826150132
6830. on the whole audiences will like this performance	168.45054027834254
6831. it is a tremendous	book lively constantly moving and the matunuck cast does well	by it	1887.5305866024592
6832. the presents epitaph for	george dillon	by john osborne and anthony creighton directed by wallace	gray	1250.3134281350108
6833. the cast:    the angriest young man in	newport last night was at the playhouse where epitaph for george	dillon opened as the jazz festival closed	3903.409345257959
6834. for the hero	of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered	by more than the lack of beer during a jam session	2859.759081653926
6835. he's mad	at a world he did not make	391.4162748095299
6836. furthermore he's something of	a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips	1106.7381654895548
6837. this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards	751.2209783476598
6838. they not only	think and feel cliches but live cliches as well	642.7409103513207
6839. it is into this	household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls	out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the	play	4450.799838863513
6840. an unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only	in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists	1887.5990023297672
6841. by the end of the	third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other	shells	3074.122344814333
6842. not altogether a successful play epitaph for	george dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in	a lesser work might be crippling	2319.30238884325
6843. it is awfully talky for instance	and not all of the talk is terribly impressive	1640.5250326263208
6844. but it strikes sparks	on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten	1102.4655575705426
6845. there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel groom	as dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage	after another	4495.365192554206
6846. this is an exciting young actor to watch	167.78205622025212
6847. just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart	whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch	3690.1064454668935
6848. miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an	icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment	1883.798273259747
6849. also fine are	sue lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female	spider and just as destructive harold cherry as her scratchy	spouse and hildy weissman as a vegetable in human form	5665.282590342705
6850. wallace	gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with	just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste	2724.9987811620294
6851. still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection	of that pale sustenance despair	2359.338032530356
6852. the presents where's	charley	2.9451034180041065
6853. with music and lyrics by frank loesser directed	by christopher hewett choreography by peter conlow musical direction	by samuel matlowsky	2820.3145065761173
6854. the cast:    everybody fell	in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater	and shelley berman was to blame	2180.0350663240856
6855. one of the finest soft shoe	tunes ever invented once in love with amy is also of course	one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come	out of american musical comedy in our era	6053.387067758703
6856. so the audience last	night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 got a rousing opening	chorus where's charley	2042.392204917533
6857. and berman sifted out all alone	on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering	into being	3282.344215043054
6858. it is greatly to berman's credit that he	made no attempt to outdo ray bolger	1101.4527337361671
6859. he dropped his earlier and delightful	hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse	called charley's aunt and let himself go with as an appealing	an amy as anybody could ask	5826.21777155284
6860. in brief berman played	himself and not bolger	166.51904027351014
6861. the big audience started applauding even	before he had finished	564.8304500381795
6862. the whole production this week is fresh	and lively	263.6868088752937
6863. the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous	gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days	2124.316047402291
6864. the ballet work	is on the nose especially in the opening number by the new ashmolean	marching society and students' conservatory band along	with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later	3341.1587804333176
6865. berman whose	fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist	proved himself very much at home in musical comedy	3903.657942712997
6866. sparrow-size	virginia gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful	smile made a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon as the real	aunt was positively	monumental in the very best gibson girl manner	3578.8448476431868
6867. all told where's charley	4.4146048094927774
6868. ought not to be missed	14.864932829806571
6869. it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only	a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right mr	berman	3896.2355320737215
6870. the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c	edwin knill's and martin tahse's production of	at veterans memorial auditorium	1874.182178857093
6871. the book is by jerome	weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyrics by sheldon	harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costumes and	lighting by william and jean eckart musical direction by jack elliott	and the production was directed by mr abbott	6707.940772787968
6872. the cast:	this is one of the happier events of the season	642.1753030002403
6873. the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night	and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians	are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the little	flower rides to break a lance again	6584.2487159392795
6874. i saw fiorello!	performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company	is every bit as good and perhaps better	2460.0060308082507
6875. certainly in the matter	of principals there is nothing lacking	561.1187797564776
6876. bob carroll may not bear	quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley	does but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello	as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and	remember that this wasn't really laguardia come back among us again	5213.91974561679
6877. then rudy bond was simply grand as ben the distraught	republican party district chieftain	1410.4912486348194
6878. and paul lipson as morris	the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley's dinner was	fine too	1726.854579111738
6879. as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity	and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest	little man	3467.239027740013
6880. charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie	who became the second mrs laguardia singing and acting with	remarkable conviction	1875.877659476792
6881. jen nelson as thea his first wife managed	to make that short role impressive	1398.9642718177752
6882. and little zeme north a dora	with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of	her love for floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then	is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings	4377.901978396733
6883. such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual	treatment of on the side of the angels and politics and poker	were handled splendidly and i thought rudy bond and his band	of tuneful ward-heelers made little tin box even better than	it was done by the new york cast; all the words of its clever	lyrics came through with perfect clarity	8396.66704365141
6884. the party at floyd's	penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic	through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic	statement of the era's nonsense	3216.1232922490317
6885. laguardia's multi-lingual	rallies when he is running for congress are well staged	and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical	theater	4081.497615161671
6886. martin tahse has established quite a reputation for	himself as a successful stager of touring productions	1253.9042576821366
6887. not a corner	has been visibly cut in this one	559.13297670463
6888. the sets are remarkably elaborate	for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place and they	are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness	3330.9332918483656
6889. being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience	with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their	eyes	4300.842044492712
6890. i'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this	it has all been done in superb style	and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts	who enjoys good musical theater	4028.496581560732
6891. presents	an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed	by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells	2605.640298483564
6892. the cast:	since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich brown	senior while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists i suppose	i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on where the	boys are but i shall do nothing of the sort	4706.816870453426
6893. instead-	and not just to prove my objectivity- i hasten to report that it's	a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of	reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort	lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with	the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group-	that is to say sex	8661.998111274417
6894. the answers the girls give struck	me as reasonably varied and healthily individual	794.5944919374717
6895. if most of them weren't	exactly specific- well that's the way it is in life i guess	2112.509033857613
6896. but at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't	profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems	instead	2466.2529498094636
6897. where the boys are also has a juvenile bounce	that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy	2129.381348808889
6898. there are some sharp	and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations- the best	of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where	a mermaid is performing	3362.976256909928
6899. most of the female faces are	new or at least not too familiar	1182.6329618337536
6900. dolores hart is charming in a leading	role and quite believable	503.65317161698357
6901. i was delighted with paula prentiss'	comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one's	highest hopes might ask	2819.4035402283
6902. a couple of the males made good comedy too-	jim hutton and frank gorshin	943.3951077886279
6903. the only performance which	was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux but since someone	had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things	do happen at these fracases i suppose this was the attitude the	part called for	6887.36620855822
6904. i must say however that i preferred the acting that	had something of a biting edge to it	1569.277296192016
6905. to anyone who remembers	newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the	boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz	festival ought to prove entertaining	5623.531365212284
6906. the second feature	is a british detective story that	will talk your head off	947.6753930150738
6907. the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james	was never more evident than in his letters	2128.750375953063
6908. here was a man with an	enormous gift for living as well as thinking	947.5789979259756
6909. to both persons and ideas	he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish	for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and	quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment	5340.620958018981
6910. for	this latest addition to the great letters series under the general	editorship of louis kronenberger miss hardwick has made a selection	which admirably displays the variety of james's genius not	to mention the felicities of his style	4040.0804190348563
6911. and how he could write!	his famous criticism of brother henry's third style is surely	as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter's intricate	air castles as henry himself could ever have produced	5640.034361412612
6912. his letter	to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant	forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up	penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing	good humor	4392.33994183056
6913. most of all his letters to his philosophic	colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help	to explain whitehead's reference to james as that adorable genius	4675.652169421718
6914. miss hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual	friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life	lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism	3330.8124138949015
6915. this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where	there seems to be an increasing lack of communication- or even desire	for communication- between differing schools of thought	5323.235232163357
6916. it holds	an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual	has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people	who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human	virtues	3943.129565188157
6917. to his harvard colleague josiah royce whose philosophic	position differed radically from his own james could write	different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other	social influence ever has and in converse with you i have always felt	that my life was being lived importantly	7345.0824081472865
6918. of another colleague	george santayana he could write: the great event in	my life recently has been the reading of santayana's book	2194.224915598168
6919. although	i absolutely reject the platonism of it i have literally squealed	with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position	is laid down on page after page	4662.255665170518
6920. writing to his colleague	george herbert palmer- glorious old palmer as he addresses	him- james says that if only the students at harvard could really	understand royce santayana palmer and himself and see that	their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life	and worth fighting for then harvard would have a genuine philosophic	universe	5373.7573831452255
6921. the best condition of it would be an open conflict	and rivalry of the diverse systems h	2124.365203248241
6922. the world might ring with the	struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other	1254.1227505388856
6923. the belaboring is of course jocular yet james was	not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless we measure him by	that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who	stakes all on his vision of god	5898.680893341437
6924. to james this vision never quite	came despite his appreciation of it in others	937.0145667322506
6925. but there is a	dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one	correspondent:	you ask what i am going to 'reply' to bradley	4651.657949950017
6926. but why need one reply to everything and everybody	262.61946223224334
6927. h i think	that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations	750.1603998424523
6928. all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statements	of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible	impersonally h	2744.210383592726
6929. as far as the rising generation goes why not simply	express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly	will displace the other	3678.8084204043457
6930. here again 'god will know his own'	94.53166197410054
6931. the collected works of james thurber now numbering 25 volumes	represent a high standard of literary	excellence as every schoolboy knows	3046.5160096497193
6932. the primitive-eclogue quality	of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall	is equally well known	1872.1925440749742
6933. about all that remains to be said is that the	present selection most of which appeared first in the new yorker	comprises a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little	more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the	book	6682.5429349067535
6934. the one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial	article entitled: how to get through the day	1725.3254146405939
6935. it is repeated	at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs	the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources	including palindromes paraphrases	and parodies	4480.717958841307
6936. the tyranny of trivia suggests	arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber	499.6749218537052
6937. and new vistas	of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled:	friends romans countrymen lend me your ear-muffs	such a phrase as drifts through dream and the new vocabularianism	4818.234393911293
6938. some of thurber's curative methods involve strong	potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended	for use only in extreme cases	2316.74667809345
6939. a burlesque paean	entitled: hark the herald tribune times and all the other	angels sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture	ballyhooey	3255.0851408624294
6940. how the kooks crumble features an amusingly	accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv	commercials and the watchers of the night is a veritable	waking nightmare	3108.1003733304683
6941. a semi-serious literary document entitled	the wings of henry james is noteworthy if only for a keenly	trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult	later period by modest owen wister author of the virginian	5647.167308281931
6942. james he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible	h namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces	upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions	3563.781260968004
6943. he	would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you	could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings	and complexities	4991.557009318599
6944. equally penetrating in its fashion is	the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation:	so much has already been written about everything that you can't	find out anything about it	3757.825784207524
6945. or the mildly epigrammatic utterance	: woman's place is in the wrong	395.9643432672302
6946. who	but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences	639.1624059937052
6947. a tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny	though it would be hard to explain why	1874.4287672503026
6948. one of them banged the sash	of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped	out of sleep and out of bed	2726.282971321197
6949. 'it's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly	and i sighed with relief	1179.273915507781
6950. 'thank god for that' i said;	'i thought it was a human being'	782.4588966396778
6951. in a sense	perhaps thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter	who first conceived the startling fancy of	a picture window in the abdomen	3909.970458662897
6952. that is it is literally a picture	window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture- trees	or flowers	2056.029515226131
6953. this is something like what thurber's best effects	are like if i am not mistaken	1655.5129183494766
6954. though no longer able to turn	out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches	thurber has retained unimpaired	his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness	2732.3734816414985
6955. in	his concluding paragraph he writes: the devoted writer of humor	will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can	3714.3222257331568
6956. for many	readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight	501.3696042548307
6957. the latest low is a puzzler	65.9180596707246
6958. the master's hand has lost none	of its craft	258.6694321255728
6959. he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions	of political and diplomatic life in the fifties	2824.473884557741
6960. the reader	meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse and	becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like	the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the	nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out	4616.139439600189
6961. but there	is a difference between the present volume and the early low	1187.8970517550974
6962. there	is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings	show	1267.8503646909066
6963. but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were	on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning	3280.2558847302485
6964. anyone	can draw his own conclusions from this difference	262.5110704217081
6965. it might be	argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish	the artist with drama in a lower key	3491.3535862627386
6966. but this argument cannot be	pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings	of its leaders in respect to corrosion	2448.5036394424715
6967. the communists wield	a power unknown to hitler	252.24426115373134
6968. and the leading issue that of piecemeal	aggression remains the same	499.5438882421521
6969. do we ourselves	offer mr low less of a crusade	560.2458434684736
6970. in the thirties we would	not face our enemy; that was a nightmarish situation and low was	in his element	1877.1487205027383
6971. now we have stood up to the communists; we are stronger	and more self-confident- and low cannot so easily put us to rights	3485.641970672379
6972. or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere	374.6888043330154
6973. it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they	do not outrage him now	2362.9274544297646
6974. he writes confucius held that in times	of stress one should take short views- only up to lunchtime	1559.7637106493248
6975. whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above	the level of the capably sardonic	2121.4601278773957
6976. dulles	0.20041515
6977. he does not seem to have	caught the subtleties of the man	961.0249030163347
6978. mccarthy	0.20041515
6979. the skies turn dark	but the clouds do not loose their wrath	961.4251739735066
6980. suez	0.20041515
6981. low seems to have	supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently	so there is no fire in his eye	3673.867160723924
6982. stalin's death	churchill's farewell to public life hillary and tensing on everest	quemoy and matsu- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade	2471.8475059636653
6983. instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles	249.4846939589971
6984. did low decide to let well enough alone when	he made his selections	787.0490220503148
6985. he often drew the bomb	22.356056586970272
6986. he showed puny	men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines	260.683455263544
6987. and khrushchev turned	out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all	1871.274553519807
6988. look in this book for weak mortals and only	on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale	1731.4072239409402
6989. read the moderately	brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once	in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas	4086.7884995571394
6990. a gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man city slicker	lebensraum specialist- tries to take over catfish bend in this	third relaxed allegory from mr burman's refreshing louisiana	animal community	3551.3508064403895
6991. the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he	arrives from new orleans accompanied by one wharf rat	2119.572687483368
6992. but like all	despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows	more threatening toward those who won't follow- such solid citizens	as doc raccoon; judge black the vegetarian black snake;	and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in	washington posing for fifty-cent pieces	5204.914719617913
6993. as soon as the fox	has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who	of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination	campaign	in the city	5486.955087420958
6994. about the very things	they train the mink	and other animals to fight	787.5636734005019
6995. and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that	he won't have anyone around that's against him and setting out	to break his second territorial treaty with the birds	4462.99646425871
6996. robert	hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal	fable that mr burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish	bend series	2859.1744341941794
6997. he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be	given fewer prizes	1402.2461069904166
6998. but it's hard to imagine mr burman as a nobel	laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous	fables	2187.3545924168557
6999. in substance they lie somewhere between the southern	dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris and	the polished witty fables of james thurber	3481.4461762112974
7000. george kennan's account of relations between russia and the	west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 is the	finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years	3771.42341262399
7001. it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: scrupulous	scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization	and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues	5352.031276728797
7002. in short the book based largely on lectures delivered at harvard	university is both reliable and readable; the author possesses	an uncommonly fine english style and he is dealing with subjects	of vast importance that are highly topical for our time	4309.690534709235
7003. if mr	kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis	of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars	and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic- well the	record itself is not too encouraging	6692.210878200691
7004. mr kennan takes careful	account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical	atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken	1877.490621987238
7005. but he rejects	perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-communist	influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin	which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high	point at the yalta conference in february 1945	6901.386749563598
7006. after all	alger hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he	gave secret state department documents to soviet agents was at yalta	2304.4193226664784
7007. and harry dexter white implicated in fbi reports	in communist associations was one of the architects of the morgenthau	plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have	simply handed germany to stalin	5769.228026920182
7008. one item in this unhappy scheme was	to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors	among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength	2736.542928480057
7009. it is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and	childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had	more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than	treason or sympathy with communism	5801.875162842267
7010. recognizing that there could have been no effective	negotiated peace with hitler he points out the shocking failure to	give support to the anti-nazi underground which very nearly eliminated	hitler in 1944	5187.229326826333
7011. a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge	of russian language history and literature kennan recalls how at	the time of hitler's attack on the soviet union in 1941 he penned	a private note to a state department official expressing the hope	that never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in	the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries	5517.44355764793
7012. with justified bitterness the author speaks of what	seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the	nature of the russian communist movement about the history of its	diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had	been going on in poland and the baltic states	7690.172424255834
7013. he also speaks of	franklin d roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only	he could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone	like fdr himself ideological preconceptions would melt and	russia's co-operation with the west could be easily arranged	4149.698884248641
7014. no wonder khrushchev's first message to president kennedy	was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of roosevelt	3265.5323391827737
7015. this fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in	personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 and	the two instalments of the russian revolution	3000.214866841768
7016. the first of these	involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government	in march 1917; the second the seizure of power by the bolsheviks	in november of the	same year	5347.636086502248
7017. as kennan shows the judgment of the allied governments	about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession	of defeating germany	2313.5443589941406
7018. they were blind to the evidence that nothing	could keep the russian people fighting	1411.4398201491572
7019. they attributed everything	that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue	790.3312589028803
7020. this	more than any other factor led to the fiasco of allied intervention	1173.4405039658195
7021. as the author very justly says:   had a world war not been	in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the	imagination have been an allied intervention in north russia	3442.2713363032517
7022. the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated	by communist propaganda; here kennan operating with precise	facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking	4460.261936130476
7023. dictators	of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's	vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators	whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may	be selected	3558.926754141783
7024. two criticisms	of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment	of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges- there is	no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan	5333.218253977639
7025. and	in a concluding chapter about america's stance in the contemporary	world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come	to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: how to deal with	a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war	4695.718266907858
7026. but one should not ask for everything	139.80197048775182
7027. mr kennan who has recently	abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently	appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia is not the only man who	finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future	4219.081820777807
7028. the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations	is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical	narrator	4104.042626683356
7029. the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter	political	or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit	and charm	2877.8026642485024
7030. in donnybrook there is quite a different eire a	rural land where singing dancing fist-fighting and romancing are the	thing	2848.7006789142806
7031. there is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence	and no one gets killed	1729.3335336166233
7032. by and large robert mcenroe's adaptation	of maurice walsh's film the quiet man provides	the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if	not a superlative one	5165.309289543585
7033. this is the tale of one john enright	an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring	and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become	a quiet man	4131.258475707534
7034. but innesfree where ellen roe danaher and her	bullying brother will live is no place for a man who will not use	his fists	3684.8163771968707
7035. so enright's courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded	considerably thereby providing the tale which is told	1423.6661811524305
7036. you may be	sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with	the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way	to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means	6437.21090896418
7037. then there is a matchmaker one mikeen flynn a role for which eddie	foy was happily selected	1419.5265624896276
7038. now there is no reason in the world why	a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe	dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck	except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play	6933.389284915237
7039. mr foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it	until he is practically perfect	1418.763344967039
7040. his matchmaking is naturally incidental	and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes	him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony	4118.00804697865
7041. art lund a fine	big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates	enright	1736.0293420951027
7042. although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic	technique that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have	anyway	3254.8083602350266
7043. joan fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she	has a temper whether she really has one or not plays ellen and sings	the role very well too	3245.1174217369303
7044. if the mettle which ellen exhibits has	a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind; she fits into the general	scheme well enough	3694.143094597975
7045. susan johnson as the widow spends the	first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented	death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new	one	3762.824172486463
7046. she has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues	of the evening	2114.3588476700556
7047. then there are a pair of old biddies played	by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf	of stock irish characters but they put such a combination of good	will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining	4520.552863053885
7048. and in the role of will danaher philip bosco roars and sneers	sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british	army if he chose	4307.1277792259625
7049. donnybrook is no brigadoon	but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some	excellent dancing	1580.9547095171456
7050. the ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally	competent	755.9017907270289
7051. it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after	the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy sez i	does	2336.977433746935
7052. a toast to the bride sung by clarence nordstrom playing	a character called old man toomey is quite simple direct and	touching	3285.7960066683722
7053. the men of innesfree are got up authentically in	cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine	1890.5659121471078
7054. so is	that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep	under jack cole's expert choreographic direction	3030.3495448345298
7055. the male dancers	sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and	stimulating	1096.9371647174544
7056. rouben ter-arutunian in his stage settings	often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr cole has placed couples	or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow	5330.3624753646
7057. there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty	good time at donnybrook unless they are permanently in the	mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable	irish	3936.841169304184
7058. we can all breathe more easily this morning- more easily	and joyously too- because joshua logan has turned the stage show	fanny into a delightful and heart-warming film	4521.168822667254
7059. the	task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol's original trio	of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting	them again on the screen after their passage through the broadway	musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed	4560.568454733331
7060. more than	the fans of pagnol's old films and of their heroic star the great	raimu were looking askance at the project	3264.748282757158
7061. the fans of the musical	were too	93.25755208426229
7062. but now the task is completed and the uncertainty	resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music	hall yesterday	3285.017005667786
7063. whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show whether	partial to music or no you can't help but derive joy from this	picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart	3686.9492111880086
7064. some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in	the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow	2824.9149145111232
7065. a tiny handful never did make the concert	167.05010343149056
7066. but after a fifteen-minute	delay the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage	for the afternoon's proceedings	1893.437071929299
7067. they faced a rather small audience	as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures	of the afternoon	2037.1756751087837
7068. it was an excellent concert	22.38511961736595
7069. paul	paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid	musician and the philharmonic plays for him	1892.9610065621732
7070. their collaboration in	the beethoven second symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding	1178.7878566190916
7071. it was not a heavy ponderous beethoven	94.2138866705482
7072. the music sang nicely	sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced	1190.2064891363352
7073. the franck symphonic poem psyche is a	lush	sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again	1419.6873571459323
7074. fortunate	for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor; if	it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying	3465.2566884431203
7075. mr paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic	elements of the score	789.9151314597937
7076. he did not let the strings for instance	weep whine or get hysterical	1180.9066782773596
7077. his interpretation was a model of refinement	and accuracy	261.2872148164911
7078. and in the prokofieff c major piano	concerto with zadel skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner	2367.038720411744
7079. mr skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping	and tonally percussive	641.5978799024199
7080. he swept through the music with ease in a	non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner	1183.7753605095972
7081. an impressive technician	mr skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot	374.76737648849183
7082. his tone is the	weakest part of his equipment; it tends to be hard and colorless	1866.4839895637451
7083. a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this	concerto needs	1089.1374289798182
7084. it is after all a non-romantic work	; and the composer himself	was called the age of steel pianist	1472.5005635947277
7085. but granted all this one	still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than	mr skolovsky supplied	2039.9022986365894
7086. taken as a whole though it was	a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra	1659.3580272087609
7087. mr skolovsky	fully deserved the warm reception he received	261.4127280522804
7088. a new work on	the program was nikolai lopatnikoff's festival overture	receiving its first new york hearing	2123.877371236302
7089. this was composed last year as	a salute to the automobile industry	643.5413766327166
7090. it is not program music though	65.49399572138412
7091. it runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical	and featureless	946.4860275364678
7092. la gioconda like it or not is a singer's opera	563.0629517169267
7093. and	so of course it is a fan's opera as well	503.77176217061435
7094. snow or no the fans	were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance	of the ponchielli work	3276.8361179968533
7095. so the plot creaks the sets	are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy	and not very well connected with what the singers were doing	2864.513192355234
7096. after	all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed	with no less than six leading parts	3249.780891046007
7097. one of those parts	is that of evil evil barnaba the spy	640.4843174374237
7098. his wicked deeds were carried	on by anselmo colzani who was taking the part for the first time	with the company	3030.579803870806
7099. he has the temperament and the stage presence	for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone	1889.6177019571467
7100. what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing	that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after	all a very oily character	5011.104452929323
7101. regina resnik as laura and cesare	siepi as alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect	to this season; they have both sung these parts here before	3223.756642498091
7102. laura	is a good role for miss resnik and she gave it force dramatic color	and passion	2122.960537101766
7103. mr siepi was as always a consummate actor;	with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently	1422.5190548276385
7104. part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the	vocal chords	956.2696508605252
7105. his singing was strong and musical; unfortunately his	voice was out of focus and often spread in quality	1558.147073719281
7106. eileen farrell	in the title role mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker	as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and	all contributed to a vigorous performance	4855.56391952827
7107. if only they and fausto	cleva in the pit had got together a bit more	1105.404575938273
7108. melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no	better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could	be imagined	3054.6038978487527
7109. their vanguard album	is a good sample of the special	elegant art of english madrigal singing	1259.6800738308623
7110. it also makes a fine introduction	to the international art form with good examples of italian	and english madrigals plus several french chansons	3490.3110266684853
7111. the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better	than anyone else	945.3906223347637
7112. the original impulses came to england late	and continue strong long after everyone else had	gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like	4299.027911340531
7113. even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian	interregnum the practice of singing together- choruses catches	and glees- always flourished	2031.6688511188393
7114. the english never again developed	a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier	great age the way say the opera in italy blotted out the italian	madrigal	5022.061759480306
7115. latter-day interest in elizabethan singing	dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead	of similar revivals in other countries	2179.6219852541612
7116. as a result no comparable	literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more	often performed than the english madrigal	3479.403528241416
7117. naturally mr	deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant	when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their	countrymen: william byrd thomas morley and thomas tomkins	3772.3032463290424
7118. there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency	to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture	3662.007217647194
7119. both techniques give the music purity and clarity	167.300555411537
7120. claude	jannequin's vocal description of a battle	is	lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other	chansons by jannequin and lassus	4486.188664281816
7121. only with the more sensual intense	and baroque expressions of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo	does the singing seem a little superficial	2041.2844182855483
7122. nevertheless the	musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently	reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period	2828.0182579364778
7123. the	works are presented chronologically	14.784565610438865
7124. texts and translations are provided	22.34787137159533
7125. the elements of elegance and color in jannequin	are strong french characteristics	641.0070483991697
7126. baroque instrumental music	in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled	and quite abstract	2118.338533493691
7127. in france it remained always more picturesque	more dancelike more full of flavor	790.0396513950603
7128. couperin and rameau	gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense	of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close	clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance	6030.673773074407
7129. both composers turn up on new imports from france	261.27046459428743
7130. bam	is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is	editions de la boite a musique	2836.958156157453
7131. they specialize in out-of-the-way	items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention	1421.349482348025
7132. of couperin le grand occupy	two disks and reveal the impeccable taste	and workmanship of this master- delicate flexible and gemlike	3056.1108355117926
7133. the concerts- nos 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented-	are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian	sense	2475.2156837841717
7134. the sonatas la francaise la sultane l'astree	and l'imperiale are often more elaborately worked	out and in fact show a strong italian influence	3460.270612356223
7135. couperin	also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk	called		435.8290615060654
7136. jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit but bodin de	beismortier corrette and mondonville are hardly household words	2364.9143013531184
7137. what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal	the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo	2461.0758217218195
7138. the couperin la steinkerque with its battle music brevity	wit and refined simplicity already shakes off corelli and points	towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era	4467.048395058928
7139. if	couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more	796.6625389238806
7140. all these records have close attractive sound and the performances	by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic	2138.5854414637106
7141. rameau's	recorded by l'orchestre de	chambre pierre menet turn out to be harpsichord	pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself	2182.980547398389
7142. the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes	inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious	2349.9083140562393
7143. maitres	allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music	by pachelbel buxtehude rosenmueller and telemann well performed	by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket		1564.6210383119326
7144. rococo music- a lot of it- was played in carnegie recital	hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored	this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts	5471.603116507625
7145. works by j c bach anton craft joseph haydn giuseppe	sammartini comenico dragonetti and j g janitsch were	performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff flutist	josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist	3756.7853541487757
7146. since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all	it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown	accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven	to boulez	5459.21386242739
7147. thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century	charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday	night	1893.1580422015656
7148. each might find a useful place in a varied musical program	but taken together they grew quite tiresome	2351.552690187046
7149. the performances	were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying	some by soloists proving rather trying	1570.670529566096
7150. ellie mao soprano and frederick fuller baritone presented	a program of folksongs entitled east meets west in carnegie	recital hall last night	3268.1990253265676
7151. they were accompanied by anna mi lee	pianist	167.58694636750454
7152. selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos	and duets in a broad range of languages	1873.51879991961
7153. songs from china and japan	were reserved exclusively for miss mao who is a native of china	and those of the british isles were sung by mr fuller who is	english by birth	3536.46845536549
7154. this was not a program intended to illustrate	authentic folk styles	753.6940062311701
7155. on the contrary miss mao and mr fuller	chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such	as mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten	2744.1860424773377
7156. thre	was	therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been	the case otherwise	1878.6338518055031
7157. the performances were assured communicative and	pleasingly informal	167.15666218669833
7158. what was omitted from a neglected education were	those essentials known as the facts of life	1893.9509207270535
7159. chabrier's	little one-act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at town hall	is a fragile precious little piece very french not without wit	and charm	2320.5797196270805
7160. the poor uneducated newlywed a certain gontran de boismassif	has his problems in getting the necessary information	2127.4333734766888
7161. the humor	of the situation can be imagined	166.9579225230965
7162. it all takes place in the	eighteenth century	252.89578249493866
7163. what a silly artificial way of life chabrier	and his librettists chuckle	643.2076944234661
7164. but they wish they could bring it back	249.9642616686449
7165. chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where	the classical rationalist tradition	becomes virtually neo-classicism	1260.307135799697
7166. the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste	and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or	mawkish	3708.529119322751
7167. the simple clever production was also able to tread	the thin line between those extremes	1095.9209585587744
7168. arlene saunders was charming as	poor gontran	140.88700631782348
7169. yes arlene is her name; the work uses the old eighteenth-century	tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced	youth to a soprano	2480.8460805010955
7170. benita valente was delightful as the young wife	and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring	3497.6821596837517
7171. the work was presented as the final event in the town	hall festival of music	1098.711144137223
7172. it was paired with a darius milhaud opera	the poor sailor set to a libretto by jean cocteau a	kind of grand guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and	gets done in by his wife	5901.556862730992
7173. with the exception of a few spots	milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties	odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration	2449.2523396429715
7174. had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon	249.56590018717597
7175. sat there	and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right	before my eyes and the eyes of some 5500 other people	2603.58119594249
7176. i make	this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she brought	up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female	reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote	in the paper the next day:   judy garland has arrived	in london	7239.689787871827
7177. she's not plump	0.20041515
7178. but who cares when the lady sings	140.12699794340037
7179. certainly not the largest	afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the	most attentive and quiet	1890.5790125961514
7180. they applauded every number not only at its	conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes	at the first chord	3469.6495724558795
7181. and judy sang the lovely old familiar things	which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions	of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings	3000.946407699099
7182. things like when you're smiling almost like being in	love do it again born to wander alone together	who cares	2812.802583865174
7183. puttin' on the ritz how	long has this been going on	499.1185563000784
7184. and her own personal songs	like the man that got away and the inevitable over the	rainbow	2133.040049828478
7185. miss garland is not only one of the great singers	of our time but she is one of the superb showmen	2035.5495060772566
7186. at the start of	her program there were evidences of pique	745.4167846903039
7187. she had held to the letter	of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4	pm the appointed hour although the music at newport people had	tried to get the program underway at 3	4046.868066479687
7188. then there was a bad delay	in getting mort lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs	1887.9729588855503
7189. along about 4:30 just when it was getting to be about time	to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side judy	came on singing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket	that flapped in the wind	4534.322519607604
7190. her bouffant coiffure was fortunately	combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk	breeze was blowing	3267.4161664014637
7191. in her first song she waved away one	encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter	the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm lenses	and shoot at extreme range	3770.5745825453077
7192. there also came a brief contretemps	with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during	a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and	she made the tart observation that i never saw so much moving about	in an audience	6906.779518853336
7193. but it didn't take judy garland showman	long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at	newport and that you have to learn to live with it	3423.5672817875006
7194. before her chore	was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling	microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining	in the informal atmosphere	4662.878306646855
7195. and time after time she really	belted out her songs	370.34007051762273
7196. sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged-	which was the way i felt about her come rain or come	shine- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her	shatteringly beautiful beautiful weather	5296.660566538485
7197. to her partisan	audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than	a critic striving to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their	haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough	4065.32134914564
7198. they were rewarded with splendid exciting singing	141.36116023212068
7199. her rockabye	your baby was as good as it can be done and her really	personal songs like the man that got away were deeply moving	2726.947629583304
7200. the audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard	over the rainbow- although the fellow that kept crying for	get happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway	5000.545025384903
7201. she	was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with	its cheers and applause and flowers	1733.2499467319
7202. all went home happy except	the newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6:35	might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of	their happy hour at the cocktail bar	5658.692384244057
7203. in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning	in the northern skies	941.4188254966069
7204. this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the	evening- flashes in the distance but no storm	2121.8356038663906
7205. several times	it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder	from jerry mulligan's big band which is about as fine an aggregation	as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond	found count basie working in a kansas city trap	4841.159688881265
7206. mulligan's	band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it	does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the	big concert aggregations	4829.52785000091
7207. but what is equally impressive is	the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan's	baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer's arrangement	of django's castle	3327.658443346975
7208. for subtle swinging rhythms	i could admire intensely mulligan's version of weep and	the fireworks went on display in 18 carrots for robert a sax	tribute to johnny hodges	4664.624574187727
7209. there was considerable contrast	between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the	jazz messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such	a small group	3212.493981531951
7210. unfortunately blakey doesn't choose to work much	of the time in this vein	1175.6385334289278
7211. he prefers to have his soloist performing	and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like	2035.3533638256745
7212. what we did get however was impressive	138.73420772897742
7213. a few drops	of rain just before midnight when sarah vaughan was in the midst of	her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly	but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listeners	didn't care whether they got wet	4818.614233243803
7214. miss vaughan was back	in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time-	like a fine wine	2834.1437227400347
7215. after the spate of female vocalists we have been	having all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried	to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed	that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than	ever	5117.331673579257
7216. the evening program was opened	by the jazz three a newport group consisting of steve budieshein	on bass jack warner drums and don cook piano	3882.645264476329
7217. this was a	continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night	when the eddie stack group also local talent went on first	2726.5084717970535
7218. the jazz three	displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set	but as the emergency accompanists for al minns + leon james the	superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three	successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution	of the blues to a spot on the evening program	4571.62882132306
7219. sings	julie wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists	sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old	oldies as hard-hearted hannah the vamp of savannah and	the delightful sunday	5746.8795882110635
7220. she frosted the cake with the always reliable	bill bailey	376.2132627144699
7221. from this taste of the 1920s we	leaped way out to stan getz's private brand of progressive jazz	which did lovely subtle things for baubles bangles and beads	and a couple of ballards	5302.7883968316655
7222. getz is a difficult musician to categorize	93.53604740141934
7223. he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than	for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has	a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising	is over	5645.600982135463
7224. in this he is sticking with tradition however far removed	from it he may seem to be	1407.3005275153423
7225. george shearing	took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of	vibes guitar bass drums shearing's piano and a bongo drummer	3461.5795209730845
7226. he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung	from jazz to latin american things like the mambo	1734.3243394960107
7227. shearing himself	seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport	appearances	1863.0210753418348
7228. a very casual pleasant program- one of those	easy-going things that make newport's afternoon programs such a	relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh	breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came	to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach	5184.217481283421
7229. divided	almost equally into two parts it consisted of the evolution of	the blues narrated by jon hendricks who had presented it last	year at the monterey calif jazz festival and an hour-long session	of maynard ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band	6802.044340492413
7230. hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small	audience of small children right on stage with him	1892.09186277847
7231. tracing the blues	from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country	and the west indies he stressed the close relationship between	the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches	5935.594592998296
7232. addition	to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz	he had big miller as a preacher-singer and hannah dean gospel-singer	while oscar brown jr an extremely talented young	man did a slave auctioneer's call a field-hands' work song and	a beautifully sung negro lullaby brown baby which was one of	the truly moving moments of the festival	5497.217771410954
7233. one of those delightful	surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs	was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones drumming	to old man river which seems to have been elected the favorite	solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts	7320.44962803451
7234. demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues	was michael babatunde olatunji who plays such native drums as	the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest	3357.9938041062305
7235. he	has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of	last year's afternoon concerts	2351.4989148476147
7236. hendricks had billy mitchell	tenor	sax; pony poindexter alto sax; jimmy witherspoon	blues singer and the ike isaacs trio which has done	such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical	examples	3776.7643825830355
7237. it all went very well	22.27176167056871
7238. pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know	the interesting material contained in schubert's sonatas	1579.3154138517502
7239. music	lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent	example played for rca by emil gilels	2807.7019877370512
7240. he has chosen sonata	op 53 in d	166.05842457309512
7241. the playing takes both sides of the disc	250.90502134214094
7242. perhaps	one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often	is their great length	1266.948173847131
7243. rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness	of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention	with the gilels playing	3041.7126009455187
7244. his technique is ample and his musical ideas	are projected beautifully	504.76870854703986
7245. the male chorus of the robert	shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style	1396.8367795803395
7246. the group is superbly	trained	14.862124650574575
7247. what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type	of song is in question	1882.0025635010456
7248. do you say chantey as if the word were derived	from the french word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think	of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the french-canadian	use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as	a boat-yard	4983.422679261059
7249. i say chantey	0.30041514999999996
7250. either way the robert shaw chorus	sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame	spelled out in terms of agreeable listening	2700.0905093039573
7251. if your favorite song	is not here it must be an unfamiliar one	1188.5630046114366
7252. the london label offers	an operatic recital by ettore bastianini a baritone whose fame	is international	1262.815420960719
7253. murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry	street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons	in the premiere of his latest work signal and the repetition	of an earlier one journal	5790.66304484743
7254. signal is choreographed	for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais	938.7165219141056
7255. its abstract decor is by john hultberg	141.11075920608465
7256. program note reads	as follows:   take hands h this urgent visage beckons us	791.8255130500289
7257. here as in journal mr louis has given himself	the lion's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is	capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting	physical movements	5925.582942609575
7258. indeed both journal and signal	qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics	643.8347136645133
7259. but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and	it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing	3047.0884952426027
7260. one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations	could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is	too little suggestion of organic relationship and development	3200.8283123390124
7261. it may be of course that mr louis is consciously trying to create	works that anticipate an age of total automation	3037.3587798998224
7262. but it may be	also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics	at the present time	1875.790728517628
7263. one thing is certain however and that is that	he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours	of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be	5482.2637781983485
7264. a brisk satirical spoof of contemporary	american mores entitled an american journey was given its	first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night	by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company	3447.5138119620956
7265. choreographed	by mr nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that	also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris' once	upon a time h as well as her women's song and	mr nagrin's indeterminate figure	6344.784863219496
7266. eugene lester	assembled a witty and explicit score for an american journey	and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes	1880.9415475738886
7267. mr nagrin has described four places each with its scenery	and people added two diversions and concluded with a	toccata for the young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation	of rock'n'roll dancing	4852.107621174184
7268. the places could be anywhere	the idiosyncrasies	and foibles observed there could be anybody's and	the laugh is on us all	2037.646166530568
7269. but we need not mind too much because mr	nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever	almost all the way	3691.9333448486714
7270. miss tamiris' once upon a time	h is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures	that bother them somehow	2609.297759711082
7271. unfortunately the man and	woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the	menacing figures failed to make them any more so	4084.9904481757994
7272. nor did the dancing	involved really seize the attention at any time	638.4315273719651
7273. the music here russell	smith's tetrameron sounded good	251.82767303485548
7274. all the performances	of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company	with mr nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers seemed	to be fine shape	3099.5370205738627
7275. the symphony of the air greatly assisted by van cliburn	last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall	off to a good start	3895.0652168697825
7276. at the same time the orchestra announced that	next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie and	that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each	of them in five different communities	3945.587809992252
7277. this news announced	by jerome toobin the orchestra's administrative director brought	applause from the 2800 persons who filled the hall	2832.4884792135845
7278. they showed they	were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there	so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln	center of the new york philharmonic the philadelphia orchestra	and the boston symphony	4306.122673784468
7279. this season the orchestra has already	taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription	concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county	center in white plains	5340.276398346765
7280. the details of the suburban concerts	next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced	later mr toobin said	2461.0606454547096
7281. the concertos that van	cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return	from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky the rachmaninoff	third and the prokofieff third	5012.864450708173
7282. it was pleasant last night therefore	to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded	the emperor	1897.7889977859893
7283. the young texas pianist can make	great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities	of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him	4643.658665107882
7284. but they	were not what distinguished his performance	166.5283126369927
7285. the elements that did	were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the	third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger	moments of the opening movement and the final rondo	5632.425770599293
7286. mr	cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne	942.6804729095469
7287. alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that	he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of	broodinf poetic mystery	3899.5420445590526
7288. the collaboration was remarkable as it was	in both the other movements too	790.6327303927666
7289. mr wallenstein who	will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the leonore	overture no 3 and the fourth symphony	3502.27650017053
7290. the orchestra	was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively	640.5796993219062
7291. and although	there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at	its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed	tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven	5899.721511411144
7292. igor oistrakh	will be the next soloist on feb 4	373.84257909959064
7293. there are times when one suspects that the songs that are	dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be	better than many of those that are left in	4985.81997703156
7294. today in the era of the	integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all	development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter	how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does	not perform the function required of it	4995.967419087631
7295. in the more casually	constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties	there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song	of merit	4281.250636494521
7296. yet there is the classic case of the gershwins' the	man i love	791.9973251692437
7297. deemed too static when it was first heard in lady	be good in philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score	3239.55961891226
7298. it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version	of strike up the band and again abandoned shortly before the	entire show was given up	2985.771720474155
7299. it finally reached broadway in the second	and successful version of strike up the band in 1929	2126.9870415465493
7300. another song in strike up the band- i've got a crush	like the gershwins richard rodgers and	lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them	3239.608343611295
7301. if one	of mr rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than	interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure mr hart	was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance	in another show	6669.272746379036
7302. several of these double entries have been	collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney along with rodgers	and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york	and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly	heard rodgers and hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing	album		4115.876338650695
7303. altogether	fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by	a quintet of able vocalists	1259.3339413004696
7304. norman paris has provided them with extremely	effective orchestral accompanimen   turning to the current	musical season on broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals		has been transferred to an original cast album	that has some entertaining	moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited	by the show might lead one to expect	8073.9415094004635
7305. robert morse singing with comically	plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible	for the high spots in frank loesser's score	2321.5388919897027
7306. rudy	vallee who shares star billing with mr morse makes only two	appearances	1178.2887011218268
7307. he shares with mr morse a parody of the college anthems	he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia	martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice	3861.461593430408
7308. in general mr loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist	than he has as composer	2146.109794769281
7309. like mr loesser jerry herman	is both composer and lyriist for	c	but in this	case it is the music that stands above the lyrics	2596.644155041003
7310. for this story of	an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel mr herman	has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles	4653.546311373197
7311. there are the full-bodied resourceful	voices of robert weede mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the	most of mr herman's lilting melodies and for an occasional	change of pace the bright humor of molly picon	3849.731514328008
7312. mr herman has	managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american	ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both	idioms	4480.399006468276
7313. not content to create only the music and lyrics noe^l	coward also wrote the book and directed	a saga of life on a	cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr coward's more	memorable works	4057.0428430559673
7314. the melodies flow along pleasantly as mr coward's	songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut-to-a-familiar-pattern	quality	2595.3428431668535
7315. elaine stritch who sings with a persuasively	warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other	members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr coward's songs	3341.9897801903835
7316. with three fine russian films in recent months on world	war 2- the house i live in the cranes are flying	and ballad of a soldier- we had every right to expect	a real soviet block-buster in the day the war ended	6584.89037322409
7317. it	simply isn't not by a long shot	167.0233972043856
7318. the artkino presentation with english	titles opened on saturday at the cameo theatre	1181.0969718793972
7319. make no mistake this gorky studio drama is a respectable import-	aptly grave carefully	written performed and directed	1578.3556166972842
7320. in describing the initial allied	occupation of a middle-sized german city the picture has color pictorial	pull and genuinely moving moments	3045.417462771643
7321. told strictly from the viewpoint	of the russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over	the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple at both sides of the conflict's	aftermath	2987.0073741726465
7322. unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this	romance at the expense of everything else	1407.113621447867
7323. tenderly and rather tediously	the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse	and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they	don't want to hurt	3461.5115561331054
7324. it's the old story war or no war and more	than one viewer may recall hollywood's titanic several seasons	back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of	a society dilettante	5327.629092006793
7325. not that the picture is superficial	43.46400526289841
7326. under	yakov segal's direction it begins stirringly as crouching soviet	and nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first	surrender gesture	3481.4460421335752
7327. one high-up camera shot is magnificent as the germans	straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square	and drop their weapons	2200.8112720438407
7328. only	once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic	sense of sharing a rare experience	3289.077860755152
7329. ring of bright water by	gavin maxwell is just that- a haunting warmly personal chronicle	of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands	3125.3885635468823
7330. he has married me with h a ring of bright	water	begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title	and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the	author conveys	6078.170849706202
7331. the place is camusfearna the site of a long-vanished	sea-village opposite the isle of skye	1097.80764368936
7332. it is a land of long fjords	few people a single-lane road miles away- and of wild stags greylag	geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters	4667.092267064772
7333. how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna his furnishing	the empty house with beach-drift the subtle changes in season over	ten years is a moving experience	2862.376593496079
7334. just the evocations of time and	place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today	seems almost lost would be enough	3668.616359682454
7335. there	is mijbil an otter who travelled with maxwell- and gave maxwell's	name to a new species- from the tigris marshes to his london	flat	2611.0187488365214
7336. it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more	engaging animal in all literature	2349.927821145478
7337. this is not only a compliment to	mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings	in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened	otter cub's journey by plane from iraq to london then by train	to camusfearna with affectionate detail	5028.581870060227
7338. mij as his owner	was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits	954.9883598670774
7339. he liked to nip	ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth	787.0140918858096
7340. he preferred	sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow	756.3835509338318
7341. systematically he	would open and ransack drawers	93.99538597879999
7342. given a small ball or marbles he would	invent games and play by himself for hours	1880.8473987693774
7343. with curiosity and elan	he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself	for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting	with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell who nearly lost his life	in doing so	4607.5405665304415
7344. a year and a day of this idyll is described for the	reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality	is charted but self-discovery as well	4997.3154605132395
7345. in the solitude of camusfearna	there had been no loneliness	374.85581669594353
7346. to be quite alone where there	are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some	pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness h	a sharpening of the senses	5512.824576267473
7347. now with the increasing interdependence	between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need	that of being trusted implicitly by some creature	2455.7423429696582
7348. two other people	in time shared mijbil's love: h it remained around us three	that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable	world of wave and water h; we were his trinity and he behaved	towards us h with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation	7710.146564034672
7349. in turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his	worship	1259.8681476596796
7350. the brief details of mijbil's	death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy	2352.4107767553737
7351. man to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible	in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract	symbol of the savage in man	3445.1997611053644
7352. but then through a strange coincidence	maxwell manages to acquire idal a female otter and the fascinating	story starts once more	3056.40651564394
7353. one is not sure who emerges as	the main personality of this book- mijbil with his rollicking ways	or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller	and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an	unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid	and unabashed	5019.84311072037
7354. this reviewer read the book when it was first brought	out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement	2811.8586011670764
7355. now gavin	maxwell's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world	788.6192201226492
7356. the performances of the comedie francaise are the	most important recent events in the new york theater	2113.440284947061
7357. they	serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats	as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that	prevailed in the 17th century	2990.183501866257
7358. on the contrary the old plays are continually	being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has	only a brief history at the comedie	3933.620090442045
7359. of course the well-received	revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds	us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism	2323.812919749405
7360. the directors of	the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient	a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this	season closed their plays after one performance	5515.838833814746
7361. but they are aware	of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full	houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic	classic	2988.1847907577276
7362. in france novel approaches to the classic french	plays are frequently attempted	970.2601373672835
7363. the government pays a subsidy	for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who	sometimes put moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve	interesting results	2970.4707888709963
7364. so far as i know the comedie has never	put moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century but	they do reinterpret plays and characters	4111.374497186235
7365. last season the comedie's	two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can	expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine's phedre	and moliere's school for wives	3319.566795281994
7366. the new	phedre was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient greek;	perhaps that is the comedie's equivalent for thrusting this	play's characters into our own time	4478.3327055332065
7367. the speaking of the lines seemed	excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the	spirit of 17th century elegance	2186.4669602792305
7368. a few literary men defended what they	took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but	the response was mainly hostile and quite violent	4817.116706891074
7369. the new school	for wives was interpreted according to a principle that	is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy- the	idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character	3654.7770210501685
7370. among the moliere specialists of some years ago louis	jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while fernand ledoux	often performing at the comedie made them more gross than moliere may	have intended	5457.422290777067
7371. apparently jouvet and ledoux attempted just	these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in the school	for wives	1723.5203723246455
7372. i say apparently although i saw jouvet as	arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death; by	that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments	of the comedy	5749.294809190907
7373. arnolphe it will be recalled is a man	of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be	2023.8345362552288
7374. the part can lend itself to serious treatment; one influential	french critic remarked: pity for arnolphe comes with age	2598.008109687783
7375. accordingly at the comedie last year jean meyer played	a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into	a tragedy	2182.8986070323763
7376. but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the	play became only comedy acted rather slowly	2347.0531643868826
7377. wisely the comedie	has brought moliere's tartuffe on its tour and has left	the school for wives at home	1731.220341037936
7378. tartuffe is the religious hypocrite	who courts his benefactor's wife	555.2475198217203
7379. jouvet played him as a sincere	zealot and ledoux at the comedie made him a gross buffoon or	so the historians tell us	2339.2916257452443
7380. louis seigner who formerly played	the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux is the tartuffe of the present	production which he himself directed	3049.1254901596026
7381. his tartuffe observes the	golden mean	43.873569860785594
7382. his red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares	bespeak his sensuality	1187.3147192483225
7383. but his heavenward glances and his pious	speeches are not merely perfunctory; of course they do not reflect	sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his	pious impersonation	3649.481098892128
7384. occasionally seigner draws some justly	deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another	1892.414424019945
7385. the	whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone	who has seen seigner in his other parts	1884.9129440476572
7386. his normal specialty is playing	the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never	mean or sly	2370.361761316614
7387. here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of	meanness and slyness	644.7068769255874
7388. seigner is the dean of the company the	oldest actor in point of continuous service	1642.186642372411
7389. in that function he helps	to rebut another legend about the comedie	641.0718502553253
7390. we are often told that	the comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who	are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but	probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage	6057.236542816086
7391. seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the	company; among his other parts are the leads in the bourgeois	gentleman and the imaginary invalid	3125.823084720012
7392. in moliere's	farce the tricks of scapin robert hirsch undertakes	another of the great roles	1644.7670084330705
7393. here some innovation is attempted	14.983413976213678
7394. to begin with scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever	servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master	3696.799957718567
7395. hirsch's	scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical	agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he	serves	2187.7659063646493
7396. hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities	he has observed in the city toughs of the real world	3064.2249094305835
7397. and surely	his scapin has a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seems to	make him his own master and nobody's servant	2187.6347587937926
7398. django reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy was a true artist	one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and	flow into many channels	3899.4601809297587
7399. there is hardly a jazz guitarist in	the business today who doesn't owe something to django	1254.6942432427445
7400. and django	owed much to louis armstrong	139.76023555237578
7401. he told once of how he switched his	style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records	he bought in the flea market in paris	2975.2380213998686
7402. it was the first jazz he	had heard	251.2289507596509
7403. django who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in	belgium and who died in 1953 in france was an extraordinary man	1866.4384745961186
7404. most	of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep	with a cigarette	2350.6881869578697
7405. and this was before he began to play his startlingly	beautiful jazz	637.4248740476469
7406. you can catch up with him- if you haven't	already- on rca-victor's album	1191.0358516621131
7407. djangology made	up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of	the hot club of france	1724.8309654307348
7408. this is a choice item and grappely deserves	mention too of course	956.1669481901815
7409. he is one of the few men in history who	plays jazz on a violin	1090.6183120930145
7410. they play: minor swing honeysuckle	rose beyond the sea bricktop heavy	artillery djangology after you've gone where	are you my love	3054.2958499600745
7411. i saw stars lover man	menilmontant and swing 42	261.2650678726235
7412. all this is great	proceedings- get the minutes	249.7812517982291
7413. kid ory the trombonist chicken	farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz	1257.7346934935217
7414. he dates	back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans	1644.58431293293
7415. his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years	than he cares to remember	1578.9465135005516
7416. good time jazz has released a nice	two-record album which he made	969.8200327788394
7417. he is starred against alvin alcorn	trumpet; phil gomez clarinet; cedric haywood piano; julian	davidson guitar; wellman braud bass and minor hall drums	2317.243861354993
7418. the set contains high society do what ory	say down home rag careless love jazz me blues	weary blues original dixieland one-step bourbon	street parade panama toot toot tootsie	oh didn't he ramble beale street blues maryland	my maryland 1919 rag eh la bas mood	indigo and bugle call rag	7443.814018778966
7419. all this will serve	to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those	who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late	to lay hands on the gems	4111.8939908915245
7420. mischa elman shared last night's lewisohn stadium concert	with three american composers	961.0667625251169
7421. his portion of the program-	and a big portion it was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century	concertos for the violin: to wit the mendelssohn and the	tchaikovsky	2992.272265380777
7422. that is an evening of music-making that would faze many	a younger man; mr elman is 70 years old	2600.2892489900914
7423. there were	8000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they	heard elman	1249.9416923089702
7424. but with all due respects and allowances it must	truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet	more mannered than musical	3872.399805753283
7425. the occasion was sentimental; so was the	playing	166.76453259912756
7426. the american part of the evening consisted of paul	creston's dance overture william schuman's chester	from new england triptych and two works of wallingford riegger	dance rhythms	op 58 and a romanza for strings op	56a	5804.161476192232
7427. the creston is purely a potboiler with spanish english	french and american dances mixed into the stew	1426.985658457444
7428. the riegger	with its latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale;	like his sweet attractive romanza it belongs to what the composer	called his non-dissonant category of works	5001.040825022029
7429. the schuman	chester takes off from an old william billings tune with	rousing woodwind and brass effect	1427.4669106501535
7430. all these- potboilers	or no- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively	colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors	4118.72145232341
7431. it	was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change	640.6823720401317
7432. we have	alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well	as the lively performances of the stadium symphony	3269.5562674095645
7433. a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the	wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of a question of adultery	yesterday's new british import at the apollo	2977.129170430323
7434. since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation	that would often arise the film's extensive discussion of the	problem seems at best superfluous	4469.053897263162
7435. in its present artless low-budget	form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath	1099.2982533812851
7436. with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced	sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive	2116.8542770236754
7437. the explanation	offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage	to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile	accident	2865.2637071165877
7438. anthony steel as the husband is a jealous type	who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action	adulterous	3267.875888357794
7439. the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction	of don chaffey as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father	and anton diffring as an innocent bystander	3004.0671870824062
7440. after a protracted	hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language	than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one's surprise	leaves the legal question unresolved	4646.234182418102
7441. when the husband drops the case	and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in	the first place	2320.8720351255324
7442. for its final change of bill in its london season	the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one	of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the	royal opera house covent garden	5790.113068219487
7443. no doubt the underlying idea	was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished	its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased	3320.0172499558385
7444. and please it did in every sense of the word for it had	the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical	of london audiences	4663.879482372408
7445. at the end of the program indeed there was a	demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes and nothing could stop	it	2022.1900392353048
7446. alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic	technical bit from the closing number taras bulba but even	then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined	not to go home at all	5151.544821053999
7447. only a plea from the house manager john collins	finally broke up the party	940.6733681794882
7448. but for all the manifest	intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for	instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level	it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company	6799.253175966687
7449. the taras bulba excerpt is a rousing version of	gogol's ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music	of soloviev-sedoi	1875.1188162884569
7450. it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women	and it contains everything in the books- lusty comedy gregarious	cavorting and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt	to make the human body perform	5794.82695712502
7451. yuri soloviev oleg sokolov alexei	zhitkov lev sokolov yuri korneyev and mr livshitz were the	chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent	2321.241005993077
7452. at	the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus	ballet bayaderka which opened the evening	2590.6957852543414
7453. what	a man this petipa was! and why do we in the west know so few of	his ballets	1725.0674887202981
7454. this scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn	hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily	beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human-	which of course is altogether fitting	5632.020443813996
7455. the ensemble enters	in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness	and adagio is the general medium of the piece	2734.8868713450083
7456. its	ballerina olga moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and	ludmilla alexeyeva inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make	up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments	3711.011174859965
7457. sergei vikulov as the	lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the	work is designed to belong to the ladies	2487.222951624367
7458. the middle section	of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal	merit but all of them pretty good at that	3860.7495150420473
7459. vadim kalentiev was the	conductor	22.230071529446956
7460. it was quite an evening!	a year ago today when the democrats were fretting and frolicking	in los angeles and john f kennedy was still only an	able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility	of the presidency theodore h white had already compiled masses	of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960	5323.409365961255
7461. as the	pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated mr	white took more notes	1648.2259203455683
7462. he traveled alternately with mr kennedy	and with richard m nixon	505.297542479806
7463. he asked intimate questions	and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates'	in-groups	2354.56735576767
7464. he assembled quantities of facts about the nature	of american politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course	of the closest presidential election in american history	2987.9736140972273
7465. those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about	that election; how little we know of what there is to be known is	made humiliatingly clear by mr white in the making of the president	1960	6544.793808925258
7466. this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly	interesting one	379.24764514150974
7467. what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism	turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history	2118.5586152676033
7468. mr	white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter	651.2570234205557
7469. his	zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere	his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the	effectiveness of his book	4096.926483705746
7470. as a dramatic	narrative the making of the president 1960 is continuously	engrossing	793.7343178230037
7471. and as an introduction to american politics it is highly	educational	751.1926702969918
7472. the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr	kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns	1884.2973794370596
7473. he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential	hopefuls: five democrats- senator hubert h humphrey	senator stuart symington senator lyndon b johnson adlai	e stevenson and mr kennedy- and two republicans- governor	rockefeller and mr nixon	6356.584850341145
7474. then in chronological	order mr white covers the primary campaigns the conventions and	the presidential campaign itself	1423.2653779447726
7475. in the process he writes at length	about many related matters: the importance of race religion local	tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television	3689.972162841162
7476. mr white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions	260.71731469351073
7477. he frequently	cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's	mouth from numerous insiders and from mr kennedy himself; but	never from mr nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and	distrust	5645.283648284183
7478. rarely in american history has there been a political	campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less	says mr white	2016.5490681293625
7479. mr nixon he believes has no particular political	philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign	1419.3968998163598
7480. although a skillful	politician and a courageous and honest man mr nixon mr white	believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort	in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and	damaged his chances on television	4046.81924140834
7481. mr nixon is a broody	moody man given to long stretches of introspection; he trusts only	himself and his wife	2824.0753974697413
7482. h he is a man of major talent- but a man	of solitary uncertain impulses	1093.4311126957396
7483. h he was above all a friend seeker	almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked	1873.843874381892
7484. he wanted to identify	with people and have a connection with them; h the least inspiring	candidate since alfred m landon	2038.8759202633487
7485. mr kennedy	mr white believes had mastered politics on so many different	levels that no other	american could match him	2834.7731421189146
7486. calm dignified composed	superbly eloquent mr kennedy always knew everything	about everybody	642.1116128264214
7487. he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous	volunteers	956.1252917102709
7488. every decision was made quickly on sound grounds	167.43164893804516
7489. efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance	389.5544542447526
7490. mr kennedy	did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters	636.397324615464
7491. mr white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a	democrat himself who expects mr kennedy to be a fine president	3692.425832860447
7492. throughout the making of a president	mr white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on	candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and	illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play	key roles	4226.294192299486
7493. and he makes many interesting comments	65.4856757131176
7494. here are several:	the root question in american politics is always:	who's the man to see	1257.1765697109904
7495. to understand american politics is simply	to know people to know the relative weight of names- who are	heroes who are straw men who controls who does not	4433.086550763257
7496. but to operate	in american politics one must go a step further- one must build a	bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection	2744.5501934133217
7497. in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform	nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose	beyond expressing emotion	4436.89066127558
7498. all platforms are meaningless:	the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience	of the candidate the party chooses to lead it	2713.268008725718
7499. nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium which had begun with	the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night	continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an	evening of french operatic excerpts	5942.855551161087
7500. miss pons is certainly	not	70-no singer ever is- and yet the rewards of the evening again	lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in	present accomplishments	3637.916465361671
7501. the better part of gallantry might be perhaps	to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown	and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which	she had chosen to sing	6032.577670948024
7502. no orchestra however could be expected	to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as	miss pons encountered last night	2326.172094278514
7503. in all fairness there were flashes	of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate	vocalism	2594.583803327877
7504. one such moment came in the breathtaking way	miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer's shadow song	1409.4951827934906
7505. the years suddenly fell away at this point	248.374068462764
7506. on the whole however one	must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch	her own reputation as time marches inexorably on	2857.778378050309
7507. sharing	the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau	making his stadium debut on this occasion	2125.055608238357
7508. mr verreau began shakily	with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed	beyond middle volume	1571.217902026212
7509. later on this problem vanished and the flower	song from bizet's carmen was beautifully and intelligently	projected	2144.321934269386
7510. radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach	the minority listener	787.9560664015213
7511. lower costs and a larger number of stations	are the key factors making such specialization possible	1880.3274956922173
7512. the	mushrooming of fm outlets offering concerts	lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had	a fair amount of publicity	2331.326648779083
7513. not so well known is the growth	of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners-	an audience which in the united states comprises some 19000000	people with $20000000000 to spend each year	5504.631084972154
7514. of course	the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching	499.5456804254574
7515. he even	buys a lot of the products he sees advertised- despite the fact that	the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any	but white models in commercials	5475.8747142043585
7516. but the growing number of	negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support	of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they	approach new prospects	2966.6110693545806
7517. it is estimated that more than 600 stations	do a significant amount of programing for the	negro	2115.8233743410874
7518. at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this	audience in about half of the 50 states	1871.734088249593
7519. these and other figures	and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor	magazine a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers	3696.3360315848504
7520. for	10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics	of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching	this market through radio	2989.7200188319175
7521. in the past 10 years sponsor	observes these trends have become apparent:  negro population	in the us has increased 25 per cent while the white population	was growing by 18 per cent	5165.9671301781445
7522. the forgotten 15 million- as	sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey- has become	a better-remembered 19 million	1887.8998213172367
7523. advertisers are changing their	attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways	of speaking to it	2812.2671757828984
7524. stations programing to negro listeners	are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational	economic and cultural levels	2327.169062751538
7525. futhermore the station which	wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement	projects not simply serve on the air	3028.590641682736
7526. in the last decade	the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15	per cent and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per	cent according to a research man quoted by sponsor	3954.14722295205
7527. a year	ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which	the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business	3682.123832005058
7528. the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population	growth	500.88398123139024
7529. it also brought home proof of something a casual observer	might have missed: that more than half of the us negroes live	outside the southeastern states	4094.051776851182
7530. also the state with the largest	number of negroes is new york- not in the south at all	1571.373216889909
7531. in new york city wlib boasts more community service programs	than any other negro station and one of the largest negro	news staffs in america	3899.936679896997
7532. and wwrl's colorful mobile unit	cruising predominately negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder	of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests	2027.2061250010174
7533. recently wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases	of employment agency deceit	1394.8630103506075
7534. a half-dozen other stations in the new	york area also bid for attention of the city's negro population	up about 50 per cent in the past decade	2857.5251793306084
7535. in all big cities outside	the south and even in small towns within the south radio stations	can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners	4861.248262940745
7536. the keystone broadcasting system's negro network includes	360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total	us negro population	2023.9443366936835
7537. one question which inevitably	crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the	negro is moving into a fully integrated status	4115.734670177792
7538. whatever the	long-range impact of integration the owners of negro-appeal radio stations	these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal	2459.0966074675966
7539. advertisers	have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names	they have heard on stations catering to their special interests	3248.353483569862
7540. and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro	disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only	from a fact sheet	3006.190323794753
7541. what sets negro-appeal programing apart from	other radio shows	397.2825066316568
7542. sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular	negro bands and singers; rhythm-and-blues mood music; race	music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs	2318.4201494861313
7543. furthermore news	and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects	and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station	2592.0013018610225
7544. advertising	copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro	concern	501.457540343389
7545. sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony	station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious	of quality and and does not wish to be associated with radio	which is any way degrading to his race; he tends to shy away from the	hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio	programs famous	7944.788811125538
7546. the sociological impact is perhaps most	eloquently summed up in this quotation of j walter carroll of ksan	san francisco:   negro-appeal radio is more important	to the negro today because it provides a direct and powerful	mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements	and desires	4963.248111671861
7547. it will continue to be important as a means of orientation	to the negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make	adjustment to the urban life	4476.223996016553
7548. negro radio is vitally necessary during	the process of assimilation	373.8900413389768
7549. presentation of the life and times of john sloan in	the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human	values in art	3667.5561242064214
7550. staged by way of announcing the gift of a large	and intimate sloan collection by the artist's widow helen farr	sloan to the wilmington society of the fine arts the exhibition	presents a survey of sloan's work	3951.840801358912
7551. from early family portraits	painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of	the fine arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed	in his last year and still part of his estate	5912.612123065714
7552. few	artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they	lived	1254.407768688956
7553. few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with	so little bitterness	1650.8079529953939
7554. the paintings drawings prints and illustrations	all reflect the manners costumes and mores of america in the first	half of the present century	2325.5095765303076
7555. obviously sloan's early years	were influenced by his close friend robert henri	957.6460861898977
7556. as early as	1928 however the sloan style began to change	499.65903344923015
7557. the dark pigments of	the early work were superseded by a brighter palette	1187.9920579112763
7558. the solidity of	brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual	abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies	and studio nudes	2967.8248773310747
7559. the exhibition presents all phases of sloan's	many-sided art	390.9450357583763
7560. in addition to the paintings are drawings prints	and illustrations	378.56193960161784
7561. sloan created such works for newspaper supplements	before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the	streets of new york thereby building for america an incomparable	city survey from paintings of mcsorley's saloon to breezy clotheslines	on city roofs	6793.93449189651
7562. one of the most appealing of the rooftop	canvases is sun and wind on the roof with a woman and child	bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds	3116.839142982814
7563. although	there are landscapes in the show	the human element was the compelling	factor in sloan's art	2124.4998278699786
7564. significant are such canvases as	bleeker street saturday night with its typically american	crowd; the multifigure traveling carnival	in which action is vivified by lighting; or carmine	theater 1912 the only canvas with an ash can	although sloan was a member of the famous eight and of the	so-called ash-can school a term he resented	5278.336756528734
7565. not all	the paintings however are of cities	249.51736052629272
7566. the exhibition touches briefly	on his sojourn in the southwest	indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western		1099.1349538222792
7567. the fact that sloan was an extrovert	concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his	art as a human chronicle	3899.888716473114
7568. there are 151 items in the wilmington	show including one painting by each member of the eight	as well as work by sloan's friends and students	2753.2140323517046
7569. supplementing the	actual art are memorabilia- correspondence diaries books from the	artist's library etc	1419.42052749348
7570. all belong to the collection being given	to wilmington over a period of years by mrs sloan who has cherished	such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at	the art students league new york in the 1920's	4211.867123193782
7571. to	enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries the delaware	art center will maintain	a complete file of photographs of all sloan works as well as	a card index file	5183.5594517484815
7572. the entire sloan collection will be made available	at the center to all serious art students and historians	1572.4132217796873
7573. the	current exhibition which remains on view through oct 29 has tapped	14 major collections and many private sources	2602.4397458304256
7574. any musician playing beethoven here where beethoven was born	is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care	1727.0769814112584
7575. in	a sense he is offering bonn what its famous son	never did- the sound of the composer's mature style	2815.148464745312
7576. robert	riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded	23rd beethoven festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the	style	2325.107103652318
7577. his readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative	without being presumptuous	1415.432067898054
7578. the 32 c minor variations	with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another	leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline	2593.0453468931405
7579. the d minor sonata op 31 no 2 introduced by dynamically	shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative-	single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way	toward the idea to come	6034.884106224135
7580. these inwardly dramatic moments showed the	kind of opera style of which beethoven was genuinely capable	but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging	2966.3414848441744
7581. two late sonatas op 110 and 111 were played with similar insight	the disarming simplicities of the op 111 adagio made plain without	ever becoming obvious	4083.53497091904
7582. the two were separated from each other by	the six bagatelles of op 126	940.3735005870188
7583. herr riefling in everything he	gave his large beethoven hall audience proved himself as an interpreter	of unobtrusive authority	2583.537617974473
7584. volker wangenheim who conducted	bonn's sta^dtisches	orchester on the following evening made	one more conscious of the process of interpretation	1889.4990360777083
7585. herr wangenheim	has only recently become the city's music director and is a young	man with a clear flair for the podium	3283.565426195187
7586. but he weighted the eighth	symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed	considerably at odds with the music	1873.9674106962707
7587. he might have been hoping to all	appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction	with the choral fantasy at the end of the program could amount	to something like the ninth; but no amount of head-tossing could	make it so	6410.934663275986
7588. the conductor's preoccupation with the business	of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first	orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto but when he put	his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed	it did so with plenty of spring	4767.289965473273
7589. the concerto's soloist	hans richter-haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though	without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on	the previous evening by herr riefling	4671.831803179702
7590. his was a burgomaster's	beethoven solid and sensible	166.6858670398223
7591. everybody returned after intermission	for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano chorus	and orchestra in c minor made up by its composer to fill	out one of his programs	4991.067040046129
7592. the entrance of the sta^dtisches gesangverein	was worth all the waiting however as the	young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life	2329.5342291371157
7593. the	last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most	compositional categories brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester	and rundfunkchor to bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance	of the missa solemnis	5163.320285094358
7594. a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray	resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood	on the shell of a great tortoise	3451.792875269206
7595. this theory eventually proved inexact	22.169144798673234
7596. but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known	bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science	2462.771117921846
7597. it is the business of cosmologists the scientists who	study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great	cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors	5495.11444081252
7598. these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy	principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain	phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge	3224.291238513708
7599. in	the autumn of 1959 the british broadcasting corporation presented	a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology	2827.5580467348204
7600. three	of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other	acted as a moderator	1415.0196625786189
7601. the participants were professor h bondi	professor of mathematics at king's college london; dr w	b bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college	london; dr r a lyttleton a lecturer at st john's	college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the	university of cambridge; and dr g j whitrow reader	in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology	london	8657.21519068597
7602. dr whitrow functioned as moderator	14.967658070875265
7603. the	programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments	have been published in a totally engrossing little book called rival	theories of cosmology	4293.256413746937
7604. dr bonnor begins with	a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on	the general theory of relativity	1888.9323948609222
7605. first of all and this has been calculated	by observation the universe is expanding- that is the galaxies	are receding from each other at immense speeds	4108.684222190398
7606. because of this	dr bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated	by stars and whatever else is there	2034.8733336148366
7607. this expansion has been going	on for an estimated eight billion years	962.1908590928031
7608. dr bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts	that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and	reverse itself and that the contraction will set in	3440.6022258667194
7609. then after many	more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a	common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again	4093.503317988211
7610. professor bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory	94.83682837301055
7611. he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually	being created in space	1651.7411143409856
7612. for this reason he says the density	of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are	zooming away in all directions	2471.0213161859924
7613. new galaxies are forever being formed	to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies	1885.8919936864197
7614. if this	is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years	ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe	is expanding	3461.9739087037533
7615. for new galaxies to be created professor bondi	declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be	created in an area the size of your living room once every few million	years	5790.112115523201
7616. he contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on	which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because	some slight error must be assumed in such experiments	3224.395272777266
7617. dr	lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe	and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons	3498.5173087877533
7618. protons	and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract	each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen-	the basic building block of matter	3322.566441574255
7619. the charges of the electron	and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr	lyttleton is not so sure	3260.7836466725134
7620. suppose says dr lyttleton the proton	has a slightly greater charge than the electron		539.0738346690385
7621. this would give the hydrogen atom a slight	charge-excess	396.39568340615295
7622. now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface	of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the	gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms	in the sphere	4034.1318355020862
7623. because electrical forces are far	more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot	away from the sphere	2606.503358328161
7624. dr lyttleton then imagines the universe	as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from	it	1574.0852856047854
7625. this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the	universe	960.2399518259479
7626. this slim book while giving the	reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the	universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has	2746.2756237393864
7627. several	photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with	the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors	were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost	every field	5927.462396684918
7628. it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists	of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made	satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up	new vistas to science	3673.2314915562993
7629. presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet	rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation	1636.0422183995775
7630. these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the	earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic	theories	2343.329888140653
7631. there would seem to be some small solace in	the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time	accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought	ladder from which to peer at alien regions	6550.3117025459815
7632. in doing away with	the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed	a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos	2616.11096985831
7633. and although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even	now be finding its match in the imagination of man	3024.7974763861944
7634. roots the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th	st	which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual	and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl	3588.50227490538
7635. highly successful	in england before its transfer to new york most of roots is	as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are	gaudy	4287.991275954069
7636. only in its final scene where beatie bryant	shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual	lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile	the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch	for most of the first two and one-half acts	4947.880031076109
7637. the burden of mr	wesker's message is that people living close to the soil	are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people	city-bred intellectuals imagine	4102.840518879888
7638. rather they are genuine clods proud	of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating	influences of aesthetics or thought	1888.3365819195885
7639. they care no more for politics	says mr wesker than they do for a symphony	1646.1162111434346
7640. seeming to have roots	in the soil they actually have none in life	784.3314438429109
7641. they dwell in short	in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are	commonly reported to have lived	3266.048260492852
7642. but this is a theme which does	not take so much time to state as mr wesker dedicates to it	1879.7295096675898
7643. so	much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest	of the theatergoer		966.55765752769
7644. the messy meals the washing	of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such	a thing as redundancy	2184.471324332554
7645. now for the good points	22.252585470472134
7646. miss doyle	as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a	warm smile	1584.2116742642183
7647. she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has	become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie	and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating	including a dose of good british socialism	6357.373957681823
7648. but while she	is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open	before her ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and	instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull	he sends beatie a letter of dismissal	5085.774460195762
7649. beatie getting	no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she	has lost a lover she has gained her freedom	3477.2333217038286
7650. despite a too long sustained	declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see	why british audiences apparently were impressed by roots	2320.8933547676675
7651. there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including	william hansen's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic	father and katherine squire's vigorous characterization of a farm	mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter or anyone	else	6313.162595096661
7652. but i am afraid mr wesker's meat and potatoes dish	isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences	1410.1592850900017
7653. shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain	that disrupted wednesday night's much ado about nothing opening	the season of free theatre in central park	4278.930379315216
7654. the new	york shakespeare festival which is using the wollman memorial skating	rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed	began bravely	2478.0765351191244
7655. joseph papp impassioned founder of the festival and	director of much ado had a vibrant colorful production under	way	2597.253579140571
7656. using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with	shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture	1411.0016717079404
7657. the audience	filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto	the lawns outside the fence	2375.804911567323
7658. the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick	so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised	chuckles	1882.4333231560224
7659. the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges also	familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of	writers' heads evoked laughter	4087.1895600795483
7660. the vivacity of the masquers'	party at leonato's palace with the spanish motif in the music and	dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon cast a spell of	delight	3326.263268839123
7661. as much ado turned serious while the insipid	claudio rejected hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall	2596.8354368513183
7662. at	first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas	were opened	942.6183812827132
7663. but the rain came more heavily and men and women in	light summer clothes began to depart	2137.290336371447
7664. the grieving hero and her father	leonato followed by the friar left the stage	944.4448872914411
7665. a voice on the	loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance	would resume in ten minutes	2821.788895134602
7666. more than half the audience departed	44.131938345109305
7667. some remained in the wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats	or with newspapers to cover their heads	1897.8232893894915
7668. others huddled under the trees	outside the fence	168.27511719528826
7669. twenty minutes after the interruption although	it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth	act where it had been stopped	4084.7429123775946
7670. beatrice and	benedick took their places on the stage	263.1651164261174
7671. in their	very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus	had foreseen this moment	2120.68466364714
7672. said benedick: lady beatrice	have you wept all this while	371.78596318807934

7675. the gallant company completed act 4	and got through part of act 5	1182.3495347735486
7676. but the final scenes could not	be played	166.67258384640198
7677. if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour	are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort	3450.6347659238563
7678. the parks department has done an admirable	job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare	1107.4782704101015
7679. one could	hardly blame newbold morris the parks commissioner for devoting	so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short	notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony	its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the	villains	7013.727931414796
7680. eldon elder who designed the stage also created	a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background	and shakespeare's lighthearted mood	2331.913861176599
7681. mr papp has directed a	performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious	business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style	would be preferable	4863.202653082714
7682. elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at	hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints	2031.2327291345507
7683. still a demurrer or two must be entered	249.99941528407385
7684. schwarzkopf is	of course schwarzkopf	14.783251238505192
7685. for style and assurance for a supreme and	regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her	2593.2317843801984
7686. if the voice	is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful	instrument controlled and flexible	2313.850393390176
7687. put to the service of lieder	of schubert brahms strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical	way it made its effect with ease and precision	4085.407845824558
7688. but what has	been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism	640.8241310626208
7689. instead	of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical	expression miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic	sin of artistic pride- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads	a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the	music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch	imposed from the outside	8350.649846477761
7690. the symptoms saturday night were	unmistakable	43.42054729777726
7691. clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little	too melodramatic	964.2996425099478
7692. there was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh	there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in	the interest of effect	3235.764514178371
7693. the result was like that of a beautiful painting	with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness	3245.979487387669
7694. there were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes	the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication	1570.046841165028
7695. miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist john wustman often achieved	the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition	2360.211379808886
7696. all the more	reason why there should have been no place for the frills; miss	schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them	2458.7959088924936
7697. the dance dancers and dance enthusiasts	had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night	than all had had two nights earlier when stadium concerts presented	the first of two dance programs	5785.9260013860785
7698. on saturday the orchestra	was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently	in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved	2997.440185336306
7699. there was additionally a bonus for the saturday-night	patrons	392.7136225253157
7700. alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first	new york performance of mr ailey's roots of the blues	a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival	3556.1027919826897
7701. otherwise the program included as on thursday the	taras-tchaikovsky design for strings the dollar-britten	divertimento the dollar-de banfield the duel and	the pas de deux from the nutcracker	4496.623811303286
7702. maria tallchief	and erik bruhn who danced the nutcracker pas de deux were	also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from don quixote	another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely	3538.4792438843833
7703. among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening	elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in	their roles in the duel a work that depends so much upon the	precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants	6203.944390246358
7704. mr	ailey's roots of the blues an earthy and very human modern	dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of	the evening	2470.100563810682
7705. as brother john sellers sang five blues	to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep	shepard mr ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile	dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and	ecstatic	6041.1543920953
7706. their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm	fan	505.0534972204342
7707. he wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive	in a yellow and orange dress	2366.5318017553914
7708. the cat-like sinuousness	and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and	slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes	almost frightening tensions	3205.895601873268
7709. roots of the blues may	not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super-charged impact	2128.712383487514
7710. perhaps it is better to stay at home	166.32891171579132
7711. the armchair traveler	preserves his illusions	65.38837788389012
7712. this somewhat cynical comment may	be found in blue skies brown studies a collection of travel	essays by william sansom who would never consider staying home for	long	2983.442201463788
7713. mr sansom is english bearded formidably cultivated the	versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and	of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something	midway between	5302.821421884111
7714. the only man alive who seems qualified by	his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance	of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell	mr sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration	worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of	a hungarian beauty and an american multimillionaire		4664.834991780795
7715. the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible	if taken in too thick slices	2344.954466520783
7716. there are sixteen essays	in blue skies brown studies	260.84600287782115
7717. most of them were written between	1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines	1637.6186890115857
7718. all	are well written and are overwritten	94.16330817685682
7719. but even if mr sansom labors	too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from	his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can	charm and astound	5166.694370222659
7720. too many books and articles are just assembled by	putting one word after another	943.3770237053213
7721. mr sansom actually writes his	with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense	relish in all the metaphorical resources of english with a thick shower	of sophisticated cultural references	5323.4614268480955
7722. i like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells	and looks like its color its particular kind of life	2185.903783584962
7723. this is	an exact description of what mr sansom does	560.3778607664892
7724. he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches	an individual or quotes his opinions	1418.3933686727964
7725. it is an over-all impression	mr sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details	of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture	and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere	and of echoes of the past	6665.683369164867
7726. william sansom writes only about	europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london	vienna the french riviera and the norwegian fjords	2618.4734814059525
7727. but no	matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original	mind and his own sensitive reactions	3073.602605314831
7728. a writer lives at best in	a state of astonishment he says	642.9072964076438
7729. beneath any feeling he has of	the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it	all	3487.0632776434045
7730. to transmit that feeling he writes	43.868791844314906
7731. this may not be true of	many writers but it certainly is true of mr sansom	1872.7432600274315
7732. mr sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular	way which recalls the statues of bernini	and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto	3039.6879901065086
7733. he can coin a neat phrase:	a street spattered with an invigoration of people; tulips	with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears; after a	snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity	3682.275643317896
7734. and for	all his lacquered almost byzantine self-consciousness he can make	one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison	2597.856852005184
7735. from afar	in one of his best essays mr sansom expresses	his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio	himself that dot the environs of vicenza	3100.5849100602613
7736. nice even if a trifle gaudy	43.73262472764245
7737. blue skies	brown studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs	563.3657533021534
7738. in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over	the absence of original drama on television but not for years have	many regretted the passing of new plays on radio	3212.6518130892337
7739. wbai the listener-supported	outlet on the frequency-modulation band has decided	to do what it can to correct this aural void	2816.2093830348026
7740. yesterday it offered	poised for violence by jean reavey	261.7623139627913
7741. wbai is on	the right track: in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis	on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre	as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue	to demonstrate	6236.815374367542
7742. unfortunately poised for violence was not	the happiest vehicle with which to make the point	1092.5815576059535
7743. mrs	reavey's work is written for the stage- it is mentioned for an off-broadway	production in the fall- and in addition employs an avant-garde	structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension	is to be encouraged	5922.231664090686
7744. the play's device is to explore society's	obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group	of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting	rather than just be themselves	3547.2306675701775
7745. in a succession of scenes they appear	in different guises- patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and	participants in a family picnic- but in each instance they inevitably	put ugliness before beauty	5443.21722270769
7746. somewhere in mrs reavey's	play there is both protest and aspiration of merit	789.7458831079476
7747. but its relentless	discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that	after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt	3506.47352114694
7748. moreover	her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous	assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own	right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills	3230.631530775998
7749. but quite	conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the	work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve	the burden on the author's words	5007.8429784383525
7750. which in itself is an immediate	reward of the wbai experiment; good radio drama has its own	special demands that badly need reinvigoration	2332.4498143501287
7751. a weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere	archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music	is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month	4287.386170702549

7753. the enterprising program is heard saturday	afternoons on radio station wqxr	756.2668311046762
7754. the brief notes	introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and	many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by	the hand through an often difficult maze	3241.334661487659
7755. the show is programed and	written by the station's assistant continuity editor chuck briefer	1411.9538375678032
7756. the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings	642.6330003744035
7757. last saturday's interesting melange included ernst toch	karlheinz stockhausen richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from	a new space opera by the swedish composer karl-birger blomdahl	4127.056604424981
7758. other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american	composer a particular type of music or the music of a given	country	2333.4480233492313
7759. it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is	set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene	2599.8940859675467
7760. but	one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of	the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera that further opportunity	would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety	and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions	4983.520199975943
7761. the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square	garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before	it brings its long american tour to a close	4654.5076019949765
7762. it is not simply	giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york	engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers	that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's	heart	4516.403881199012
7763. it is good to see those numbers again	249.74700049107523
7764. so for that matter are the newer	dances- the kalmuk dance with its animal movements that genial	juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called the platter the	rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called summer the	three shepherds of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs	and of course the trenchant rock 'n' roll	7506.4880356953
7765. as autumn starts its annual sweep few americans and canadians realize	how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring	2168.255763211614
7766. spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire	land surface of the earth	1882.592736187204
7767. the only other regions so blessed are the	british isles western europe eastern china southern chile and	parts of japan new zealand and tasmania	2459.2805891234316
7768. their autumn tints are	all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson gold	purple bronze blue and vermilion that flame up in north america	4266.91898745244
7769. jack frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle;	in fact a freezing autumn dulls the blaze	1734.4026049827796
7770. the best effects come	from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain	followed by sunny days and cool nights	3267.7037295706564

7857. ago it was bruited that the primary character	in erich	maria remarque's new novel was based on the marquis alfonso	de portago the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia	automobile race of 1957	3857.560090673014
7858. if this was in fact mr remarque's	intention he has achieved a notable failure	1413.7345561381994
7859. clerfayt of heaven	has no favorites resembles portago only in that he is male and	a race-driver- quite a bad race-driver whereas portago was a good	one	2888.64039314378
7860. he is a dull unformed and aimless person; the twelfth marquis	de portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate	2367.9018215021174
7861. one	looked forward to mr remarque's ninth book if only because	not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile	racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised	3581.969310108188
7862. unhappily	heaven has no favorites does not alter the record except to	add one more bad book to the list	2853.0386424002604
7863. mr remarque's conception	of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble	640.6151650411472
7864. he proposed throwing	together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced	on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery	3903.742551548764
7865. his	treatment of it is something else	93.7192253811009
7866. his heroine chooses to die- the	price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being	higher than she wishes to pay	3679.054139989649
7867. her lover precedes her in death at	the wheel and presumably he too has chosen	1101.7949037441344
7868. between the first meeting	of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement mr remarque	has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse some demure	and rather fetching love-making pleasant talk about some of the	countryside and restaurants of europe and a modicum of automobile racing	6912.450522413313
7869. the ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing;	the love-making perhaps because it is pale and low-key when	one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is	often charming; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality	4547.7328902974805
7870. this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and	it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author	drawn clerfayt as say a tournament golfer	4852.274205421743
7871. hazards to life and	limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant	942.172644899475
7872. race-drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit	and since it was obviously mr remarque's intention to establish	automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have	expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques	but of mores and attitudes	7108.674060696561
7873. the jacket biography describes	him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although	i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records	or the literature	3458.1605600785597
7874. perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal	253.53103671843473
7875. the	book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary	for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities	of racing	2971.8600383626717
7876. the necessity is not clear to me and in any case	to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car	which or whom he calls giuseppe parked on the place vendome	sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around	him is not a liberty; it is an absurdity	7624.766585297529
7877. but it is in the	matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of	the book that remarque's failure is plainest	2323.850572394285
7878. clerfayt is neurotic	preoccupied and passive	65.61514752728952
7879. to be human he believes is to seek one's	own destruction: the freudian death-wish cliche inevitably	cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers	2318.763903876031
7880. in point of fact	the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy	technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the	passion they feel for the work by which they live	5652.875508541858
7881. a clerfayt may moon	on about the face of death in the cockpit; a portago could say	as he did say to me if i die tomorrow still i have had twenty-eight	wonderful years; but i shan't die tomorrow; i'll live	to be 105	4531.422040394805
7882. clerfayt transported may think of the engine	driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood	2126.2659659605556
7883. the italian	master piero taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy	though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles	an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae	3975.221706800318
7884. clerfayt	driving	sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell;	the briton stirling moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all	time believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related	to ballet	5792.11554390315
7885. errors in technical terminology suggest that	the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything	mr remarque hoped to tell us	2309.9741537508876
7886. however my principal	objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers	pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine-masters	of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists	5335.405488936923
7887. is leaderless according to this book	43.43086137660119
7888. in	contrast	the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev tito	and mao	1875.0034479959293
7889. against this invincible determination to communize the	whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals	and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common	good of all	3637.256830599811
7890. it is field marshal montgomery's belief that	in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really	care about democracy or christianity; about 30 per cent call themselves	christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered	respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and	believers in democracy	8045.766581800109
7891. but these western countries do care	about themselves	168.66906764362176
7892. if say the russians	intended to stop tom jones' going to the pub then tom jones	would fight the commies	2822.2355433622565
7893. but he would fight for his own liberty rather	than for any abstract principle connected with it- such as cause	1871.6112152926864
7894. for all practical purposes the west stands disunited undedicated	and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership	2131.8480260956267
7895. with	this barrage montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the	blunderings of the west	1093.3452349964355
7896. never given to mincing words he places heavy	blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly	america	2603.878197991732
7897. at war's end leadership in western europe passed	from britain because the labour government devoted its attention	to the creation of a welfare state	2459.488303210534
7898. with britain looking inward overseas	problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united	states	2359.308482792105
7899. montgomery believes that she started well	43.337266852411304
7900. america	gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend	and foe alike	1407.2145642827975
7901. she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into	prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace	1732.289548893407
7902. america has divided more than she has united the west	568.1472876715636
7903. the reasons	are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with	dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked	2175.184247772646
7904. however she	really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by	a quality of leadership that is basically needed	3678.8901628862577
7905. but the greater	reason for fumbling stumbling american leadership is due to the	shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor	2458.5773519063714
7906. they are determined montgomery writes not to be surprised	again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not	only unnecessary but also creates nervousness h among other nations	in the western alliance- not to mention such great suspicions among	the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful	coexistence or disarmament is not possible	8347.800402736904
7907. the net result	is that under american leadership the general world situation has	become bad	1102.6969553554336
7908. to monty the american people who in two previous	world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the	nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war	5478.370237146659
7909. faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states	must be relied upon to lead	1253.9696254712221
7910. the path to leadership is made clear	141.5999958260929
7911. montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west's own	house in order	1101.4724203890632
7912. such a man must be able and willing to give clear and	sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations	will have absolute confidence	4830.293066522015
7913. such a leader	must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity	about which it has always talked	2338.861249872489
7914. after drastically overhauling nato	western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that	tear apart the east and west	1735.9573354186864
7915. major to this effort is to get all	world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970	2593.432124307371
7916. the	west should make the central proposal; but the east would have	to show sincerity in carrying it out	1723.6552062049814
7917. but where is the	leader who will handle all these things for us	1179.635810012202
7918. montgomery knew	all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy	642.8208557753785
7919. the man whom he	would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle	1891.925198807318
7920. he alone	has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach	a decision	1262.9595497626265
7921. but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france's	lost soul	1182.9628991401707
7922. whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous	path to leadership	504.0580109534678
7923. the leader montgomery envisages will need	to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life	allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans	to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency	and be honest and morally proper	6439.110841996768
7924. all in all montgomery calls for a	leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him	1564.2304950344335
7925. as far back as moses thence to cromwell	napoleon lincoln churchill and nehru montgomery attempts	to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men	3689.081278141081
7926. he believes that	greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented	by churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history	as a political failure if it had not been for hitler's war	4223.528555117314
7927. however montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory	and practice	565.6881264308132
7928. most of what is said about his great men of history	has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary	scene	2734.852074422211
7929. like eisenhower he holds the militarist's suspicion	of politicians	388.3003033380136
7930. however at the same time montgomery selects as	his hero de gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions	1880.8543940353247
7931. monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement	and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support	2364.474207721525
7932. for the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access	by the reader to his true thoughts	1728.381392339127
7933. nevertheless montgomery	has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world	1189.702766766089
7934. it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership	934.5223047149373
7935. and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form	can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the	current shape of events	4313.796002441369
7936. no common thing for a listener	to hear a singer live for the first time only after he	has died	1892.593903609015
7937. but then mario lanza was no common singer and his whole	career public and non-public was studded with the kind of unconventional	happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital	only when he has ceased to be a living voice	6576.595838580111
7938. it is a kind	of justice too that it should originate in london's royal albert	hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers	have entertained the thousands it will accommodate		2572.7237201209564
7939. to be sure lanza made numerous concert	tours here and abroad but these did not take him to new york	where the carping critic might lurk	4100.520756602475
7940. the reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving	public the	horse-playing public- all these and others fill substantial roles	in us life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating	public	3692.375269023412
7941. the department of agriculture averaged out us	food consumption last year at 1488 lbs per person which allowing	for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry	every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow	down 8 lbs or more a day	7445.168358958236
7942. that mother hen of the weight-height	tables the metropolitan life insurance co clucks that 48 million	americans are overweight	1720.759422783136
7943. through previous centuries eating	changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just	getting enough	1649.2006443296148
7944. now big forces buffet food	14.78734237720561
7945. for the first time in history	the us has produced a society in which less than one-tenth	of the people turn out so much food that the government's most	embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million	tons of surplus farm produce	6772.38731936667
7946. in this same society the plain citizen	can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than	he can consume	2325.4972703420162
7947. refrigeration automated processing and packaging	conspire to defy season and banish spoilage	963.5873764018755
7948. and in the wake of the new	affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american	interest in how what people eat affects their health	2850.1145978120167
7949. to eat is human	the nation is learning to think to survive divine	1181.5352892595654
7950. not all the concern for health is well directed	262.15709265533843
7951. from the fusty	panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the us has progressed	to curds concentrates and capsules	2360.8854909987094
7952. each year reports the american	medical association ten million americans spend $900 million on	vitamins tonics and other food supplements	1884.0337446582776
7953. at juice bars in los	angeles' 35 health stores a new sensation is a pink high-protein	cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry-flavored	no-cal which sells for 59 per 8-oz glass	5350.753157199539
7954. grocery stores	sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all	1241.5196786156537
7955. but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet	and health and a big group of us scientists wants to supply	them	4098.177313704184
7956. the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university	of minnesota's physiologist ancel keys 57 inventor of the wartime	k ration and author of last year's bestselling	eat well and stay well	3754.626840291894
7957. from his birch-paneled office in the	laboratory of physiological hygiene under the university's football	stadium in minneapolis	blocky grey-haired dr keys directs an ambitious $200000-a-year	experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations	and is still growing	6204.929515106189
7958. pursuing it he has logged 500000 miles suffered	indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected	physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10000 individuals	from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini	3354.384411811745
7959. he has measured	the skinfolds of neapolitan	firemen studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters analyzed	the mealie-meal eaten by capetown coloreds and experimented	on minneapolis businessmen	4105.092613055478
7960. keys's findings	though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche	941.8452603981061
7961. vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on		658.7464571825698
7962. readings of the number of milligrams	of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting	heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram	which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack	4041.1911086004934
7963. already	many an american knows his count and rejoices or worries depending	on whether it is nearer 180	2353.3044801459882
7964. out	of cholesterol come keys's main messages so far:    americans	eat too much	787.9518349084201
7965. the typical us daily menu says dr	keys contains 3000 calories should contain 2300	1410.9896351438063
7966. and extra weight	increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack	939.2811016873175
7967. americans eat too much fat	22.170274481153665
7968. with meat milk butter	and ice cream the calorie-heavy us diet is 40% fat and most	of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind says dr keys	that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary	disease	4037.0260926888136
7969. throughout much of the	world food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population	has trouble getting the 1600 calories a day necessary to sustain life	4479.8964072815625
7970. the deficiency diseases- scurvy tropical sprue pellagra- run	rampant	262.1232189524283
7971. in west africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies	must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals	a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or red johnny a growth-stunting	protein deficiency	that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites	and lingering tropical disease	7804.505874372869
7972. in the well-fed us	deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years	943.0798867927251
7973. today	as harrison's principles of internal medicine a standard	internist's text puts it the most common form of malnutrition	is caloric excess or obesity	3693.1147545160006
7974. puritan new england regarded	obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin	1104.788796426637
7975. says	keys: maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral	the fat man would start to think	2828.912085441712
7976. morals aside the fat man	has plenty to worry about- over and above the fact that no one any	longer loves him	2181.1997951752796
7977. the simple mechanical strain of overweight says new	york's dr norman jolliffe can overburden and damage the	heart for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac	body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it	was built	7082.541746388735
7978. the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to	pay higher premiums	946.1655982555834
7979. he has- for unclear reasons- a 25% higher	death rate from cancer	963.9471587947171
7980. he is particularly vulnerable to diabetes	43.25158811786818
7981. he	may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess	body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement	2820.403918628754
7982. physiologically people overeat because what dr jolliffe	calls the appestat is set too high	939.8396966218576
7983. the appestat which adjusts	the appetite to keep weight constant is located says jolliffe	in the hypothalamus- near the body's temperature sleep and water-balance	controls	3886.7834454305157
7984. physical exercise raises the appestat	14.889871200295522
7985. in moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances	appetite; but because liquor	has a high caloric value- 100 calories per oz- the heavy	drinker is seldom hungry	4495.82921018002
7986. in rare cases diseases such as encephalitis	or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying	nearly all sense of satiety	2179.536648062068
7987. far more frequently	overeating	is the result of a psychological compulsion	754.274213529429
7988. it	may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity- or in children	simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging	2036.6367194545558
7989. some	families place undue emphasis on food: conversations center on it	and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment	3054.430118146508
7990. the	result says jolliffe: the child gains the feeling that food	is the purpose of life	1254.2802485781592
7991. food may act as a sedative giving temporary	emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does	2143.3556665073843
7992. reports	dr keys: a fairly common experience for us is the wife who	finds her husband staying out more and more	2029.4093765669957
7993. he may be interested in	another woman or just like being with the boys	1422.760215981538
7994. so she fishes around	in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake	794.1531594411423
7995. it's a matter of	boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something	because she's being deprived of something else	3257.6700621629525
7996. for the	army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers and the gobblers to	the downright gluttons- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely	won	2867.7257258883938
7997. physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants	as the amphetamines	as dangerous crutches	for a weak will	2127.512131983267
7998. keys has no such objections to metrecal	quaker oats's quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are	currently winning favor from dieters	2169.9218720800595
7999. metrecal is a pretty complete	food he says	250.64142772564142
8000. it contains large amounts of protein vitamins	and minerals	262.5034134263668
8001. in the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose	weight on it- 20 30 or 40 lbs	2605.2385515136634
8002. but keys worries that the	metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological	adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food	2596.4735381620008
8003. despite his personal distaste for obesity	dr keys has only an incidental interest	in how much americans eat	2355.652898643392
8004. what concerns him much more is the relationship	of diet to the nation's no 1 killer: coronary artery disease	which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills	500000 americans a year- twice the toll from all varieties of	cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents	4963.877950298525
8005. cholesterol	the cornerstone of dr keys's theory is a mysterious	yellowish	waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol	2128.1302995360415
8006. scientists	assume that cholesterol	is somehow necessary for the formation of	brain cells since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total	solid weight	2605.9865437147264
8007. they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones	393.77256132199506
8008. they	suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and	they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the	circulatory system	2851.8076696792677
8009. but they cannot fully explain the process of its	manufacture by the human liver	1406.5166415843785
8010. although the fatty protein molecules	carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble	cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the	body	2988.036976705388
8011. a remarkable substance says dr keys quite apart	from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries	2564.951384292968
8012. when thus deposited keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible	for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks	1728.0870597759226
8013. explains	keys: as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream	they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery	3694.6514798936596
8014. the proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left	behind	792.7484796130267
8015. as cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the	artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation	2585.9129665660425
8016. eventually says keys one of two things happens	167.08630996734945
8017. a clot forms	at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes	a heart attack	2824.1715599463814
8018. or the deposits themselves	get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that	an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied	by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured	4230.254697897636
8019. ordinarily the human liver synthesizes	only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation	of fats and for production of bile	3246.4317589563175
8020. even eggs and other cholesterol-rich	foods eaten in normal amounts says dr keys do not materially	affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood	2457.7877232273813
8021. during world war 2 doctors in the netherlands	and scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses of nazi	occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping	4834.57836939632
8022. not until long after the war- 1950 in fact- did they get	a hint of the reason	1402.0376494191423
8023. that year sweden's haqvin malmros showed	that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe	restrictions on fatty foods	2827.519193673349
8024. that same year the university of california's	dr laurance kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood	fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood	cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to	rise	4037.0244085074314
8025. here keys and others such as dr a e ahrens of	the rockefeller institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference	between vegetable and animal fats- and even between different	varieties of each	5332.44251434737
8026. all natural food fats fall into one of three	categories- saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated	941.6452173452024
8027. the	degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the	fat molecule	1649.262427511038
8028. saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens	94.19607466640181
8029. mono-unsaturated	fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule	and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens	3495.2353275635833
8030. the three fats have similar caloric values	but each exerts a radically different influence on	blood cholesterol	1415.760920286672
8031. as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is	much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed	3664.6602900115117
8032. just what	is meant by spirit and by matter	262.2852209902155
8033. the terms are generally	taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic	elements in the common experience of all	3250.0728254905052
8034. yet in the contemporary	context this is precisely what one must not do	791.2098255022743
8035. for in the modern world	neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon	elements of experience	2118.9567695635797
8036. we are in a transitional stage in which	many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected	2178.2943387120295
8037. when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional	meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions	and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours	5464.70392175633
8038. one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the	almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit	1721.5540513749816
8039. just a few centuries	ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of	material entities	2838.9576167209443
8040. not only in popular thought but in that of the highly	educated as well was this true	1402.7153638769387
8041. demons fairies angels and a host	of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential	world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars	4649.425529695564
8042. in such a world	the words matter and spirit both referred to directly	known realities in the common experience of all	2034.8761107222497
8043. in it important elements	of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general	which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally	and spontaneously	4639.779162811601
8044. the progress of science over these last	few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific	categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world	of the entities which previously populated it	3852.488219873241
8045. in carrying out this	program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service	for which it can claim due credit	2819.726384993683
8046. the objectification of the world	of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the	experience of spirit could justify or support	2463.070504867742
8047. science is fully competent	to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object	in space and time	2812.111675344641
8048. when therefore it turned its attention to the	concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world	of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed	as actual elements of external reality	3754.9996558176913
8049. in doing so science has unquestionably	cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous	and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular	superstitions	3469.416175635107
8050. there have been indeed many important and valuable gains	from the development of our present scientific view of the world	for which we may be rightly grateful	2855.9166245544575
8051. all this has not however	been an unmixed blessing	389.2580562903713
8052. the scientific debunking of the spirit world	has been in a way too successful and too thorough	1423.2089075731378
8053. the house has	been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means	or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience	of spirit	4824.454262213563
8054. although the particular form of conceptualization which	popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit	was undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which led to such	excesses remains with us as vividly as ever	3928.659990798009
8055. we simply find ourselves	in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure	and meaning of this range of our experience	3669.0334832824383
8056. there is no framework	or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and	no part	of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we	can refer this experience	3846.045904988917
8057. science has simply left us helpless and powerless	in this important sector of our lives	1636.9755375816442
8058. the situation in	which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur	miller's play the crucible which deals with the salem witch	trials	2728.869204895255
8059. as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community	of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century	3488.0668719850596
8060. aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides	the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community	2473.9891250093856
8061. the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting	the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns	which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any	age	4987.022636345267
8062. there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people	646.5252499196868
8063. instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective	of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things	enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take	the witches and devils which are under discussion	6722.194429386905
8064. a teenage girl abigail	williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle	the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods	in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with	these evil beings	4404.301281758815
8065. for all involved in this discussion the devil is	a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night	the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually	can be seen flying through the air	6596.4886529646365
8066. as the play unfolds however	the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil	which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community	2981.034442727252
8067. everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it	958.7393254176253
8068. it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail	and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through	the whole town until all have been infected by it	3334.9001905517907
8069. it grows terribly	and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery	moral disintegration and destruction	2813.755410701605
8070. the audience leaves the play	under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit	in its living active manifestation always evokes	2733.8854418458354
8071. if one asks	about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works	within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give	than spirit	4974.002486561823
8072. this is not to attempt to say what spirit is but	only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a	common experience	2737.478258627539
8073. we marvel at their	blindness for not seeing this	259.79523284598923
8074. yet are not we of the mid-twentieth	century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the	devil just as bad off as they- only in a different way	5185.7607092457565
8075. in our	disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are	unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in	this play	3458.8426877640404
8076. we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare	speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment	to that which has already been discredited and proved false	6182.399694459358
8077. even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score	259.31674939195943
8078. in	a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the	first act of the play he says at one point: however that experience	never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld	or the existence of lucifer's many-faced lieutenants	7222.754804862774
8079. and his	belief is not to his discredit	166.19865509103357
8080. better minds than hale's were-	and still are- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond	our ken	2579.511621246645
8081. on the other hand a little later on he says:	since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god's	beard and the devil's horns but the world is still gripped between	two diametrically opposed absolutes	3950.6140902367297
8082. the concept of unity in which	positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good	and evil are relative ever-changing and always joined to the same phenomenon-	such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences	and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas h	7602.803752161734
8083. when we see	the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's	worthlessness- until redeemed- the necessity of the devil may	become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time	again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church	or church-state	5170.941332482942
8084. apparently he does not intend	that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being	actually real	3253.7838688701954
8085. yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that	the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and	potency of that which came over salem	3218.471556422939
8086. it casts a spell upon them	so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence	of an evil power	3673.2418956540305
8087. it is not enough in accounting for this feeling	to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together	to produce a cumulative effect	2584.748403033216
8088. for this does not account for the	integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as	the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness	which comes over those who watch the play like a spell	6554.991777493224
8089. the	reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions	to the contrary	1403.8446833079947
8090. there is	nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and	universally felt than spirit	2345.15621428404
8091. apart from spirit there could be no community	for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any	community its unity cohesiveness and permanence	2833.0635258856855
8092. think for example	of the spirit of the marine corps	563.8111323729014
8093. surely this is a reality we	all acknowledge	166.8688658637125
8094. we cannot of course assign it any substance	248.21488922360413
8095. it	is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time	792.7458866066371
8096. yet	it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and	known	1415.6191664958842
8097. so it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the	spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street	corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux	klan	4246.495028402029
8098. every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit	is the center of its unity and identity	2836.616717164168
8099. in searching for clues	which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit	the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove	the most fruitful	3330.009769258122
8100. for it is primarily in community that we know and	experience spirit	956.5791323484864
8101. it is spirit which gives life to a community and	causes it to cohere	942.2371859196708
8102. it is the spirit which is the source of a community's	drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from	the world outside so that the community grows and prospers	5332.543243243326
8103. yet the	spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community	783.4925419621968
8104. the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable	ideas	1647.116885405132
8105. one characteristic of the spirit in community is	its givenness	374.65510222727397
8106. the members of the community do not create the spirit	but rather find it present and waiting for them	2582.6340809010576
8107. it is for them a given	which they and they alone possess	642.8551404211933
8108. the spirit of the marine corps	was present and operative before any of the present members of it came	into it	3039.284365449987
8109. it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it	so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future	recruits to find as they come into it	3643.365916682281
8110. if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be	understanded of the people- and this it must not be forgotten	is one of the goals of the perennial theological task- there is	no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of	representation	7502.308010439646
8111. this does not mean that mythological language as	such can no longer be used in theology and preaching	1566.8935774070146
8112. the absurd notion	that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological	concepts completely misrepresents bultmann's intention	1882.862665863213
8113. his point	is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded	as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing	the christian kerygma	3447.721647406243
8114. when we say that a mythological mode	of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned	as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding	of existence	5145.353349062962
8115. mythological concepts may by all means still be used	but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers	that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological	terms	3442.9336763289875
8116. the statement is often made	that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual	stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting	the christian faith	4963.7124708879355
8117. but this statement is completely unconvincing	44.032929673403615
8118. if bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered	to	the evidence is overwhelming that he does	not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of	traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant	5753.089706058029
8119. nor is	it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our	culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly	estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been	communicated	4030.5612541436326
8120. on the contrary even in the heart of the bible	belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there	the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under	way together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself	and his world	7219.136521432636
8121. in fact it is in just such a situation	that the profundity of bultmann's argument is disclosed	1411.707271433635
8122. although	the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do	not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity	with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence	5931.193167172396
8123. this is	especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle	class	939.7426478535402
8124. time and again in counseling and teaching one encounters	members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity	the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage	and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious	6572.026511698362
8125. the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture-protestantism	so often observed to characterize the preaching	and teaching of the american churches	2324.2173330151777
8126. in the absence of a truly adequate	conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable	need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at	hand- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of	folk religion current in the situation	7102.575431171089
8127. this is not to say that	the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent	peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely	cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized	gospel	3948.245275019735
8128. but it is to say that this need is far more important for such	infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected	3664.4486045106423
8129. however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly	as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements	of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference	to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace	4616.4784365641735
8130. to be	sure when this is pointed out a common response among certain churchmen	is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd	and to take solace from paul's castigation of the wisdom of	the wise in the opening chapter of first corinthians	6938.636678325174
8131. but can	we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation	639.1543580172228
8132. can the church	risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their	wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness	of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways	of talking about the same thing	6832.469861306368
8133. can we continue to alienate precisely	those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation	our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious	2870.3979232232223
8134. there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church	derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from	that god is completely independent of his creation and	so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world	6713.528404250923
8135. by analogy	the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the	world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be	the church	2991.9438884487263
8136. but as scripture everywhere reminds us god does	have need of his creatures and the church a fortiori can ill afford	to do without the talents with which the world by god's providence	presents it	5630.644012032857
8137. and yet this is exactly the risk we run when	we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel	in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured	men	4042.535169796623
8138. until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened	men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources	on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends	5322.242877173021
8139. in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted	that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved;	and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when	we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction	4295.998903157163
8140. but the main point	here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the	demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable	3894.592727226266
8141. this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without	condition	1090.158022193847
8142. if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise	say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then	my only choice is to refuse to be a christian	6083.980522433174
8143. expressed differently:	if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ	is some form of self-destruction whether of the body or of the mind-	sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus- then there is	no alternative but that the price remain unpaid	4294.300934006611
8144. this must be	stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding	chapter	1877.551111083838
8145. modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has	come of age; and though this process by no means represents	an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from	the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still	a positive step forward; and those of us who so richly benefit from	it should be the last to despise it	5819.440509680756
8146. in any event it is an irreversible	step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we	have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has	seen fit to place us	6337.765049543502
8147. to say this of course is to take up a	position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred	years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern	period in theological thought	4212.799433163779
8148. we have aligned ourselves with that	liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among	the great names in its history those of schleiermacher ritschl	herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and	the early barth and in part at least bultmann	6555.427974532419
8149. it is to this same	tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and	a half of american theology also belong	2457.6929451293463
8150. for we must number here not	only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention	those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of	the brothers niebuhr and tillich as	well	5462.008955884631
8151. finally we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously	neoliberal movement that developed at the university	of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work	of alfred north whitehead	3543.6816245828363
8152. what makes this long and diverse	tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it	have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively	modern world	5004.150623451294
8153. although they have also been concerned to stand squarely	within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited	no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity	3104.648740969207
8154. they have insisted rather on living fully and completely	within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god	have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him	5658.926466316488
8155. when we say then that today in our situation the demand for	demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply	saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring	achievement	3736.6454976404516
8156. however much we may have to criticize liberal theology's	constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive	to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it	4279.185170094038
8157. in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking	the deadlock into which bultmann's attempt to formulate such a	theology has led	2598.9535181699976
8158. for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives	to his position variously represented by the other participants	in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative	4836.6219450566105
8159. if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be	accepted	by theology unconditionally the position of the right is	clearly untenable	2327.44919333267
8160. whereas bultmann's center position is structurally	inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds	alone the general position of the right as represented say	by karl barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of	the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material	grounds we have just considered	7553.155367409093
8161. it follows then provided	the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative	is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented	on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least	is found in much that is significant in american and english theology	4895.228240607854
8162. in order to make the implications of our position as clear	as possible we may develop this argument at greater length	3032.67645885566
8163. we	may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other	than the three typically represented by bultmann barth and buri	2177.3183762537374
8164. to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms	of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more	than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless	question	6427.3494691829155
8165. thus if what is at issue is whether all s	is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p	or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question	is false	3863.4898838991494
8166. hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology	myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether	only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted;	for in either event the first possibility is excluded	6826.631678862048
8167. therefore	the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand	by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive	positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third	but really pseudo position of bultmann	4302.244318551042
8168. a second point requires more extended comment	141.61689369759705
8169. one hundred years ago there existed in england the association	for the promotion of the unity of christendom	2352.5186397799157
8170. representing	as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman	and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable	to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was	condemned by the holy office in 1864	4298.009116607127
8171. now again in 1961 in	england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly	discussed as christian unity	2810.152624898768
8172. the church unity octave january	18-25 was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various	churches	1411.6640217314714
8173. many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict	whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian	unity in 1961 than there was in 1861	4786.915948907417
8174. but it must be readily seen	that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these	hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side	3228.2646461206195
8175. for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly	universe has written	1890.7370093131917
8176. i came to england last summer to	do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman	1258.6312193358347
8177. as an	american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions	and expectations; being intellectually influenced by newman	and the general 19th-century literature of england i knew only a	protestant-dominated	country	5184.004051333257
8178. since arriving here however i have formed	a far different religious picture of present-day england	1088.314030523521
8179. in representing	part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my	own personal experiences reactions and judgments; but my primary aim	is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing	and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the	present religious	state of england	7430.282400191271
8180. since the protestant clergy for the	most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman	collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman	catholic cleric	3665.6055789405473
8181. in any case i have always been treated with the	utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where	anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest	4659.9585370886625
8182. nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism	167.70532772778841
8183. on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well	as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires	and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not	concerned with the historical significance of the day	6588.400045678207
8184. a birmingham	newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the	true story of guy fawkes which began:   when you	pile your	guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the	true story of guy fawkes you will remember	4536.05159283908
8185. in the 355 years since	the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten	so here is a reminder	3282.967941511167
8186. the article proceeded to give an inaccurate	account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1	1419.8689900601307
8187. in	spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the	conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's	the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very	small one which did not enjoy a gracious	hearing from the general public	7359.395840291453
8188. the return of the catholic hierarchy	in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact	was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty	2579.8504543122394
8189. in 1864 newman professedly	had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in	order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers	4278.446718676519
8190. now in 1961 the catholic population of england is still	quite small; yet it represents a very	considerable percentage of the churchgoing population	2313.105599558945
8191. a protestant	woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham	oratory church on sunday mornings	3248.16233125412
8192. she found	this a marvel because as she said only six per cent of english people	are churchgoers	1574.5043171765924
8193. she may not have been exact on this number but	others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than	ten	3472.2429927103876
8194. from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly	attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during	services	2178.01717007475
8195. a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of	a large city university following anglican evensong at which there	was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a	hundred	5313.1988644655985
8196. the protestants themselves are the first to admit the	great falling off in effective membership in their churches	1572.2320840764644
8197. according	to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england	the total of confirmed members is 9748000 but only 2887671	are registered on the parochial church rolls and over 27 million	people in england are baptized into the church of england but	roughly only a tenth of them continue	7727.851698498666
8198. an amazing article in the	manchester guardian of last november entitled fate of redundant	churches states than an archbishops' commission reported	last month that in the church of england alone there are 790	churches which are redundant now or will be in 20 years' time	4605.748833408473
8199. a further	260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948	560.9344495233606
8200. and	in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has	authorized	the demolition or more often the sale of 764 chapels	2195.498025700951
8201. most of	these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither anglicans	nor	nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics	and have done so	4096.301724032509
8202. while it must be said that these same	protestants have built some new churches during this period and that	religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason	for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are	going to church	4278.801380492276
8203. it should be admitted too that there is a good	percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics		1121.093690350751
8204. still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear	from the remarks of many people that protestants are decreasing and	catholics increasing	2330.0716730453337
8205. an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly	but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true	1633.9073968306093
8206. a century ago	newman saw that liberalism would	gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and	that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable	breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own	4036.6356094146586
8207. that day is perhaps today 1961 and it seems no longer very meaningful	to call england a protestant country	2579.188986365584
8208. one of the ironies	of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively	speaking many real christians to unite	2304.637547329761
8209. many english	catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are	in a new ascendancy	2118.729356820336
8210. the london universe devoted its centenary	issue	last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress	during the last one hundred years	2443.8835247990205
8211. with traditional nationalistic spirit	some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism	at its best	1657.0982570257372
8212. i have found myself saying with other foreigners here	that english catholics are good catholics	1092.7481119103727
8213. it has been my experience	to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone	in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses	at mass	4829.931118740942
8214. they hope of course to reclaim the non-catholic	population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction	they recite by heart the prayer for england:   o blessed	virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother	look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us	all who greatly hope and trust in thee h	5509.329612308271
8215. intercede for our separated	brethren that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the	chief shepherd the vicar of thy son h	4268.466237961918
8216. a hymn often to be	heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories	in england's ancient faith that endured persecution and which	proclaims: faith of our fathers: mary's prayersshall win	our country back to thee	4011.0742913062977
8217. the english saints are widely venerated	quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs	and cardinal newman will soon be canonized	3892.92634994046
8218. because they	have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have	always strongly resented the charge of being un-english	2026.1255283374499
8219. i	have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it	is still in the air	2584.8649835013775
8220. for example a writer in a recent number of the	queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the	only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion	that they are 'un-english'	3641.8843103392596
8221. in this connection it has been	observed that the increasing number of irish catholics priests and	laity in england while certainly seen as good for catholicism	is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic	english catholics especially when these irishmen offer to remind	their christian brethren of this good	7705.886511792116
8222. one of the	more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century	is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities	2460.8731953469464
8223. at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics	partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854	2813.5055441197296
8224. moreover	for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the	city to care for their religious needs	1718.0594607084852
8225. now not only are there considerably	more laity as students and professors at oxford but there	are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable	and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university	5815.895708105211
8226. some catholic priests lecture there; catholic seminarians attend	tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students	1423.4232437630203
8227. further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable	position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it	in the mass media of england	4267.197077425815
8228. the general tone of articles appearing	in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the	sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic	church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant	churches	4142.874069343415
8229. on successive sundays during october 1960 paul ferris	wrote articles in the observer depicting	clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist	church	4474.332094628438
8230. the catholic priest though somewhat superficially	drawn easily came out the best	641.9177256582511
8231. there were many letters of strong	protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed	portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters	and without really very much to do as clergyman	5783.059370758192
8232. such a series of	articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian	england	1257.2699083282246
8233. there was so much interest shown in this present-day	venture that it was continued on bbc where comments were	equally made by an anglican parson a free church minister and a catholic	priest	5324.401112332707
8234. catholic priests have frequently appeared on	television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal	footing with protestant clergymen	1877.331995042597
8235. a notable example of this was	the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool	dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr	ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury	5148.650147394075
8236. the good	feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now	well known in england	1415.4524806927298
8237. the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary	has been televised several times in recent months	1868.867962470922
8238. and it was	interesting to observe that bbc's television film on christmas	eve was the bells of st mary's	1723.648313749972
8239. of course	the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern	of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr	fisher then anglican archbishop of canterbury to the vatican	last december	5478.273274194153
8240. it was the first time an english primate has done	this since the 14th century	1103.7045193654535
8241. english catholics reacted to this event	with moderate but real hope	751.4488415190699
8242. the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal	959.6295750289688
8243. the straight	line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality	502.2865001685909
8244. but	how can one figure symbolize both	141.65595541610895
8245. christianity declares that	in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal	concur	1416.273327053348
8246. perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique	and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as irenaeus	3276.544943654603
8247. to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical	individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic	aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself	with man's history	4388.352617163966
8248. yet this utterly individual historical person	must also contain within himself the common history of mankind	1879.3283177990809
8249. his	history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in	it	1092.7492487805955
8250. his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the	crucifixion of jesus	2352.174937476605
8251. each man can identify himself with the history	and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified	himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a	new humanity	3658.5371400761605
8252. not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral	represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has	motion as well as recurrence	4666.177987062306
8253. as represented by a spiral history may	in some sense be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event	remains unique	2030.0335823527107
8254. christ is both unique and universal	64.96625631648998
8255. the first	turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam	935.3164947510406
8256. as	origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning	so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of	christ	4457.000227391275
8257. whence then comes the substance of the first man	260.30267894384207
8258. from	god's will and wisdom and from virgin earth	396.5580697676347
8259. for 'god had	not rained' says the scripture before man was made 'and there	was no man to till the earth'	2026.2260408543395
8260. from this earth then while it was	still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity	2813.203433760414
8261. irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private	individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity	2309.7469404340673
8262. adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed	perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development	toward perfection	3878.0630688374695
8263. they were in fact children	14.831242381725946
8264. irenaeus does not	claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for	him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the	fall	4478.3696438393035
8265. existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence	of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity	into history	2616.283366312227
8266. historical existence is a created good	65.41243395756398
8267. the biblical	symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: so	god created man in his own image; in the similitude of god he created	him	2873.088851284137
8268. thus the image of god is that which makes	a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of god by contrast	is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature	4138.026409939989
8269. recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that	he does not consistently maintain this distinction	1871.4873413549935
8270. he does not mean	to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through	the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly	mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality	4114.324006237393
8271. and he laid down for him certain	conditions: so that if he kept the command of god then he would	always remain as he was that is immortal; but if he did not he	would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken	4697.367030518825
8272. these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal;	yet he did not stop being human as a result	3037.8114838974734
8273. there is no justification	for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image	of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the	later theological distinction between the image of god and	the similitude of god	4135.931844740767
8274. man was created with the	capacity for immortality but the devil's promise of immortality	in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality	3265.715723052158
8275. he was in the	words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality	1097.018797261335
8276. the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man	did not believe this	1396.7236747426664
8277. eve was disobedient; for she did	not obey when as yet she was a virgin	1094.7806731957203
8278. and even as she having indeed	a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin h having	become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and	to the entire human race; so also did mary having a man betrothed	to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become	the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race	8683.437312387765
8279. because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere	potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created	as children irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience	as being due no doubt to carelessness but still wicked	4458.630101106346
8280. his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts	him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin	mary	3930.089731544305
8281. that parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too;	for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man	so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought	death into the world and all our woe	4613.378115339624
8282. with this act of disobedience	and not with the inception of his individual existence man	began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from	the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality	5629.881658134024
8283. at	the nadir of that circuit is death	165.9452211709553
8284. along with the fruit they did	also fall under the power of death because they did eat in disobedience;	and disobedience to god entails death	3867.8601605462777
8285. wherefore as they became	forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it	1248.2066275673983
8286. this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam	and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday	as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday; he sees	a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath	7347.0275758338075
8287. in	any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of	the tree they obtained mortality instead	1731.065920787696
8288. the wages of sin is death	65.55327290654336
8289. man's life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with	god must now be conformed to the shape of death	1879.511453753577
8290. nevertheless	even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs	to god and he still rules	2584.3093045258547
8291. even death therefore has a providential	as well as a punitive function	646.9701221308701
8292. wherefore also he god	drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree	of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture	to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that	he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded	him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable	8626.416021188483
8293. but	he set a bound to his state of sin by interposing death and thus	causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the	flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at	length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god	5253.239556699755
8294. this	idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well	into the scheme of irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for	the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ	5922.284768884495
8295. as man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that	christ could bring many to life	2035.9860154657067
8296. it is probably fair to say	that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of	sin is	3250.64845258959
8297. this applies to his picture of adam	92.94119820972291
8298. it is borne out also	by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation	to the next	3266.385332390912
8299. it becomes most evident in his description of	christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but	whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality	3092.0512846989905
8300. this emphasis	upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem irenaeus	shares with many early theologians especially the greek-speaking ones	3050.840813845234
8301. they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility	which can mean deliverance from	time and history	1884.8351142019687
8302. death reminds man of his sin but it reminds	him also of his transience	1404.9924248724265
8303. it represents a punishment that he knows	he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives	his life within the process of time	2592.766421608757
8304. these two aspects of death cannot	be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified	2115.893384437549
8305. the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as	altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of	death cannot be separated	2723.0932401343816
8306. such efforts almost always find themselves	compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and	then older and then still older in short whether adam's life was	intended to be part of the process of time	6157.723569038874
8307. if it was then it must	have been god's intention to translate him at a certain point from	time to eternity	2030.6455513362675
8308. one night so some of these theories run adam would	have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve;	and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal	5662.405279088988
8309. the	embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an	illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for	some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the	natural order of time and change	4387.218468832551
8310. on the other hand christian	faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal	existence	2342.434486709625
8311. it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law	642.6055239617438
8312. if	this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea	of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that	temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state	into which man is put by the will of the creator	7019.878650858716
8313. this seems to have	been the conclusion to which origen was forced	637.5594784658097
8314. if death receives	more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives	less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ	begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal	ie created existence	6674.330160908643
8315. such an interpretation of death radically	alters the christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation	from not salvation in time and history	2313.044805200329
8316. because christianity	teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of	christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision	of the christian understanding of the work of christ	5480.087611380089
8317. furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly	is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right	to refuse to accept persons it dislikes	2849.40539938456
8318. the unitarian clergy were	an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood	in the back bay- and parker was definitely not a gentleman	either in theology or in manners	5338.811081838109
8319. ezra stiles gannett an honorable	representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the	issue in 1845 insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated	and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force	could exist	4214.3139906849465
8320. even so gannett judiciously argued the association could	legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor	assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard	to their correctness	5318.892844314164
8321. we today are not entitled to excoriate	honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who	barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their	congregations	3315.2529397799517
8322. one can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-	that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture	to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker	use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should	come to occupy it	7453.617621702171
8323. finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen	as gannett's son explained in the biography of his father	they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title	of christians	3752.244234045941
8324. their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for	intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry	to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a natural religion	4287.204202631038
8325. grant all this- still when modern unitarianism and	the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults	parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker	received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience	4129.451161842225
8326. had it done so the blot	on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard	divinity school assemble today to honor parker's insurgence other	than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi	3955.738964662215
8327. happily for posterity then the boston association did	not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close	for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality	4993.46006081579
8328. fortunately	the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol	defended parker's sincerity as did also gannett and chandler	robbins; whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and	rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship	4295.995298983208
8329. in the	hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the	hand	and requested parker to visit him- whereupon our burly theodore	again burst into tears	4275.376739192858
8330. all this near tragedy which to us borders	on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always	warming ourselves with a glow of complacency	2970.7663503173244
8331. it was indeed a near	thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england	did triumph	1872.420017062784
8332. to the extent	that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying	he asked for it	1720.8924331760652
8333. yet even after all these stratagems the conscience	of christian liberality is still not laid to rest any more than is	the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance	for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson's the divinity school	address of naming its hall of philosophy after him	7498.786231457317
8334. in both cases	the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant	apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought	to the test it behaved shabbily	3102.1082935565114
8335. suppose they both had ventured into	realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen	settle frank differences of opinion	3277.513101909979
8336. is it after all possible	that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity	they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any	conservative has ever to worry about	3748.08387037395
8337. however there is a crucial	difference between the two histories	563.701435295203
8338. emerson evaded the problem	by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked	out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his	departure preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious	veneration	4296.63346381136
8339. parker insisted upon not resigning even when the majority	wanted him to depart upon daring the fellowship to throw him	out	3047.565644235771
8340. hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards	a canker within the liberal sensitivity	1739.0939769529257
8341. he still points an accusing	finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support	him nor the energy to cut his throat	4291.3794596332655
8342. actually the dispute	between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and	social was a real one a bitter one	2191.3167624043954
8343. it cannot be smoothed over by	now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or	by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections	to him	4821.717372801128
8344. the fact is incontestable: that liberal world of unitarian	boston was narrow-minded intellectually sterile smug afraid	of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm	and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle	foundations were threatened	4302.4195025862555
8345. parker along with garrison and	charles sumner showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs	mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery	3703.8435255885124
8346. nevertheless	we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace;	their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists	is clear-cut	2868.840679765907
8347. but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within	the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository	of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by	holding him up as the champion of freedom	6206.14758663137
8348. even though his theological	theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation	he phrased is very much with us	1875.0720430690722
8349. it has been endlessly rephrased	but i may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves	obliged to become intolerant	3687.579532173074
8350. and then as they become aware	that they have reached the end of their patience what do they to	their dismay learn for the first time about themselves	2971.6011837009505
8351. there	can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel	in enforcing its canons of behavior	2809.8795828658454
8352. the gentle channing revered	by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville	that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant	spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and	action: no city in the world is governed so little by a police	and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment	5696.586404481537
8353. we stand more in awe of one another than most people	747.197211748309
8354. opinion is	less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod	of iron	1418.500916826598
8355. even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius	channing added- remember this is channing not parker!-	that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart should	he speak without book and consequently break some law of speech	or be hurried into some daring hyperbole he should find little mercy	7708.407676015386
8356. channing wrote this- in a letter! i think it fair to	say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons	2168.595540804322
8357. but theodore	parker commencing his mission to the world-at-large disguised	as the minister of a twenty-eighth congregational church which	bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the	founders made explicit	from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish	society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel	difference about clerical decorum	8189.493477004304
8358. because he spoke openly with what	channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- parker	vindicated channing's further prophecy that he who committed	this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals	were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines	4590.696087417304
8359. an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an	institution and only within those defined limits a license	1893.4809583966362
8360. by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should	i am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the	battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest	3753.789330913899
8361. he	arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had	to respond with at the least resentment	2798.7933486249676
8362. what otherwise could the	lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when	told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three	archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually	cried 'holy holy holy is the almighty	dollar'	4761.9905222277475
8363. nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan	stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be	astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of	rage as parker snarled at them thus: talk about the catholics	voting as the bishop tells! reproach the catholics for it! you	and i do the same thing	8629.515476064344
8364. there are a great many bishops who have never	had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not	to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar	a pope much nearer home	4380.240217174929
8365. boston has been controlled by a few capitalists	lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and	the preachers what to think	3873.953050847267
8366. parker meant business	0.20041515
8367. and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended	them: even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria	and are worse than those who deceived them- which implied that they	were very bad indeed	6053.522822784
8368. it was duty he said that his parents	had given him as a rule- beyond even the love that suffused his	being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied- and	it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted	him by the age of fifty	5228.916425842008
8369. parker could weep- and he wept astonishingly	often and on the slightest provocation- but the psychology of	those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to	massacre his opponents	4833.870149080507
8370. if it gave me pleasure to say hard things	he wrote i would shut up forever	1252.0159219114996
8371. we have to tell ourselves	that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because	he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter	tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than	fire	6529.148812076389
8372. because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself	up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england	he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's	consciences	3761.012030733685
8373. our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how	strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very	issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its	christian survival that of the literal factual historicity of the	miracles as reported in the four gospels	7801.667044016605
8374. it is idle to ask why we	are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety	decides anew	that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the	water into wine at eleven a m on the third of august a	d 32	4695.447091895829
8375. we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed	750.3082454297313
8376. so we are	the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right	side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass	on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode	3955.5992475467406
8377. we have not	the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working	in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard	divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most	formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying	that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked	miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine	8812.983459623963
8378. i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty	into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about	which i have not a shadow of doubt	3554.5311970719113
8379. it has been my lot all through	life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with	them the deepest and most vital of all questions the nature of the	hope of a life beyond this	6049.30513815913
8380. i have also constantly engaged in scientific	work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science	as well as in the religions in the world	3106.1529195186527
8381. in an amateurish yet in	a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology	astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation	of the advances being made in these fields	5358.624896690724
8382. doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while	and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the	bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have	been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:	attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bible-loving	generation and a critical doubting bible-emancipated race	8496.50136214634
8383. although	still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i	stood outside shivering in the cold	2034.1550754911812
8384. in one thing the higher	critics like the modernists however overreached themselves in claiming	that the gospel of john was not written in john's time but	well after the first century perhaps as late as 150 ad	5919.010345038986
8385. now	if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking	through his servant it is john's gospel	2176.2271285985926
8386. to ask me to believe	that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the	events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the	spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any	of those recorded in the bible	7329.853531793781
8387. here i took my leave of my learned	friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern	name of pragmatism or the thing that works	3220.72816775487
8388. test it try it and	if it works accept it as a guiding principle	1418.8471166104596
8389. so i put my	bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and	then tested it to see how it worked	2581.13566575196
8390. as a short possibly not the best	method i looked up word in the concordance and noted that	the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god's personal	message to man	5488.0071241482665
8391. the next traditional step then was to accept it	as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would	accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to	its conditions according to christ's invitation and promise that	if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether	it be of god or whether i speak of myself	5770.533047329844
8392. the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance	of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly	different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of	our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man	by the virgin mary the saviour of the world	8377.239085606048
8393. nor can any man save himself by good works or	by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural	fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally	expressing itself through such avenues	5939.103941296867
8394. i now ever look for	christ acording to his promises and those of the old testament as	well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness	over the whole earth	3943.9929105688448
8395. to state fully what the bible	means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to	formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and	friends	5026.8480253070065
8396. the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as	bread is food for the body	1586.0168165356997
8397. again as faith reveals god my father	and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me	daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer	4652.588070455802
8398. i place his	precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability dismissing	cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed	to him	2713.950955031154
8399. i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ	who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him	even though called to stand alone before the world	5634.9655955208245
8400. our lord's	invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see	789.1384573095287
8401. i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld	a very sick man in terrible pain	2605.808439659359
8402. as i ministered to his needs	i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i	learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and	nurse but also the lord	4110.25288254514
8403. in his heart he had that peace of which	the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace	i give unto you: not as the world giveth give i unto you	5659.795638075525
8404. let	not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid	500.41501720560734
8405. what	a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by	the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very	dear to him	4963.339694691805
8406. he was about to leave them to depart from this world	and return to his father in heaven	1568.2868524188418
8407. before he left them he promised	that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts	and minds	2815.2470290802958
8408. i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who	has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ	2021.5121001075065
8409. it makes	my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord's guidance	while ministering to the physical needs of my patients	4076.3303836199316
8410. how	often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking	for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents	not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and	his creatures	4486.272778791335
8411. looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote	these blessed words almost three thousand years ago: thou wilt	keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee: because	he trusteth in thee	5348.6685692652
8412. are you longing for peace in your heart	165.72219836342035
8413. such a calm and assuring peace can be yours	392.5831687185544
8414. as only a member	of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise	one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits	that are promised to those who are his own	4209.121764626533
8415. perhaps you are	not his child	64.77684769409115
8416. perhaps you do not know if you belong to him	376.89425230968726
8417. you	may know that you are in god's family and be just as sure of it as	you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father	4657.5546476610125
8418. god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that	whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life	and as many as received him to them gave he power to become	the sons of god even to them that believe on his name	4905.90974190065
8419. it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that	he gives his peace; not that empty peace the world offers but a deep	abiding peace which nothing can destroy	5495.564455201534
8420. why not open your	heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your saviour	and	let him fill you with peace that only he can give	3000.8831977292098
8421. then	with the hymn writer of old you can say:   i am resting today	in his wonderful peace   resting sweetly in jesus' control	3476.4978964031448
8422. i am kept from all danger by night and by day   and	his glory is flooding my soul	1581.9419458886252
8423. satellites sputniks rockets	balloons; what next	64.76525633359947
8424. our necks are stiff from gazing at	the wonders of outer space which have captured the imagination of the	american public	2038.4177961947858
8425. cape canaveral's achievements thunder forth from	the radio television and newspaper	760.3008516997941
8426. while we are filling	outer space with scientific successes for many the inner space	of their soul is an aching void	2045.326996936857
8427. proof	0.30041514999999996
8428. an average of 50 suicides	are reported in america each day! one out of every three or	four marriages end in divorce! over $200000000 is paid yearly to	the 80000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful	mankind who want to know what the future holds! delinquency	juvenile and adult is at an all-time high! further proof	5428.462078539087
8429. read	your daily newspaper!   unfortunately in our rush to beat	the russians we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ:	what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world	that includes outer space and lose his own soul	6709.267813196473
8430. or what	shall a man give in exchange for his soul	503.4346648679369
8431. 	0.30041514999999996
8432. gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business	according to god's standards	949.4896007900263
8433. it is true that we must	keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments; only	a fool would think otherwise	2829.144505745532
8434. but we must not forget man's soul	94.19066641184216
8435. is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news	that god put his son	jesus christ on earth to live and die to	save our hell-bound souls	5012.420180081329
8436. for god so loved the world that	he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should	not perish but have everlasting life	2604.1689101125985
8437. never	forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link	1183.7918111701113
8438. your spiritual	inner space helps determine the spirituality of america	as a nation	795.4994189110989
8439. we trust you are not one of the 70000000 americans	who do not attend church but who feel that various forms of recreation	are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great	5636.4335655090545
8440. is forgiveness of past sins assurance of present help and	hope of future bliss in your orbit	1409.94109364196
8441. or are you trying the devil's	substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within	1653.466083306695
8442. pleasure	fame and fortune drowning your troubles with a drink and living	it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry:	they may ease your hunger temporarily but they'll never take the	place of a satisfying mouth-watering steak	4298.603348028987
8443. no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will	relieve the gnawing of your inner space	2368.7692360872607
8444. why	0.20041515
8445. because your	soul was made to be filled with god himself not religious functions	about him	1882.6697332983101
8446. only he can satisfy the deepest longings	94.42124405314426
8447. that	is why the bible commands you to taste and see that the lord	is good: blessed happy is the man that trusteth in him		2715.9393819551947
8448. you can receive god into your heart and life	by a step of personal faith	1098.2622371216492
8449. accept the sinless son of god jesus	christ as your own personal saviour	1184.4311518159905
8450. as many as received him	jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even	to them that believe on his name	the lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear	3963.9125310852132
8451. the lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall i be	afraid	1411.7648754576576
8452. psalm 27:1   a certain teacher scheduled a fear party	for her fourth grade pupils	946.3442944658354
8453. it was a session at which all the youngsters	were told to express their fears to get them out in the open	where they could talk about them freely	4617.59273900993
8454. the teacher thought it was	so successful that she asks: wouldn't it be helpful to all age	groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their	fears and worries	3330.2170682373458
8455. dr george w crane a medical	columnist thinks it would	561.0014371524968
8456. he says: that would reduce neurotic	ailments tremendously	169.5002439587694
8457. each week an estimated 20 million patients call	upon us doctors	749.5372017706336
8458. of this number 50% or 10 million patients have	no diagnosable physical ailments whatever	949.7551567309298
8459. yet they keep running from one physician to another largely to get	a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles	3466.753175868004
8460. one of	the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus	be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions	2757.230121216983
8461. we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to	deal with the problem of fear these days	2585.570620058338
8462. it must be getting more serious	43.418289399510215
8463. people are giving their doctors a hard time	250.22170942539205
8464. only 8% of the worries had behind	them real causes which demanded attention	1180.2383689047967
8465. well most of our	fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something	else to worry about: why then do we have these fears	2986.177362471787
8466. what	is the real cause of them	139.7059177225027
8467. what is there about us that makes us so	anxious	374.4006444935183
8468. look at the things we do to escape our fears and	to forget our worries	1644.0352700838616
8469. we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune	tellers and soothsayers	641.6200237844217
8470. we spend billions of dollars at the race	tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling	2108.546244384469
8471. we spend billions	of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of	escapist entertainment	1407.3891947977656
8472. we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers	and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions	that are tearing us apart	3895.134318030071
8473. a visitor from a more peaceful	country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after	he had seen it all he said to a friend: you must be a very	sad people	3961.3524892226533
8474. sad was not the right word of course	251.318266524595
8475. he should	have said jittery for that's what we are	373.4473697724615
8476. and that's worse	than sad	22.210389632496085
8477. watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges	and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means	an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed	to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give	men a few hours of dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell	that many of them are running away from something	5654.969313292646
8478. in one of	his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign	of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates	4265.368999510991
8479. yes	and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing	503.4532888063644
8480. does that	explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business	1886.311290102156
8481. we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons	dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate	2172.513154146378
8482. i doubt that	fear parties and group confessionals will help very much	969.066133899512
8483. suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then	638.0354688169084
8484. isn't that	where most of them are already- right out on the front page of our	newspapers	2107.1243264546747
8485. maybe we are talking about them too much	166.84009807424505
8486. the question	is: what are we going to do about them	751.4703108897473
8487. meanwhile the	enemy will capitalize on our fears if he can	506.94637760708963
8488. hitler did just that	23 years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then	to a world war	3265.6019032574363
8489. the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand	and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate	for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate	3847.2811365084463
8490. it is	said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals	to attack	1877.664126023333
8491. it could have the same effect on communists	166.40828523529385
8492. the president	of the united states has said: we will never negotiate out	of fear and we will never fear to negotiate	3257.4438497620495
8493. that is a sound position	but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely	as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not	afraid	3664.3541376164058
8494. and that's another reason why it is imperative for us these	days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace	3466.153516087708
8495. turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do	that	1097.4504221240456
8496. in psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful words which you must	have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you	or to drive them out if they have you in their grip: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear	7355.170588873198
8497. the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid	941.8268994742035
8498. well	you say those are beautiful words all right but it was easy for the	psalmist to sing them in his day	3259.369611104711
8499. he didn't live in a world of perpetual	peril like ours	501.91155205580696
8500. he didn't know anything about the problems	we face today	563.6601523345455
8501. no	0.20041515
8502. read the next two verses: when the	wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh	they stumbled and fell	4087.770203826294
8503. though an host should encamp against me my	heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me in this will	i be confident	2451.900032432237
8504. that is almost a perfect description of	the predicament in which we find ourselves today isn't it	2109.0400566585204
8505. our	enemy is also threatening to devour us	166.6796319847137
8506. he has already devoured huge	areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains	and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing	not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they	try to escape their prison	6867.2866429643445
8507. yes indeed we too can see a warlike	host of infidels encamped against us	937.7892949216005
8508. what a terrible thing that	wailing wall in berlin! a man with a baby in his arms stood	there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest	of the family	5607.978797262471
8509. another man tried to swim across the river from the east	to the west but was shot and killed	1730.3062282577278

8511. the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation	most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there	anymore	2742.1512795519056
8512. practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends	that live in the opposite part of the city	2118.1759120048855
8513. people stand at the wall	giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists	pleading for loved ones	1870.5018276829815
8514. but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers	that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible	profanity	2586.021586479777
8515. there is only one escape left a tragic one and too	many people are taking it: suicide	1423.551266131893
8516. the normal rate of suicides in	east berlin was one a day but since the border was closed on august	13 it has jumped to 25 a day!   these things may be happening	many miles away from us but really they are right next door	6918.263163958754
8517. we are	all involved in them deeply involved	167.49923197573918
8518. and nobody knows what comes next	64.91894306030437
8519. we live from crisis to crisis	43.63142522047737
8520. and there is only one way for a	man to conquer his fears in such a world	2126.57047021773
8521. he must learn to say with	true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear	2993.723935343276
8522. the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid	1411.7648754576576
8523. notice	that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret	of his faith	1414.2383101950393
8524. first the lord is my light	65.701105800509
8525. he lived in a	very dark world but he was not in the dark	946.2259831341364
8526. the same god who called	this world into being when he said: let there be light!-	those were his very first creative words- he began the world with	light- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged	into darkness	6705.056764055784
8527. the	psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only	anticipate the coming of christ	2602.4071424024974
8528. he lived in the dawn; he could	only see the light coming over the horizon	1112.8711583126894
8529. we live in the bright daylight	of that great event; for us it is a fact in history	2350.1073597507575
8530. why should	we not have the same faith and an even greater experience of the light	which it gives	1729.9544296799916
8531. this is the faith that moved the psalmist	to add his second conception of god: the lord is h my salvation	3047.7769434623183
8532. he knew that his god would save him from his enemies	because he had saved him from his sins	1737.9865870310507
8533. if god could do that he could	do anything	394.74895516195033
8534. the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his	flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul	2323.4332603596004
8535. and god had conquered that one by his grace! so why worry about	all the others	1881.5121682508168
8536. the apostle paul said the same thing in the	language and faith of the new testament: he that spared not	his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with	him freely give us all things	4274.348792737982
8537. h if god be for us who can be	against us	745.3973828112128
8538. h who shall separate us from the love of christ	377.1191776125038
8539. shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness	or peril or sword	1430.0920024255088
8540. salvation!	this is the key to	the conquest of fear	375.2538794197625
8541. this gets down to the heart of our problem for	it reconciles us with god whom we fear most of all because we have	sinned against him	4268.187197795004
8542. and so the psalmist	gives us one more picture of god: the lord is the strength	of my life	2604.509007681332
8543. the word is really stronghold	14.774162101581151
8544. it recalls those	words of another psalm: god is our refuge and strength a very	present help in trouble	2600.745926374141
8545. therefore will not we fear though the earth	be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the	sea h come behold the works of the lord what desolations he	hath made in the earth	4061.484853186067
8546. but again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until	the close of the ninth century ad when an arabic scholar tabit	ibn korra is said to have discussed the magic square of	three	5910.515403351554
8547. thus while it remains possible that the babylonians andor	the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before	the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from	the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her	claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years	5431.187024147637
8548. the	concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a	forceful ruler which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of	the	warring states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese	empire under the ch'in dynasty	6710.720055351419
8549. but this	was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian	despotism	789.7424056892625
8550. among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor	shih huang-ti in his efforts to insure the continuation of	this hard-won national unity was the burning of the books in 213 bc	with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for	divergent thinking; but as he had a special fondness for magic and	divination he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared	8615.25863945853
8551. many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning	of the vast ch'in palace some ten years later; yet some must have	survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination	and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting	china and keeping it together for a longer period		4369.3350397888435
8552. in fact during	the first century bc an extensive literature sprang up devoted	to these subjects finding its typical expression in the so-called	wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to	the lo shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection	with divination	6918.153280644229
8553. however the wei books were also destroyed	in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final	proscription in 605	2162.0002774986883
8554. after all this destruction of old literature	it should be obvious why we have so little information about the	early history and development of the lo shu which was already	semisecret anyhow	5135.561510815543
8555. but in spite of all this enough evidence remains	to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object	of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching fullest	expression in the han period	4119.043273774471
8556. although modern scholars have	expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere	mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence	on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries	they could have found most of the answers right within the square	itself	7448.5971164218845
8557. but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent	mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers-	singly or in combination- and then tried to consider these in	the light of old chinese cosmological concepts	4140.907930759797
8558. such an analysis	speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu 5	was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints	that they had a knowledge of this diagram	5468.98444915232
8559. the importance of this	5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of	the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the	numbers- quite apart from any numerological considerations which is	to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it	4683.8688323021015
8560. indeed mathematically	speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most	important number in the entire diagram	2109.107084261294
8561. if one takes the middle	number 5 and multiplies it by 3	the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of	all the rows columns and two main diagonals	3337.9432080429447
8562. then if the middle number	is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through	multiplying it by the highest number 9	the result is 45; and the latter is the total sum	of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are	overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed	8236.684661663736
8563. furthermore	the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical	mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of	its central position; it is also their mathematical mean since it	is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal 10	5011.971419073993
8564. in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium	would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese	3703.1848026864
8565. for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female	equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature;	and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and	small odd numbers and those composed of large and small even	numbers were all equal to each other	5311.18226538206
8566. thus all differences were	leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and	the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively	symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis	5945.9859310351385
8567. the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square-	for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that this number so	neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain	why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 and	why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality	5416.982026227584
8568. these twin	tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty	1183.1655735089703
8569. the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further	stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when	the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow-	which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions-	and took 5 as the dynastic number believing that he would thus	place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious	influences	5822.027140888631
8570. his immediate motive for doing this may not have	been directly inspired by the lo shu but this measure must inevitably	have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy	4819.070923576245
8571. after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well	as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping one's	self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest	3469.540663304576
8572. later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too	literally	1408.8685735186123
8573. all this emphasis on centrality and on the number	5 as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun	as far back as 400 bc also may conceivably have led to the development	of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to	fit everything into numerical categories of five	5076.749030303409
8574. we find for example	such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains	the five directions the five metals five	colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five	bodily functions five viscera and many others	6104.300269460983
8575. this trend has	often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though	they had served as the base for all the rest; but why did the old	chinese postulate five elements when the ancient near east-	which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence	in human life and activities- recognized only four	5461.599742083634
8576. and why	did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions	when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only	the usual four	4500.017181325771
8577. obviously something suddenly caused them to start	thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of	the lo shu	2316.3902306498803
8578. this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect	on chinese thinking	564.2404163600211
8579. whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu	diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties-	and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on	some mathematical bases- the urgent desire to place everything into	categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until	an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought	5553.143296624165
8580. scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature	or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that	seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and	philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought	in china for many centuries	7326.958112327598
8581. square	although the primary mathematical properties of the middle	number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation	of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep	fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers	this was actually only a beginning of wonders	5199.752199326717
8582. for the lo	shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief	religious and philosophical ideas of its time	3269.5777315080813
8583. as such one cannot	fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without	knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu; but conversely	one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something	about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they	saw expressed in it	5084.233117181706
8584. the chinese world view during the han dynasty	when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its	popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang	and five-elements school which was traditionally founded by tsou	yen	6653.068287646219
8585. according to this doctrine the universe was ruled by heaven	t'ien- as a natural force or in the personification of a supreme	sky-god- governing all things by means of a process called the	tao	which can be roughly interpreted as the order of the universe	or the universal way	4910.086851603401
8586. heaven acting through the tao	expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles	the yin and the yang	3060.8126765175575
8587. the yang or male principle was the source	of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun; while	the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet	inactivity and was associated with the moon	3953.225819091132
8588. together these two	principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were	present in everything	1861.9544700638708
8589. we have already seen that odd numbers	were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so	that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two	principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center	4138.998988099007
8590. during	the han dynasty another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo	shu considering the latter as a plan of ancient china	3280.026374905227
8591. instead	of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine	provinces as was usually	done this equated the odd yang numbers	with mountains and the even numbers	with rivers; taking the former	from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from	the principal river systems of old china	5264.996832515156
8592. thus the middle	number 5 represented sung-shan in honan central china; the	3 t'ai-shan in shantung east china; the 7 hwa-shan in shensi	west china; the 1 heng-shan in hopei north china	; and the	9 huo-shan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain	5557.5047046041045
8593. for the rivers the 4 represented the huai to the southeast;	the 2 the san kiang southwest;	the 8 the chi in the northeast; and the 6 the yellow river	in the northwest	3581.5471382231312
8594. note that by western standards this	plan was upside down as it put north at the bottom and south	at the top with the other directions correspondingly altered; but in	this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention	for all maps	6691.262863668347
8595. the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was	equated with the nine provinces; and whenever the lo shu	involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion	3222.6463570037586
8596. few persons who join the church are insincere	250.87980859478557
8597. they earnestly desire	to do the will of god	262.54085071759465
8598. when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve	christian stature it is an indictment of the church	2602.290671307333
8599. these	fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure	to follow through	786.633726723772
8600. a program of lay visitation evangelism can	end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless	practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active	fellowship	5315.478148501937
8601. the work of lay visitation evangelism is not	completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have	been interviewed	2028.2144225567845
8602. in the average situation about one-third of those visited	make commitments to christ and the church	1878.5768843396957
8603. the pastor and the	membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow	through immediately with a carefully planned program	1574.4574493540097
8604. the first thirty	to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine	their interest and participation in the life of the church	3485.1488687893534
8605. neglect	means spiritual paralysis or death	43.76642052038711
8606. churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation	and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members	loyal and active	4092.046631776067
8607. this is the answer to the problem of membership	delinquency	371.2182023032363
8608. it is important that persons desiring to	unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it	may be meaningful and spiritually significant	3861.607691574359
8609. it is unfair and unchristian	to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership	before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications	2740.348476930343
8610. preparation for church membership begins immediately after	_ the pastor writes a personal letter	to each individual expressing his joy over the decision assuring	him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time and outlining	the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday	6947.422855170084
8611. some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported	by the visitors	1107.017267011422
8612. it should not be postponed later than the next day	560.850372843405
8613. _ the pastor	calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance	conference	1413.6522289871523
8614. if possible he should make an appointment in order	that all persons involved may be present	1877.2357234531241
8615. this is not a social	call	43.60662625977899
8616. it is definitely a spiritual guidance conference	141.32523959840415
8617. he	will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity	of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the	membership preparation sessions	2472.333251049561
8618. there may be problems of conduct or	questions of belief which will require his counsel	1642.397039401311
8619. each conference	should be concluded naturally with prayer	167.50948257084718
8620. a piece of devotional material	_	a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary	for adults	2589.708191379882
8621. none should ask less	2.932249205284223
8622. those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the	meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred	vows	3688.500117105565
8623. they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper	devotion to it if membership requires something of them	2033.2453094537573
8624. many	churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time	for adult preparation classes	2121.409637205685
8625. others meet on sunday night at the	mid-week service or for a series of four nights	1258.5436378238114
8626. some pastors have	two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between	1185.2474837015418
8627. the sessions should cover four major areas: - the christian	faith - duties of church	membership - the local church and its program	following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing	with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the	week	2323.321719470865
8628. this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership	packet	957.2315179829575
8629. most pastors find	that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore	hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday	2604.1190919601913
8630. in this session	the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the	work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the	local church	4313.299151018704

8633. an interest finder or	talent sheet may be filled out by each person	786.0796360922791
8634. the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the	church facilities and refreshments	1651.423635445931
8635. the social time gives an opportunity	for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members	1258.4830869073676
8636. suggestions for membership preparation	in conducting	the membership preparation-inquirers' class the pastor should	plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest	on the part of the class	5018.1201626575985

8642. some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly	392.9747450326606
8643. there	is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that	all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory	training including those coming by transfer of membership	4986.2214921950945
8644. george e	sweazey writes: there is danger in trying to make admission	to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know	that anything has happened	2997.8305032496123
8645. people appreciate experiences	that demand something of them	247.9331989024835
8646. those who transfer their membership are	no exception to the rule	502.2635541324277
8647. for most of them it will be their first	experience in membership training since this is a recent development	in many churches	3249.042264175093
8648. those coming from other denominations will welcome	the opportunity to become informed	643.9224865297143
8649. the preparatory class is	an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted	with one another	2118.831501736839
8650. it provides a natural transition into the life	of the local church and its organizations	1104.9391163501564
8651. fellowship	the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo	when the group of new members stands before the congregation to	declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship	of the church	5487.1403161047465
8652. this should be a high moment in their lives a	never-to-be-forgotten	experience	641.6422540098936
8653. they should sense the tremendous significance	of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our	lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages	4662.279843063806
8654. every detail of the service merits careful attention- the	hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction	to the congregation the welcome of the congregation	3123.408731729733
8655. this is	a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation	747.5393444121206
8656. it will help	to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church	945.363080760277
8657. it	can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual	growth and decay	1183.0817537011533
8658. the worship service is the natural and logical	time to receive new members into the church	1263.3024888669474
8659. the atmosphere for	this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the	worship experience	1643.2126712566067
8660. psychologically the reception should be the	_ ask the new members to meet thirty	minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge	cards	2608.134638387481
8661. some denominations ask new members to sign personally the	chronological membership register	958.3353167105752
8662. provide a name card for each	_ arrange a	reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together	2030.2302324986347
8663. _ invite sponsors or fellowship	friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service	2123.466376102714
8664. _	introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face	_ lead the congregation in a response of	_ have a reception for new members in the parlor or	_ take a picture of	the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the	_ have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with	new members as guests	5718.821903944794
8665. growth of new members	the church is the family of god	758.4994856752927
8666. the members of the family are drawn together by a common love	for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom	2034.752481277927
8667. every member	of the family must have a vital place in its life	1181.2656841558078
8668. this is no spectator-type	experience; everyone is to be a participant	501.4742496292589
8669. yet the	most difficult problem in the church's program of evangelism is right	at this point- helping new members to become participating growing	parts of the fellowship	4272.151877391958
8670. very easily they may be neglected and eventually	join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive	1258.9519325693168
8671. a study	of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period	revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who	joined the church were lost to the church within seven years	5480.114969083193
8672. one	denomination had a membership of 1419833 at the beginning of the	period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at 1541991-	a net growth of only 122158	3220.4974844676562
8673. yet during the same period there	were 1080062 additions	390.1155503998902
8674. another major church body had 4499608	members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4622444	1252.6157020040444
8675. during	this time 4122354 new members were brought into the fellowship	750.0908554483815
8676. still another denomination had 7360187 members twenty years ago	264.1558982270136
8677. during	this period 7484268 members were received yet the net membership	now is only 9910741	1650.519130313232
8678. these figures indicate that we are losing	almost as many as we are receiving into membership	1256.2089676364608
8679. this problem	is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the	active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship	4298.011070252469
8680. studies of membership trends even in some areas where population	is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net	increase though many new members were received	2977.166354034643
8681. something is wrong when	these things happen	140.8713548735089
8682. the local family of god has failed its	new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare	1574.1834458449391
8683. new members can become participating growing	members	140.16775287900833
8684. but this will not happen merely through the natural process	of social life	787.1054895308524
8685. it must be planned and carefully developed	141.8736280244106
8686. the	entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part	in this dynamic process	1405.7015610070018
8687. if the church has followed the plan	of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership	preparation as outlined earlier in this book the process of assimilation	and growth will be well under way	5766.512120696295
8688. those who enter the front	door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will	not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest	2864.115267831089
8689. however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment	and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship	2798.307645267668
8690. when	they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction	of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into	effective christians	2857.5301428380762
8691. the church expects certain things of	those who become members	557.9734311864274
8692. the new members justifiably expect some things	from their church family:  - welcome into the fellowship	- sincere christian love and understanding  - inspiring	and challenging worship experiences  - social and recreational	activities  - opportunities for christian service	- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	- creative prayer experiences  - guidance in christian	social concerns	men need unity and they need god	1572.9244157936855
8693. care must be taken neither	to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas	about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands	4104.804818666656
8694. the statement also points to a classic paradox: the more men turn	toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but	also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established	the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one	another	5025.482977728416
8695. to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map	and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political	ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race	5319.439925548834
8696. massacres	attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state	of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such	divisions can engender	2722.268543524361
8697. the words of cardinal newman come forcibly	to	mind: oh how we hate one another for the love of god!	the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify	4830.437131464124
8698. institutions require structure form and definition	and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion	943.248281526355
8699. a completely	amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms; to escape	this fate it must rule some things out	2802.7276735390183
8700. for every criterion which	defines what something is at the same time proclaims- implicitly if	not openly- what that something is not	2173.557182475453
8701. some persons are so sensitive	to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether;	in the present context this amounts to the advice that while	being religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense	with churches	6546.915267059418
8702. man is at once a gregarious	animal and a form-creating being	506.0063446647222
8703. having once committed himself to	an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms	for its expression and institutions for its continuance	3471.6624692189775
8704. to propose that	men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing	that they be learned without having schools	1870.5453488407045
8705. both eventualities	are possible logically but practically they are impossible	560.7936722870147
8706. as much	as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally	require the institutions that will direct their steps toward	him	2598.5899589743485
8707. yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men	at odds with their fellows	1635.018031021647
8708. is there any way out of the predicament	165.67758349835538
8709. the only way that i can see is through communication	564.2356332074825
8710. interfaith	communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited	upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our	adversaries	2323.1562278698193
8711. approached creatively it is a high art	141.68909282042213
8712. it is the art	of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that	the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not	thwart god's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary	4032.8576356464
8713. in a certain sense interfaith communication parallels diplomatic	communication among the nation-states	973.588387798618
8714. what are the pertinent	facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history	940.4178363805365
8715. i shall touch on three areas: personal national and theological	560.685745723554
8716. by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality	structure	372.56909019452337
8717. some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological	differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they	can blame distrust denounce and even hate	4462.200983926488
8718. such needs may rise	to pathological proportions	93.73148459956965
8719. modern psychology has shown that paralleling	the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality	in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine	to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured	if it does not exist naturally	6323.220096556708
8720. fortunately the number of	pathological bigots appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake	to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the	rest of us	3544.99549565302
8721. to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices	attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us	2803.2027334707363
8722. interfaith	conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most	unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever	1879.5831042462983
8723. it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must	learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them	that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the	healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies	7302.918552571643
8724. while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith	conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable	1096.7824831265564
8725. the	specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which	has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century	3706.6595028814613
8726. emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the	afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires	1885.7181507495782
8727. no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence	since world war 2 and the number is growing by the year	3054.094674520171
8728. as	an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication	have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between	christians and non-christians in these lands	2601.0732335808307
8729. colonialism alone would	have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity	is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that	repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation	of the other	6211.802131791567
8730. actually however this turns out to be only part of	the picture	637.8536033831331
8731. nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign	religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying	in slumber for centuries	4080.4295107286684
8732. the truth is that any revival of traditional	and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity	and volksgeist which these young nations very much need	2982.5655417818975
8733. insofar	as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life	which constitute ultimate trans-political justifications for their existence	such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which	these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's	6443.183552194329
8734. all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural	communication for which christian missions stand	1095.1014092232085
8735. africans and asians	tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have	produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not	of direct political propaganda	4990.3400264534275
8736. the people hardest hit by this suspicion	are of course christians on the mainland of china	1249.1240540697702
8737. but the	problem extends elsewhere	22.50696143636032
8738. for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists	argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion	1581.9156416588012
8739. in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly christian-	schools to the rejoicing of most of its 7000000 buddhists and	the lament of its 800000 roman catholics	4085.1944543531113
8740. again india has imposed	formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries	and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against	christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru	and his followers is gone	4050.761113770032
8741. the progressive closing of afro-asian	ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation	i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo	4123.194512704228
8742. i was	seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists' world	radio program	1103.066931287702
8743. he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable	number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio	networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them	5795.917837348455
8744. after returning to the united states and raising the money he	discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available	2457.1217191348783
8745. it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval;	they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes	3267.0120276714306
8746. it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost	vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures	and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this	heightening of anti-christian sentiment	4126.980527027952
8747. ironically these are the	groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since	world war 2 while the more established denominations are barely	maintaining pre-war staffs	4316.768337872686
8748. although i have emphasized the	barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between	christians and non-christians in asia the fact is that this development	has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions	themselves	3859.008675645643
8749. the partition of india has hardly improved relations	between hindus and muslims; neither has the establishment of the	state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews	4277.267815917892
8750. i turn finally to several theological developments	93.43586273506577
8751. the modern world has been marked by progressive	disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever	its political form	3048.709165818341
8752. the american constitution was historic at	this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting	an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof	2862.7081594235674
8753. one of our foremost jurists david dudley field has gone so	far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in	the course of human history	4469.27570331791
8754. the trend throughout the world's	religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical	validity of this constitutional enactment	2029.7413330467075
8755. pakistan was created in	1947 expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven	years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed	in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think	their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political	situation	7936.452470481597
8756. what is the point charles adams reports the pakistanis	as asking in demanding an islamic state and society if no	one not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves can say clearly	and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is	4655.180359107066
8757. the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly	secular	749.6536466025256
8758. and while the nation was formerly named the islamic	republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan	1874.9529488058513
8759. comparable trends can be noted elsewhere	65.1352964881848
8760. the new regime	in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor	636.4009623940813
8761. the	religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige	in recent months	1637.2449832540456
8762. during the years when israel was passing from	crisis to crisis- the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of	penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose of national unity	could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious	parties	4595.982822386315
8763. now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction	of tensions the secularists are less disposed to compromise	2359.433992794554
8764. and in this country gustave weigel's delineation of the line between	the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign	served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the	practical autonomy of both church and state	4148.9163571970985
8765. the failure at that time	of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added	a ring of good sense to father weigel's theological argument	4468.614751679861
8766. everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that	governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible-	in a word too human- to warrant any claim of maintaining	partnership with the divine	3942.71339903045
8767. my	father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded	to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands	and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese	souls were going to hell each second because these students were not	over there saving them	7508.940242126754
8768. that mention of this should bring smiles to	our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent	to which attitudes have changed	2982.2820181579173
8769. i do not mean to imply that christians	have adopted the liberal assumption so prevalent in hinduism	that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit	4459.033992852731
8770. leslie	newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council	of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality	for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids	us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it	4463.471681643284
8771. newbiggin's qualification on the christian claim is of considerable	significance	563.7320280375496
8772. the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of	its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation	outside the visible church	2327.980982315826
8773. in mentioning this under salvation	reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine	has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the	world community what that doctrine is	5761.460355344936
8774. when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit	the termination of the human race by human action because	there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify	such a thing they know exactly what they mean	4507.149367622565
8775. of course in prudential	calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against	the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can	be forthcoming than the subject allows	4851.052999152311
8776. yet it seems clear that there	can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave	to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action	2855.1807515806936
8777. i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit	1179.5937473085366
8778. he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks	and danger in general	947.940928057947
8779. he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously	does an evil thing	as it efficaciously does some good	2849.6740395267198
8780. he	is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes	directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both;	of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended	or not directly intended but still both are done while the	evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown	to be among the consequences	5719.480704430615
8781. this is what in a technical sense	to only permit an evil result means	1420.3515579085415
8782. it means to do it	and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect	of the good one primarily does and intends	3015.3013378676483
8783. of course grave guiltiness	may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action	of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits	in this sense the termination of the human race by human action	6408.631564316113
8784. certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives	it is never possible that no world would be preferable to	some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the	destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative	4468.896322810649
8785. naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action	is uncertain this has to be taken into account	3049.610615209233
8786. especially is this	true when because the good effect is remote and speculative while	the evil is certain and grave the action is prohibited	2474.3021264869185
8787. presumably	if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the	evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the	evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation	of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty	in the good or evil effect must be taken into account	8346.383493435993
8788. there must	not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater	probability of actually doing more good than harm	2316.503825834327
8789. if an evil which	is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for	by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every	present certain and immediate good that may have	to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future	evil	7218.923895791582
8790. nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins	in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences	before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences	3465.1789469811847
8791. he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences	of his action	2105.8898135436784
8792. above all he does not debate mere contingencies	and therefore if these are possibly dreadful find himself forced	into inaction	1884.294214714954
8793. he does what he can and may and must without regarding	himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with	guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not	permit in the sense explained	6586.540262363347
8794. mr philip toynbee	writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as	likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near	future if the present situation continues	5605.856672556705
8795. if it continues indefinitely	it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will	be made and that the devastation will begin	2181.911593656099
8796. against such a termination	of human life on earth by human action he then proposes as an	alternative that we negotiate at once with the russians and get the	best terms which are available that we deliberately negotiate	from comparative weakness	6415.5206910314955
8797. he bravely attempts to face this alternative	realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome	namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few	years	2990.7220967714393
8798. this would be by far the better choice when it is a question	of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination	of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to	destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish	6763.851087066132
8799. nevertheless the	consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified:	it is a possible result however improbable; the worst and	least probable result; if it didn't prevail mankind would	still be given the opportunity of prevailing; for surely	anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility	of nuclear war	5136.344735857494
8800. if we have not thought and made a decision entirely	in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following	simple test: have we decided how we are to kill the other	members of our household in the event of our being less injured than	they are	7300.3902477976935
8801. thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward	from the likely eventuality; it is no longer to be formulated in terms	of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate	effect or the thing to be done	4124.801475124884
8802. several of the replies	to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology	with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the	actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be	made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in	danger of this evil	7512.936059644906
8803. it is worse for a nation to give in to evil	h than to run the risk of annihilation	1727.00152103965
8804. i am consciously prepared	to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident' rather	than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design	3891.0055535349215
8805. but	i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need	not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against	accidents or by limiting war	3086.2071005429216
8806. quoting mr kennan's	phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably	to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a	policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war	5747.950469854888
8807. if	asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility	most men will choose the latter	1737.096175808832
8808. if h philip toynbee	is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk	of nuclear war i think he is right	3483.6858464676943
8809. i do not accept that the choice	is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war	1258.5674410884853
8810. even	professor arnold toynbee agreeing with his son does so in these	terms: compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of	the destruction of the human race all other evils are lesser evils h	5612.132925714126
8811. let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving	the human race at whatever the temporary price may be	2176.969632000587
8812. mr	philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the	anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four if he believed	communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then	he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the	risk of a communist world	7315.030402265831
8813. even a nuclear holocaust is a little less	frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the	earth until doomsday	2172.827453550259
8814. no political order or economic system is	so clearly contrary to nature	964.4610347997317
8815. but one does not have to affirm the existence	of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order	in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to	affirm the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted	in social institutions and social relationships except in the context	of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force	5691.095242706726
8816. on their	way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo	of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility	for its preservation	4643.400483140684
8817. not to repel injury and uphold and improve	pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice	that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep	slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand	4471.771935225587
8818. toynbee	seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social	embodiment	1642.5701284961353
8819. i would far rather die after a russian occupation of	this country- by some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly	by atomisation	2309.4245018777588
8820. would such an act of refusal be useful	250.35896175532466
8821. he does	not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the	proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation	in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order	to reverse the consequences of that surrender	4592.865093625474
8822. he wants to be	brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless-	far far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956	3886.2464234048953
8823. this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by	creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited	weapons	2737.8756162157943
8824. it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other	than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned	more positive means for attaining it in the past	5316.418453726272
8825. it is	no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso	that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance	by occupied peoples	2733.419548742596
8826. hope for the future h would lie in the	natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop	3260.483844209647
8827. this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted	to the very last; it is to stride along the steep slope downward	2729.8424126280056
8828. that is why it is	so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision	as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from	any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities	or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related	to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures	5577.858276097317
8829. finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful	analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end	of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination	the same thing must be said in connection with the question	of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate	this end	8428.438427412362
8830. we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought	about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle	for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that	in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence	among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know	not what future	5649.382052634267
8831. much more than shelter housing symbolizes social status	a sense of belonging acceptance within a given group or neighborhood	identification with particular cultural values and social institutions	feelings of pride and worth aspirations and hopes basic to	human well-being	6218.88048751387
8832. for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination	in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow	upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans	2856.962747335609
8833. few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure	to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders	3275.5432580079623
8834. this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying	their professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for the human	aspirations of racial minority groups in this country	2975.022531494738
8835. it is not surprising	that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association	of real estate boards and its local associations	have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure	5317.0019792763715
8836. how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing	restrictions based on race religion or ethnic attachment	1887.05458363008
8837. what	does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest	1401.149882747315
8838. what	ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social	change	1259.8600557490286
8839. what social ethical and theological insights can the	church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation	2595.7735268521856
8840. recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan university's public	affairs center sought some answers to these questions	1577.7114551041834
8841. several	new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium	of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists	social ethicists and theologians	3675.781737254638
8842. here in an atmosphere	of forthrightness and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular	insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing	and the part each man present played in it	3639.8543632008536
8843. for a number of years	wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business	leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty	and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their	responsibility for public policy	6336.464320120203
8844. this article presents our observations	of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the	faculty and students saw them	2327.3074656271256
8845. such conversation quickly reveals	an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most	realtors	1636.2925546560573
8846. within the membership of this group as has been found true	of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready	portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply	serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between	them	4762.373262537922
8847. professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving	the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner	2822.9773107941737
8848. but as	conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another	image emerges that of considerable power and influence in the community	2165.4665652429894
8849. obviously much more than customer expectation is determining	the realtor's role	750.2434885159146
8850. judgments are continually rendered regarding	the potential buyers' income educational level and above all racial	extraction; and whether these would qualify them for congenial	happy relations to other people in certain community areas	3559.0986328021054
8851. though the reference to race was stricken by the association	in 1950 being an agent of such detrimental influences	still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to	avoid	3332.916157070472
8852. the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently	expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed stigma they believed	would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white	particularly negro peoples into all-white restricted areas	5755.772393500377
8853. they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real	estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause	or reform and this was no longer to be a pro	3450.346503486099
8854. obviously	what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional	with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing	of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper	meaning and associations of one's work	5921.658093157321
8855. these men- for the most	part educated in our best new england colleges well established	financially and socially in the community- under kindly but insistent	probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data	for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the	people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually	follow their occasional breach of a client-service relationship	5802.305996972326
8856. this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present	realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the	power and respectability of the realtors increase	4301.345288826703
8857. as our discussion	continued the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation	of their way of operating became evident	1882.7562311339273
8858. realtors	live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as	members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic	leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers	etc	5689.3644292626095
8859. from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that	shapes his moral understanding	941.6187889318641
8860. it seems to us that choices exercised	by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas:	the various ways in which they interpret a particular social	issue; their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political	processes; and most pervasively their interpretation of	who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in	a technical fragmented society	8588.272223159194
8861. most of the realtors minimized	their own understanding of and role in the racial issue pleading	that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society	2851.2218083382563
8862. there is some reality to this; the commission on race and housing	concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate	men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any	other segment of the american population	6550.413478737564
8863. but such a reaction obscures	the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and	its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices	2861.726028513431
8864. also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment	continually employed	1182.6172000365825
8865. like business and university groups generally	these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and	psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions	they make	2866.3529871578276
8866. realtors both generally and in this group have invariably	equated residential integration with a decline in property values	a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension	3699.0459928258665
8867. recent	studies by the commission on race and housing and others however	point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion	2719.7577919481373
8868. there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated	residentially without great loss of property values the white population	having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation	of the negroes' desire for well-kept housing privacy etc	6181.667719885869
8869. data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial	group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property	values before the group comes in	3644.457070754767
8870. often they are able to get in	only because the area is declining economically	1416.403154432274
8871. significantly	no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of	the six volumes	that present the commission's findings	2159.8650790924175
8872. no one anticipates any radical	shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits	the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must	surely be raised	4824.803438748645
8873. the role of both church and university as sources	of information and settings within which the implications of such information	may be explored needs consideration	2589.839527383234
8874. relevant facts	however	extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance	of harmonious neighborhoods	1413.020077548119
8875. discussion of minority housing necessarily	involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic	conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity	the function and limitations of government in the securing of such	equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents	of racial agitation and strife	4952.450763732689
8876. realtors realize of course that they are involved in an	increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities	for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities	for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination	in housing	6535.079184728793
8877. on the positive side recent federal action has largely	undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position;	anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted	by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the	tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage	4543.977496260411
8878. realtors in attendance	at the colloquium expressed interest for example in connecticut's	new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would	like to have to obey but in support of which none had been willing	to go on public record	6559.263501170835
8879. as far as they were aware the connecticut	association of real estate boards had not officially opposed	the bill's passage or lobbied in its support	2601.633002914072
8880. in 1957 the real estate boards of new york city	actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination	law	2584.960336761649
8881. official reasoning: the bill was a wanton invasion	there are sins of omission as	well as commission; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations	either negative or positive plays a large part in the public	acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively	enforced	4955.9846327658115
8882. judicial opinion since the supreme court decision	on shelley v kraemer has rendered racial restrictive	covenants unenforcible	2135.976805838169
8883. such a decision should have placed a powerful	weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little	evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated	the principle in such clauses	3840.1229352049427
8884. in the states that have passed	laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing	support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage	through additional legislation could help remove the label of social	reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to	avoid	6918.030550458059
8885. but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially	to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority	buyers into all-white neighborhoods	2867.163754869139
8886. one of the roles of	the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with	the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities	offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise	of broad social responsibilities in their work	6676.626575600912
8887. but responsiveness to	these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human	good and not simply as a professional white american good	2727.8652398121344
8888. such	judgments are meaningful only	in so far as persons are members of a world	let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is	also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive	5496.8935840084005
8889. that community	of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and	the concrete norm of all moral judgment	2020.5954961065945
8890. racial discrimination is wrong	then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying	to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the	grain of creation and against the will of the creator	6172.418444299654
8891. thus moral issues	concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take	on theological dimensions	1256.5006809441288
8892. over the years	individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable	unity in the methods and practices employed	3036.5717492727044
8893. most realtors and	real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people	with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions	2323.7521821007626
8894. but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow	sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already	noted	3043.850264068711
8895. our faculty and students pressed this issue more than	any other	500.49197287573634
8896. as a theologian in the group pointed out a professional	was before the modern period of technical specialization one who	professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use	of his particular skills	5912.659237712369
8897. if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there	are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization:	science and religion	2870.1843302171724
8898. science is placing in our	hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom	2123.7442179301147
8899. religion	or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build	a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether	we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed	4030.032332470398
8900. how can we	have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge	1413.890609479166
8901. we	may feel pessimistic at the outlook	93.96439889203143
8902. and yet there is a note of	hope	because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is	also giving us atomic vision	4291.328828590521
8903. we are looking inside the atom and seeing	there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material	a universe that in a word is not matter but music	3339.6940654600485
8904. and it is	in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration	of our faith	3026.125188827088
8905. to see this vision in perspective	we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new	power from the atom	2457.234053541047
8906. you know that i could hold right here in my	hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb	that dropped on hiroshima	4453.912707671982
8907. it was only about the size of a baseball;	but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of	20000 tons of tnt	2593.1944788649985
8908. that is enough tnt to fill the tower	of the empire state building; and with the availability of bombs	of that size war became a new problem	4292.398504289173
8909. now we might have restricted	the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium	because it is found in only a few places in the world	2984.549035329956
8910. but we had hardly	started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we	were faced with the hydrogen bomb	3253.46352581163
8911. hydrogen is just as plentiful as	uranium is scarce	264.870242382748
8912. we know that we have hydrogen in water; water is	f and the h stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen in wood	and hydrogen in our bodies	4476.742485775258
8913. i have calculated that if i could snap	my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen	in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of	the kind that fell on hiroshima	4375.063285520213
8914. i won't try the experiment but	i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let	ourselves go there would be quite an explosion	5005.693562048524
8915. and then think how	little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware	bay or in the ocean beyond	2175.4964493751436
8916. salt water is still f the same hydrogen	is there	559.4808293306074
8917. and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the	destructive power we hold in our hands today	1887.2072286796483
8918. of course there	is also an optimistic side to the picture	753.9197179794888
8919. for if i knew the secret	of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity	i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power	in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories	in the entire united states for some days	5150.338744250442
8920. and think if we all knew	this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility	company we would make	3474.520725546759
8921. with just the hydrogen of our bodies we	could run the world for years	947.8616153711042
8922. then think of delaware bay and the	ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years	to come	3695.0545511334763
8923. it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world	provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone	everywhere	2035.8541744116355
8924. now let us see where this power	comes from	394.93939910808194
8925. to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate	first of all how small the atom is	1877.8828516381964
8926. i have been trying to make this	clear to my own class in chemistry	1406.9623046297888
8927. one night there were some dried	peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little	group of atoms; and i asked myself a question: suppose i	had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an	area would they cover	5078.411388281155
8928. i calculated first that there are	about an octillion atoms in the average human body; that is a figure	one with 27 ciphers quite a large number	4283.04150221633
8929. then i calculated that a	million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator; a billion	peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic; a trillion peas	would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;	and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia	5341.434169175751
8930. i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at	this rate so i decided to take another measure- the whole state of	pennsylvania	3876.965431801093
8931. imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania	but instead of snowing snow it snows peas; so we get the whole state	covered with peas about four feet deep	3115.2784528544694
8932. you can imagine what it would	look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against	the houses and covering the cars; pennsylvania thus blanketed would	contain about a quintillion peas	5504.638774673438
8933. but we still have a long	way to go	261.92453157144325
8934. next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas	of the entire globe- north america south america europe asia	and africa all covered with peas four feet deep; then we have	sextillion peas	5637.90131054033
8935. next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole	earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect	250 planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these	with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion	4696.235355391125
8936. finally we	go into the farthest reaches of the milky way; we get 250000 planets;	we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last	we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body	6547.147714428181
8937. so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are	793.4979104589123
8938. speck- and space	now although an atom is small we can still in	imagination have a look at it	2591.706908751182
8939. let us focus on an atom of calcium from	the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow	a magic alice in wonderland growing pill	3337.798250949215
8940. i start growing rapidly	and this calcium atom grows along with me	959.9306673462054
8941. i shoot up through the	roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond	the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and	fifty million miles long	3657.4243784038895
8942. then this atom of calcium will swell to something	like a great balloon a hundred yards across a balloon big enough	to put a football field inside	4302.278485045949
8943. and if you should step inside of such	a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you	would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your	feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs	4482.244492850051
8944. these	balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the	electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action	create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring	atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone	7349.115674855222
8945. since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether	there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom	2195.5001894524776
8946. so you look down	there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head	of a pin	3063.619934832185
8947. this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus	168.81862472550907
8948. even if the	atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still	only about the size of a pinhead	3498.1112757073047
8949. it is this atomic nucleus that contains	the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged	electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly all the mass	and the atomic energy	3344.989434250901
8950. you may ask what else there is and the	answer is nothing- nothing but empty space	1883.0603708602362
8951. and since you are made	of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too	1102.6290662947954
8952. if i could put	your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze	these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge	you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole	was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you	could see on this piece of paper	8650.354068561295
8953. someone has remarked that this is	certainly the ultimate in reducing	501.23904389723486
8954. at any rate it shows us how immaterial	we are	557.2947692346013
8955. now this 1920 view of the	atom was on the whole a discouraging picture	948.0589266077416
8956. for we believed that the	electrons	obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore	the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics the	whole is no more than the sum of the parts	5964.282843842599
8957. so if you are made of	atoms you are just a big machine; and since the universe is also made	of atoms it is just a supermachine	2886.9609232207563
8958. and this would mean that we	live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect	bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely	predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit	or human freedom	7022.448355790019
8959. and this is why so many scientists a half a century	ago were agnostics or atheists	1268.8299602530928
8960. then came the scientific revolution	in the late 1920's	393.56355324279605
8961. a suggestion from louis de broglie a	physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles	but waves	2035.399061797701
8962. and to see the meaning of this new picture imagine	that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom	and have a look at it in the way we view it today	5947.801600883451
8963. now as you step	inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you	see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface	of a pond when you drop a stone into it	4156.12123056561
8964. these ripples spread	out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral	1646.0328428994962
8965. and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from	the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear	music	3145.385013328015
8966. it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra	playing a symphony	2389.678306386666
8967. harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure	are there; and as this music ebbs and flows there is an antiphonal	chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of	the entire universe	3552.9747507289417
8968. and so today when we examine the structure of our	knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude	that the best word to describe our universe is music	5329.749647099425
8969. the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts	lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state	1731.605355833569
8970. some of	the island is sand and is not suitable for living	965.0290476873924
8971. the island folk	have their living almost entirely from summer visitors; the rest is	obtained from harbor scallops	1581.1772544800313
8972. during about three and a half months	of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland	to the island carrying passengers food and cars; but the	rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland	nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime	8152.620269528603
8973. this	is a fine trip too on a good day	376.93715733887086
8974. with martha's vineyard on one	side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about	three hours	3281.7402568927123
8975. to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect	the united states of america in the nineteenth century	1727.5280098987962
8976. how far	and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging	in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age	3877.5221066046915
8977. to what	extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political	life and institutions of the country	1879.2804252817582
8978. a complete picture is	impossible- partly because of the limitations of space partly because	for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian	faith data are unobtainable	4461.380959487753
8979. even more of an obstacle is the difficulty	of separating the influence of christianity from other factors	1422.462799903331
8980. although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate	some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at	least one creative factor	4095.462620557077
8981. at times we can say that it was the major	factor	500.6656201425147
8982. what in some ways was the most important aspect was the	impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation	2820.870426024256
8983. as	we have seen a growing proportion although in 1914 still a minority	were members of churches	1405.5753771790357
8984. presumably those who did not have a formal	church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater	or less extent	3493.9791099755225
8985. many of them had once been members of a church	or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or	another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse	3344.150911869394
8986. the form of christianity	to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of	the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century	immigration; for still others mostly of the nineteenth-century	immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was	eastern orthodoxy	7097.96706679175
8987. upon all of them played the intellectual social	political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the	nation	1573.2437102273946
8988. upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through	them had had a share in making the individual what he was	3498.636703064225
8989. yet	to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual	showed the effects of christianity would be impossible	2164.851110397243
8990. at	best only an approximation could be arrived at	393.28536527923904
8991. to generalize for the	entire nation would be absurd	263.00276292070373
8992. for instance we cannot know whether	even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards	of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members	in the population rose	5189.394849128477
8993. the temptation is to say that as the percentage	of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised	by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general	level	3456.607399076609
8994. yet this cannot be proved	22.237310380526935
8995. we know that in the early part	of the century many protestant congregations took positive action	against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority	subscribed	2989.5791323130056
8996. thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance	of charges against their members of drunkenness fighting malicious	gossip lying cheating sexual irregularities gambling horse racing	and failure to pay just debts	5001.394096681441
8997. if guilty the offender might be excluded	from membership	262.3105258448331
8998. as church membership burgeoned such measures	faded into desuetude	391.3711619568758
8999. but whether this was accompanied by a general	lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know	1885.7196130948382
9000. what	we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point	out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects	of the life of the nation	4645.783825750637
9001. we have already hinted at the fashion in	which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life	1567.376604742816
9002. we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals	of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain	those ideals through reform movements through programmes for bringing	the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards	and through leaders in the government	7788.158419176888
9003. throughout the	nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american	society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock	2178.7788211298384
9004. by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning	to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals	but also through its attitude towards organized labour	4840.917303061027
9005. in the twentieth	century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of	the nineteenth-century immigration	1409.5996091002185
9006. the ideals	of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the	older stock	1643.5897532544618
9007. thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic	songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis	smith while a student in andover theological	seminary	2979.3590690532833
9008. with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it	breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals	3278.3939462753137
9009. the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by	the christian faith	938.6709894928923
9010. here was what was called the american dream namely	the effort to build a structure which would be something new in	history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it	5474.983863478352
9011. later	in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine	lee bates daughter and granddaughter of new england	congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in	1893 america the beautiful with the words o beautiful	for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom	beat across the wilderness	5257.126042403809
9012. america america god mend	thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control thy liberty in law	h	2354.0854699743313
9013. o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine	alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears	1568.3958812150806
9014. america america	god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from	sea to shining sea	2582.4885758502746
9015. the american dream was compounded of	many strains	165.95546575064083
9016. some were clearly of christian origin among them the	great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian	liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of	the land	4836.514008047015
9017. some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection	as the fountain-head of the american hope	1426.9749050395023
9018. here too must	be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration	emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman	2820.8457574201916
9019. we	must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of	myth- among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder	all of them out of a christian background	3435.23820375347
9020. with	such a dream arising at least in part from the protestant heritage	of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation	it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete	expression	6199.49055730866
9021. a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or	remove social ills	939.1880665506256
9022. significantly the initiation and leadership	of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in	the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of	new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian	congregationalism	6484.94367503455
9023. several of the movements were given a marked	impetus by revivalism	501.8181880229672
9024. quakers some from new england had a larger	share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted	2117.399939142505
9025. we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england	ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter	day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the	american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american	home missionary society the american bible society and new	england theology	5140.3426715273945
9026. the atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence	in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its ills	3247.3265989550055
9027. the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding	to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents	to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the	millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability	cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists	4818.490058813854
9028. we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind	which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles	and the pietism of the continent of europe- among them prison	reform anti-slavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions	of labour the inner mission and the red cross	7524.684193231585
9029. we	cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation	of collective ills	1580.9398956609707
9030. a few of the more prominent must serve	as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose	2613.2285851750557
9031. several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the	century	649.3100222225542
9032. some disappeared with the attainment	of their purpose	248.161245600806
9033. still others sprang up late in the century to meet	conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age	1893.4246921233785
9034. anti-slavery movement	the movement to end negro slavery began	before 1815 and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil	war emancipation was achieved	4297.241262396632
9035. long before 1815 the christian	conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act	accordingly	1422.5505449578495
9036. for example in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting	of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves	and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not	comply	5145.16604786139
9037. in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian	strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental	congress to abolish slavery	2602.469946974686
9038. as we have seen methodism early took	a stand against slavery	754.7922927700413
9039. beginning at least as far back as 1789 various	baptist bodies condemned slavery	795.9024688131374
9040. after 1815 anti-slavery	sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant	background of the older stock	2119.479641818179
9041. the nineteenth-century immigration	whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned	for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the	northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out	or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves	4692.876371692104
9042. the anti-slavery movement	took many forms	64.95410786757215
9043. benjamin lundy a quaker was	a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies	943.3592431844532
9044. it was	he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison	to the subject	1420.42570214961
9045. garrison massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage	was by temperament and conviction a reformer	936.6429928375886
9046. chiefly remembered	because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional	abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among	them women's rights prohibition and justice to the indians	5009.069679040722
9047. incurably	optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout	baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john	greenleaf whittier he eventually attacked the orthodox	churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery	issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox	and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible	5423.691916698868
9048. a marked	impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals	968.1588745100574
9049. finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis	on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of	the anti-slavery campaign	2595.387060942624
9050. theodore dwight weld was	especially active	65.41987026606735
9051. weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational	ministers	498.77421240950025
9052. as a youth he became one of finney's band	of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men	2346.914346393828
9053. a strong temperance	advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles	stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the anti-slavery	cause	2330.8162971479023
9054. a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological	seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery	position	3476.11580409292
9055. the majority then went to the infant oberlin	166.21675979369147
9056. they and	others employed some of finney's techniques as they sought to win	adherents to the cause	2118.54654589142
9057. weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions	of such men as joshua r giddings and edwin m stanton	enlisted john quincy adams and helped provide ideas which underlay	harriet beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin	3579.0124411506126
9058. he shunned	publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame	560.1253981902048
9059. wendell phillips	from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens	was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher	1573.1531020866908
9060. although he	later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently	outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian	3466.765119610421
9061. he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition	but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the	freedmen and for prohibition	2853.2415384499573
9062. the anti-slavery movement and	other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership	and financial undergirding by arthur tappan and his younger	brother lewis tappan	3687.385875782832
9063. individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power	were transmuted at death into awesome spirits; they were almost immediately	worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities	2860.418099232898
9064. their	direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also	the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of	the universe	4093.786275331144
9065. royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly	achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power	941.1341677156128
9066. thus	the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less	puissant ancestors	1634.7459259994462
9067. but this eminence was not without its weighty	responsibilities	259.26948692547
9068. since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe	of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for	the benefit of the living	4297.084954409209
9069. the royal ritual generated power into the	other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the	spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs	of the world	3772.183315842159
9070. proper ritual observance at any level of society was	capable of generating power for use in the spirit world; but naturally	the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely	powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the	universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom	7238.004863453107
9071. this is the	familiar system of cosmic government	167.4168662052721
9072. the chinese emperor by	proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers	745.2770785493445
9073. he regulated	the dualities of light and darkness yang and yin which are	locked in eternal struggle	1414.7673165081337
9074. by swaying the balance between them he	effected the alternation of the seasons	1182.1027134056933
9075. his power was so great that	he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given	ear or been deaf to petitions	2466.575260725716
9076. in this system no man is exempt	from obligations	394.39934502520947
9077. failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's	family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid	standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead	2849.6884732314684
9078. and to	offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing	of countrywide disasters	2363.522882366147
9079. the family home was in fact a temple;	and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in	nature	1717.9668532882447
9080. the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and	in every fear	1427.736259841339
9081. the common belief was that there existed one	moral order which included everything	784.8126902684711
9082. the dead controlled the material	prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of	conduct in order not to weaken that control	3879.885433448252
9083. men believed they could	control nature by obeying a moral code	503.0999608865268
9084. if the moral code were flouted	the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous	result could be floods plague or famine	3896.526183057658
9085. modern westerners	have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material	largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the	connection	2599.35595601016
9086. living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of	village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view	the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only	without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse	effects in his worldly fortunes	6921.291901598255
9087. basing action on the empirical determination	of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no	powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation	from the constraint of silent burial urns	3670.407836523006
9088. in china	the magical system par excellence was taoism	392.36952821392725
9089. the taoists were quietist	mystics who saw an unchanging unity- the tao- underlying	all phenomena	1094.755420634065
9090. it was this timeless unity that was all-important and	not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality	2344.8752135017326
9091. the taoists	believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation;	in other words they were actually an organization of magicians	2167.948346035274
9092. mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical	concepts	563.222111867943
9093. after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced	into china it underwent extensive changes	1099.9915437323873
9094. during its flowering in	the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package	to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested	philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader	5654.701430959887
9095. mahayana	had gods and magic a pantheon heavens and hells and gorgeously	appareled priests monks and nuns all of whom wielded power over	souls in the other world	3001.709707285269
9096. the self-realized mahayana saint possessed	superhuman powers and magic	392.58333210701414
9097. the mahayana that developed in the	north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world	into a huge magical garden	2481.3670817276784
9098. in its monastic form mahayana was merely	an organization of magic-practicing monks who catered	to the chinese faith in the supernatural	3034.782369850728
9099. nonmagical confucianism	was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different	orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government	2468.320455595628
9100. confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power	962.5125717717816
9101. if a man lived a classical life he need not fear the spirits- for	only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him	2472.733686016117
9102. but let us not be	mistaken about confucian virtue; this was not virtue as we	understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief	in magic manipulation	5158.784517731181
9103. to the confucian virtue simply meant	mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual	and three thousand minor ones	2172.8532928898035
9104. propriety was synonymous with ritual	observance the mark of a true gentleman	961.2628392682188
9105. to live correctly in an	interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive	for man's fate	1728.7551454146057
9106. this in brief was the historical background	out of which zen emerged	958.9897246093212
9107. promoters of zen to the west record	its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of	taoism and indian mahayana buddhism	2467.100622682919
9108. but the marvelous person	that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality	than indian speculation- he possesses magical powers and can	use them to order nature and to redeem souls	5347.5601519273605
9109. proponents of zen to	the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism	in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist	ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic	3232.7316556191467
9110. but in the chinese	mind there was little difference between the two- the bonzes	were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be	3696.5171225927224
9111. actually	zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism	790.2710330358784
9112. the ch'an sect may have derived its metaphysic from	mahayana but its psychology was pure early taoist	2126.523026050226
9113. this is well	evidenced	by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen: the idea of	the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and	perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness- a	union with the infinite with the tao- could be effected	4834.550475081853
9114. in fact	the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so	uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature	of taoism	3904.89393052667
9115. so too was the insistence on the relativity of the	external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by	consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by	pure indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating	consciousness	4320.084313667186
9116. zen maintains that cognitive things	are only the surface of experience	754.1062266698206
9117. one of its features attractive	to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred	texts	1739.4886509139747
9118. one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures	for use in an outhouse	1401.2761815100564
9119. but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom	of action for which the westerner mistakes it	1410.6481204006298
9120. it is simply that	in taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms- books words	or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness	are considered only the surface of experience	5341.671215510005
9121. the truth- the	eternal truth- is not transmittable by words	375.7338257809264
9122. reality is considered	not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but	a positive handicap	1882.9707898067554
9123. the technique of reality confusion- the use of	paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality- originated	with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism: the	koan is not basically a new device	3774.859839377403
9124. it is important for an	understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of	the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man	4079.113067718635
9125. in the supernatural	atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever	concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature: popular religion	aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers	3244.8701656733597
9126. and this is only	natural- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest	wonder drug	2131.6138358889903
9127. early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed	at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being	achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence	2749.6242678293256
9128. but	this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers	1176.867382304711
9129. the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world	of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power	2320.238014628806
9130. thus the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was	distilled down to a bare self-seeking and for this reason the mystic	in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation	4988.853259606403
9131. as the zen	literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in	seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers	2861.365670742728
9132. the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed	ability to perform miracles	1401.8053495244396
9133. exponents of zen often insist	that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism	of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of	the universe	2987.741016667303
9134. in support of this stories from the early literature are	cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power	3039.0263960845573
9135. but	actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters	were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of	popular credulity: hwang pah one day going up mount	tien tai h which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats	with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light	5369.436944631721
9136. they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while	until they came to a river roaring with torrent	3250.391806227105
9137. there being no bridge	the master had to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed	the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow	him	3219.3423060617442
9138. thereupon hwang pah said: if i knew thou art an arhat	i would have doubled you up before thou got over there! the monk	then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised	him as a true mahayanist	6220.531615617358
9139. a second tale shows still	more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess:	on one occasion yang shan saw a stranger monk flying	through the air	3262.6694414455355
9140. when that monk came down and approached him with a	respectful salutation he asked: where art thou from	2367.999436272459
9141. early	this morning replied the other i set out from india	500.79874490153935
9142. why said the teacher art thou so late	251.31521229947444
9143. i stopped	responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries	639.3957802237635
9144. thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan	yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me	2581.3687866147807
9145. then	the monk praised yang shan saying: i have come over to china	in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya	and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india	went back through the air	4303.065942191528
9146. in the popular chinese	mind ch'an was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that	dominated	2119.4621149035183
9147. a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical	carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes	1568.2166139712224
9148. to the	zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings	who have to be appeased	2109.7382095782673
9149. part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists	in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings	1409.8977968333384
9150. modern zen presentation	to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian highly pragmatic	nature of the zen belief- scriptures are burned to make fire	action is based on direct self-confidence and so on	5193.521824566181
9151. this picture	of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such	zendo formulas as: o you demons and other spiritual beings	i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters	of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith	5030.917243767185
9152. pope leo 13 on the 13th day of december 1898 granted	the following indulgences: an indulgence of three hundred days is	granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a	quarter of an hour	6067.302155363171
9153. a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions	is granted once a month for the daily reading	1259.399100512442
9154. pope pius the sixth	at rome in april 1778 wrote the following: the faithful	should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures: for these	are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone	to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate	errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times	8329.209190271511
9155. the	american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore	urged the catholic people to read the holy bible	1881.995852436404
9156. we hope	they said that no family can be found amongst us without a	correct version of the holy scriptures	2816.2500155095317
9157. they recommended also	that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night	prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures	2730.795297731075
9158. since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred	scriptures be read the following taken from the holy bible	will prove a means of grace and a source of great	spiritual blessing	5351.38759441616
9159. do not wonder that	i said to thee you must be born again	786.2537533181153
9160. but as the one	who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior; for	it is written you shall be holy because i am holy	4634.7354468133

9165. you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins	786.4265416929885
9166. and if our gospel also is veiled it is veiled	only to those who are perishing	1879.0108301815585
9167. in their case the god of this	world satan has blinded their unbelieving minds that they should	not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image	of god	3748.4288320454507
9168. for his workmanship	the new birth	is effected through the word of god	not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible through the word of	god	3918.6358173357985
9169. of his own will he has begotten	us by the word of truth	790.3970723492783
9170. amen amen	i say to thee unless a man be born again of water symbol of the	word of god see ephesians 5:26 and the spirit he cannot enter	into the kingdom of god	5494.389695897302

9176. we know that no one who is born of god commits sin	964.6560154849082
9177. the new nature received at the time of regeneration	is divine and holy and as the believer lives under the power	if we are born of	if you know that he god is just	righteous know that everyone also who does what is just righteous	if we are	born of god we love god	5222.001512879377

9179. because	we love the brethren	14.842148290447534

9188. new birth	for in christ jesus	neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of	any account	1563.0883008338226

9318. havana was filled with an excitement which you could see	in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices	2463.838923666187
9319. the hated dictator batista had fled	65.36127768936485
9320. rumors flew from lip to lip	that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains	where he had fought batista for five years	2855.4675311050414
9321. already the city was	filled with barbudos the bearded war-dirty revolutionaries carrying	carbines waving to the crowds that lined the prado	3046.837363442609
9322. and	then castro himself did come bearded smiling; yet if you looked closely	you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips	2853.583439554667
9323. at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper	behind this man	1642.1890619542653
9324. i am sure that castro was happy too about that support	500.93565812128816

9327. my own earliest	memories are of exiles: my three brothers and i were taken often	to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed	on to fight the dictator machado	5119.133352635231
9328. when it was my turn i too	printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see	his regime topple	2317.4535059855316
9329. none of us was aware that the biggest fight was	still ahead	953.513440101949
9330. i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana	501.545294496254
9331. within a week however i began to suspect that something was	wrong	955.7634811414503
9332. for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred	261.8340928194086
9333. he spent	long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge	956.0764420495079
9334. he	showed us how he dealt with his enemies: he executed them before	tv cameras	1094.917489234567
9335. on home sets children were watching the death throes	of men who were shot before the paredon the firing wall	2803.364637490401
9336. castro's	reforms	0.20041515
9337. he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance	248.8072506373006
9338. new	schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation: any	academic degree earned during batista's regime was invalid	1860.759402789715
9339. economic aid	0.30041514999999996
9340. he had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily he cut	all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator	or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room	3459.0537674522734
9341. under	another law hundreds of farms were seized	248.32606529655445
9342. farm workers had their wages	cut almost in half	259.3731714856525
9343. of this only 50 cents a day was paid in cash	the rest in script usable only in people's stores	2828.3775556088412
9344. a	suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist	370.13906740645314
9345. in my mind	i began to review: his use of hate to gain support; his people's	courts; his division of society into two classes one the hero	the other the villain	5012.568099711786
9346. but most disturbing of all were the advisers	he called to sit with him in the palace; many came from communist	countries	2180.7098598414887
9347. what should i do about it i asked myself	393.71845395231173
9348. i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon	373.416026120033
9349. there	was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him mobs would appear outside	our windows shouting paredon! paredon! h   what	should i do	4110.32543597133
9350. i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario	now: the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors; the thump	and whir of our new presses	2596.5905911226914
9351. here was a powerful ready-made medium	but it could speak only if i told it to	1882.1086014329292
9352. then one day early	in january 1960 i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware	of the crucifix	2029.3889168153405
9353. it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had	given me	964.1940537019875
9354. i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind	me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner	2848.156645178671
9355. now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness	in his eyes saying:   you will lose the paper	3483.400210038469
9356. you may	lose your life	14.812078958090831
9357. but do you have any choice	64.67728697442449
9358. i knew in that	moment that i did not have any choice	631.271628802058
9359. from that day on i began	to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in	fidel castro's regime	3024.180361321417
9360. too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly	either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to lift all	those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth	h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like hey h	lookit mr america h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles		4202.633100535648
9361. after all a guy's gotta	have a little ego!   therefore it's a genuine pleasure	to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had	to train in secret h has never heard one unkind word from his parents	h and never has been taunted by his schoolmates!	this happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new	junior mr canada- henri de courcy	8776.846297366532
9362. far from discouraging	henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments	947.9459009807724
9363. instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they	personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority	professor roland claude	3261.7388246821806
9364. and they couldn't have entrusted	henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles	from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis	anticus of the leg h and better still he knows just what	exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine	them with for fast fast muscle growth	5372.277233320961
9365. that's because the	good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal	health studio which is located at 1821 mt royal east in montreal	3882.2765401917013
9366. undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning	pupils	785.200135825182
9367. there's gaetan d'amours who is our newest mr canada	h jean-paul senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago	h jack boissoneault who was with us last month h charles harve	who recently won the most muscular man subdivision award	in the event h and a host of others	7338.156795435718
9368. yesiree h	the professor knows his muscles!   now when henri was just	12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds	and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight	3782.0324657035644
9369. about that time	he began reading	and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining	2356.6121208918157
9370. seeing	so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value	of those two wonder-working	weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they	could do for him	3456.0165089228067
9371. well sir h they did real great! for	in almost less time than it takes to tell it henri's bodyweight was	increasing rapidly	3441.661583808013
9372. of course he did some exercising h he's crazy	about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction	with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle	on his skinny frame	3666.8147222849593
9373. henri has always had shapely legs from swimming	and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much	2833.583168104211
9374. but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body	261.6505708443334
9375. it was muscular	but it wasn't symmetrical	140.81597147966426
9376. a real 'nothing' torso says	henri	43.695575482082475
9377. it never seemed to widen h it just got longer and longer	962.7927705224432
9378. that's when he went to professor claude	93.87472795438447
9379. and at	once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct	it	2117.548261108871
9380. in his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment	since vic tanny	1258.2724917214389
9381. mr claude is a specialist in torso development	and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull	super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is	a or pushing movement which accents one sector of	a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise	which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group	8140.298999919682
9382. as you can see	in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is	vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises h so	the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   now when	henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no 1	the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting	him on four complete push-pull super-sets no 2	8451.13698562429
9383. super-set	no 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done	with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches	2176.516296986378
9384. the push	exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done	with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of	the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation	5178.049279266454
9385. you need the	barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs h the dumbbell	variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs	2746.9939044555945
9386. the pull exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell	bent-arm pullover	750.9413819959905
9387. the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise	because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation		1453.0099797443368
9388. in the third push-pull super-set the push	exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars while the pull	exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms	4283.150413170368
9389. the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage	stretcher ever invented! this is true if a very wide grip	is used and is	achieved	2742.759920602617
9390. by this time henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area	is pumped-up to almost bursting point and claude takes time to	do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work	2724.2695795609043
9391. he has henri do	from four to six sets of the incline bench press	1416.981701280054
9392. this gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow	dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the	serratus and lats	2468.0650750965806
9393. this is the kind of chest that invariably	wins contests h that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks	of the great champions	2832.6239599799433
9394. so with four complete push-pull	super-sets no 1 four of no 2 four of no 3 and four to	six sets of the incline bench press you can see that henri de courcy	has had a terrific mass-building muscle-shaping torso-defining	workout that cannot be improved upon	4696.986599350983
9395. physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone h	rarer still is a mr america or mr universe of true herculean	build	3484.3383301629847
9396. the aspects of physical development that catch the judges'	eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry	and that hallmark of the true champion- superior definition	of the muscles	3221.22323234394
9397. now good definition is one thing that all of us can	acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workouts	2357.7241541135686
9398. but contest definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every	muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's	chisel- is something quite different	2988.1595948467375
9399. this comes not alone	from high-set high-rep training but from certain definition-specialization	exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge	of exactly what works best for him	4668.495049610539
9400. often these exercises	work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others	791.0439509321461
9401. because they are minority exercises and have but a limited	appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten	3045.8093968169233
9402. only	when the newest mr america or mr universe rediscovers	them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and	once again see how effective they really are	3227.645061791033
9403. the exercise i	shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle	definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the one	leg lunge	4482.408433405462
9404. definition of the thighs at the uppermost	part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which	is easily understandable	3040.146845255899
9405. the one leg lunge is a and	all lifters practice this in their regular workouts	1099.6894004673436
9406. but for	purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular	squatting leg curling leg extensor programs- a heavy weight is	not needed	3477.968920358677
9407. indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater	more extensive split can be performed	1261.9018371105062
9408. it places terrific tension on	the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition	1097.3244078018959
9409. it	improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps	to make squats more easily and more correctly performed	2817.101102168017
9410. it	increases flexibility of the legs	43.5822748844126
9411. it speeds muscle growth	and power development even for the bodybuilder because	each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated	effort to be focused on each	4844.495608512518
9412. you'll need your weider	power stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's	done:  place your power stands in position and adjust their	height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders	when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean	4954.086665130634
9413. place	a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar	; extend your feet forward and	backward until you are in a deep leg split	2362.4161154432077
9414. now raise the weight	by leg without moving your	feet	373.10679018586757
9415. when the front knee is straight and allow it	to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the	sides of the power stands	4489.14257690314
9416. after you have taken a breather	the position of your legs so that the thigh	of the and the	thigh now to the and perform the same movement	in the same manner	3447.2020761723943
9417. that's the one-leg lunge in a nutshell	139.93420970118206
9418. you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you	make your first	experiments h just for safety	2032.1995152461936
9419. you should also begin	this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed	to it balance-wise	2373.9358973086764
9420. oh you'll wobble and weave quite a bit	at first	375.529876018745
9421. before your first training experiment	has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it	you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!	although i suggested that you hold the bar at the of	the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments	with the bar held in of the neck	8214.253539219511
9422. squat-style lifters and	leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those	variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the	and	2467.8633905461256
9423. the most beautiful bed of pansies i've seen was in a south	dakota yard on a sizzling day	2353.1318528231654
9424. pansies are supposed to like it	cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring	sun	1886.7883044588852
9425. i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce	such beauties in that weather	2343.821024946067
9426. he seemed puzzled by my question	43.23416353654167
9427. i just love them he said	64.88850625105283
9428. the more i talked with him	the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous	blooming	1879.5375034430683
9429. of course his love was expressed in intelligent care	393.10615497263973
9430. he planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist	641.0438194988484
9431. these specialists i learned have done a great deal of work to	improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers	3713.2074134228433
9432. their	seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the	unimproved strains	943.8985602115694
9433. i asked him if he took seeds from his own	plants	759.6045360607164
9434. occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted	more of he did; but pansy seeds he told me soon run down	2311.7671778435915
9435. it's	best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them	1644.3997091751419
9436. his soil was nothing special just prairie land but	he had harrowed in compost until it was loose spongy and brown-black	2031.6415780947827
9437. i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the	right texture tilth and body	2360.3322564014024
9438. it isn't easy to describe it but every	gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil	1409.5605708340852
9439. nothing	is easier to grow from seed than pansies	391.11728111714103
9440. they germinate quickly the	tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily	946.7975690999483
9441. it doesn't	really matter which month of the year you sow them but they germinate	best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed	by cool in the same 24 hours	5470.577558760779
9442. i like to make a seedbed	right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold	frames	1730.1408913099106
9443. pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things	rugged with only moderate protection on the coldest days	2579.2337349140676
9444. if you	do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate	935.2542182921549
9445. for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to	encourage rooting	1886.2009000675403
9446. i dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them	down with a fog spray	1416.9471820531921
9447. then i cover the sowing with a board	251.95325098035892
9448. this	keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds	505.589474288
9449. ants carry away	the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby	1879.7111284577445
9450. when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board	502.82318504404867
9451. a	light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft	during these early days of growth	2826.8521215086976
9452. i like sawdust for this or hay	94.40948645899915
9453. when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants it's	time to set them out where they are to remain	3456.7311897677973
9454. every time you transplant	a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller	789.109684963162
9455. the moral is:	don't transplant it any oftener than you must	752.0132560256048
9456. as soon as they	are large enough to move i put mine 9 inches apart where they are	to bloom	1869.8272040669904
9457. i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed	bone meal into each hole with the plant	2605.819036242508
9458. that encourages rooting and	the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers	1268.034962076134
9459. i doubt if it is possible to overfeed	them	388.99062760692897
9460. i spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that	decayed manure spread over the bed is fine	1576.214333481388
9461. one year i simply set the	plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had	been added and i had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my	neighbors' experience	5931.165201604205
9462. in addition to the rich soil they benefit by	feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak	tea	2311.545829874666
9463. as a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water	to half the strength in the directions may be used	2803.980805842327
9464. we put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use	a heavy one	1100.64211677404
9465. three inches of porous material will do a good job of	keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool	2840.996904716107
9466. when winter comes	be ready with additional mulch	166.37434329179126
9467. i like hay for this and apply it	so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost	3283.9858879737426
9468. that	keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate	freezing and thawing	1263.1675849127828
9469. don't miss the pansies that appear	from time to time through the winter	1175.376594133731
9470. whenever there is a thaw or	a few sunny days you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or	two	2027.9761312662272
9471. if those aren't enough for you why not grow some just for winter	blooming	1414.3251837344255
9472. the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february	during a particularly cold winter	1093.5975274631717
9473. i started the seed in a flat	in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame	2576.3582833709106
9474. the plants	took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a mat of straw over	the glass to protect them	2025.932938261672
9475. in response to the lengthening days of february	they budded then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers	1880.5703895430083
9476. that	cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a	border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it	2976.6063067869172
9477. like	strawberries in december pansies are far more exciting in february	than in may	1402.333906738992
9478. try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold	and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it	2598.2366393136695
9479. the day will come in midsummer when you find your plants becoming	leggy running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms	3261.291102368275
9480. try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby	pin to hold it there	1420.6822252418071
9481. pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and	each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little	plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season	5016.886815622069
9482. as soon as an experimental	tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from	the mother plant	1886.7454408133278
9483. a second and also good practice is to shear	off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each	branch	4135.308405478329
9484. these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time	and will behave just as they did in early spring	1877.655316507175
9485. i like to shear half	my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the	second half is getting started on its new round of blooming	4803.758063200422
9486. probably	no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to	let the blossoms go to seed	2172.96196659752
9487. nature's aim different from ours is	to provide for the coming generation	968.7074345147117
9488. that done her work is accomplished	and she ignores the plant	506.679448961034
9489. here is a word of advice when	you go shopping for your pansy seeds	1411.0055304996474
9490. go to a reputable grower preferably	a pansy specialist	259.9485318146637
9491. it is no harder to raise big healthy blooming	plants than weak sickly little things; in fact it is easier	2823.160384707766
9492. but	you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow	641.7761121563851
9493. many	people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period	of growth and bloom is over	2580.572473252301
9494. if the plants are cared	for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific	than the first	1893.531545098219
9495. would you like to grow exhibition pansies	140.0253515248125
9496. remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest	with the largest buds	1267.7287028827513
9497. the flowers will be huge	22.238812802910346
9498. they stick to their principles insist upon their	due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it	1727.0256240534447
9499. treat	them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except	the frigid ones	2129.8178589474187
9500. give them food some shade mulch water and more	food and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty	1419.5981605512902
9501. a salad with	greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition	to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special	4099.680020196711
9502. this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past	thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible	to ship avocado anywhere in the united states	2981.3412611259796
9503. it has a great	many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part	of your diet yet you really should	3701.233080298498
9504. you will find that avocado	is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted	934.6157975024411
9505. it is roughly shaped	like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers	a meaty melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe	bartlett pear but oily	5334.766640153209
9506. the avocado should have a give to it	as you hold it when it is ripe	1261.2178553622437
9507. the flavor is neither sweet like	a pear nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland nut-like	2827.242793681135
9508. it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not	because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in	the light of our experience with other fruits	3645.540277335117
9509. sometimes it takes several	eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste	that has made it such a favorite throughout the world	3694.1223239283086
9510. once you become	an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with	eager anticipation	1580.9842313593049
9511. today	refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible	to any place in the world	1878.9854182889903
9512. the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree	but it is still firm at this point	1409.0467714595172
9513. it is brought to packing houses	cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective	excelsior	2582.912322635246
9514. the fruit is then cooled to 42`f a temperature at which	it lapses into a sort of dormant state	1724.6551110206929
9515. this cooling does not change	the avocado in any way it just delays the natural softening of	the fruit until a grovelike temperature is restored	3879.6562988466226
9516. this happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen	376.3654442691325
9517. one	of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require	processing of any kind	2345.9113133181554
9518. there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing	needed	264.6948095489177
9519. if the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay	its ripening until needed	1410.5555465387692
9520. and unlike other fruits one cannot eat	the skin of the avocado	643.6377337943597
9521. it is thick much like an egg plant's skin	so that poison sprays if they are used present no hazard to the	consumer	3484.653022110792
9522. good taste and	versatility	plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend	the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were	limited	2975.067040962115
9523. avocados however are very rich in nutrients	141.1350147811459
9524. their main	asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining	the good health of the circulatory system	2029.1654764747746
9525. aside from this	the average portion contains some protein an appreciable amount of vitamins	a and c- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement	and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement	5512.307220548593
9526. the	b vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin	373.9265472027729
9527. calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts	and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts	3027.7628796818567
9528. none of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration	storage	638.364424331704
9529. dr wilson c grant of the veterans'	administration hospital coral gables florida and the university	of miami school of medicine set out to discover if avocados	because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce	the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients	6898.657166140049
9530. the study comprised	16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to 72	790.8444821060056
9531. they were put	on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol	level of their blood	2604.092696930141
9532. then they were given 12 to 1-12 avocados	per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption	1883.1544163219528
9533. five four three two one fire! the tremendous energy	released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than	it can be heard	3890.118479276055
9534. the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the	pit of your stomach	640.2699117815922
9535. never before has the introduction of a weapon	caused so much apprehension and fear	1419.5940746863355
9536. nuclear weapons are fearsome	but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless	swiftness which is much more terrifying	2035.6645593274563
9537. a great many writers	are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker	would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear	rockets	4107.647681026257
9538. it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that	an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously	destroy his opponent's cities and people	2988.6611835481026
9539. with a nation defenseless	before it why would the attacker spare the victim's people	1416.6353472146607
9540. wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical	act of complete subjugation	1095.7659326398978
9541. the nation would be utterly devastated	65.5761438461833
9542. the will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken	936.2937650792226
9543. nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction	in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means	to destroy itself in minutes	4306.250631421297
9544. at this point it should be painfully obvious	that cities being soft and the people within them are ideally	suited to destruction by nuclear weapons	2598.330829703479
9545. however because	this vulnerability is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side	to destroy the opponent's cities at least so long as the opponent	has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal	5493.243627551351
9546. it should be appallingly	apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic	784.5474137340648
9547. icbms have given us a capability which could be used in	two different ways	1414.4545662400983
9548. they could be used to attack a nation's people		or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military	force	2186.6902827407853
9549. if our national interest lies in being able to	fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must	take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles	4981.710243775968
9550. we must	determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves	642.3719551986629
9551. we must make	certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job	to the missile	2365.630465853678
9552. missiles are very valuable weapons but they	also have their too little known limitations	938.2822412344465
9553. because of a missile's	ballistic trajectory the location of a fixed target must be	known quite accurately	2126.8637207937445
9554. placing missiles in submarines on barges railroads	highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with	passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range	ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying	a mobile or moving target with such weapons	4529.374457233921
9555. one must first detect	a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of	destruction select the missile to be fired against the target	compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for	firing	5893.873616182336
9556. even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously	the icbm still has a time of flight to the target	of about 30 minutes	2461.0131220100657
9557. therefore if the target can significantly change	its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of	having destroyed it is drastically lowered	3663.881207217016
9558. because of this	it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic	missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile	defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability	3542.45553858098
9559. in order to destroy the enemy's mobile moving or imprecisely	located strategic forces we must have a hunter-killer capability	in addition to our missiles	3699.409669299719
9560. until this hunter-killer operation	can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only	means available to us	1879.7470608363196
9561. it seems reasonable that if general	nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's	citizens to cinders we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance	aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and	destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us	7522.969794795854
9562. let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm	force	641.2260163333873
9563. it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52	or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based	missiles	2833.2743685485702
9564. if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton	nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which	may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would	seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small	nuclear weapons	4547.860533542255
9565. an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons	could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains	operating within a specified geographic area of russia- provided that	we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia's air defenses	before our bombers got there	7139.046711995053
9566. the aircraft could be used to destroy	other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as	the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by	missile	3222.1881629288546
9567. why then aren't we planning a larger more important	role for manned military aircraft	1409.0804223196087
9568. is there any other way to do	the job	261.69589898376233
9569. survivability of our strategic forces	mobile and hardened minuteman hardened atlas and titan and airborne	means that it will take some time perhaps weeks to destroy	a strategic force	4636.277783256834
9570. war under these circumstances cannot be one	massive exchange of nuclear devastation	645.5871131158958
9571. forces will survive a surprise	attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration	to the conflict	2382.1154406585033
9572. the forces which survive the initial	attack	must be found and destroyed	638.5551448970457
9573. even mobile forces must be found and	destroyed	249.14513673765913
9574. but how does one go about the job of finding and destroying	mobile forces	950.7720649569399
9575. they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction	by ballistic missile	557.6871294019853
9576. some day many years in the future true	spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets	1571.0363629516612
9577. but until	we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer	problem is manned aircraft	1897.5890325286096
9578. however the aircraft which we have	today are tied to large soft airfields	786.2444057957894
9579. nuclear rockets can	destroy airfields with ease	141.2705459726144
9580. here then is our problem: aircraft are	vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions	which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield	on which the aircraft is completely dependent is doomed by the missile	4393.483561538416
9581. this makes today's aircraft a one-shot or one mission weapon	571.7429307413055
9582. aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once	503.7660116781294
9583. this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft	in favor of the missile	2595.30848447663
9584. but remember this- it isn't the aircraft	which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets it is the airfield	1424.3979747940134
9585. eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you	have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic	missiles	2591.0038859118067
9586. there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or	eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:    put	aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground	2984.0755613357287
9587. build long-range aircraft which can take off from small	airfields with runways	962.6580781926907
9588. if we could use all the small airfields	we have in this country we could disperse our strategic aircraft	by a factor of 10 or more	2734.69825566492
9589. use nuclear propulsions to keep	our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their	useful life	2594.5035467787775
9590. using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines	develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing long-range	military aircraft	646.8893060387537
9591. we have the technology today with which to	build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 psi	2349.2507707586187
9592. we	could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters	641.3956588457318
9593. large	long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability	to take off from 3000-foot runways but they would require more powerful	engines than we have today	4484.99997303308
9594. there is little enthusiasm for spending	money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief	that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile	2853.2720632123874
9595. this	same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted	in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft	3283.8655795327372
9596. one seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for	the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine	1890.616724928858
9597. if	for some reason such as economy we are not going to develop aircraft	nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency then we should	turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio	of 12 or 15 to one	6581.17205286402
9598. with powerplants such as these vertical takeoff	and landing combat aircraft could be built	949.0387645432535
9599. for example a 12-to-one	engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter	751.8912576957026
9600. with a 15-to-one	engine a supersonic aircraft weighing 300000 pounds could rise	vertically	792.0562048431573
9601. the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to	develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a	billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft	are obsolete	5770.288394903053
9602. when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields	they are no longer vulnerable to icbms	1098.2690891286124
9603. if our sac	bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and	because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability	to strike at russia again and again and again those bombers would	unquestionably assure our military dominance	6457.30907514115
9604. we would have	the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it	were fixed or mobile	1732.6146308039129
9605. with such a force of manned bombers we could bring	enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be	selective and extremely discriminating	4122.183733799788
9606. no need to kill an entire city	and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance	to selectively disarm the enemy's military force	2599.8749659211653
9607. our first	necessity at the very outset of war is post-attack reconnaissance	958.5424331220945
9608. in a few years we will have samos		79.47132536944319
9609. but in the case of moving targets and targets which	have limited mobility what will their location be when it is time to	destroy them	3879.702198978755
9610. what targets have we successfully knocked out	93.37905007484176
9611. a	ballistic missile cannot today tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful	1186.3427782882663
9612. what targets still remain to be hit	92.91296394750641
9613. these crucial questions	must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance	389.4717367831989
9614. samos will	be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark	1096.667721393404
9615. even if this is some day possible there remains the 30-minute time	of flight of a missile to its overseas target	3039.6279821319677
9616. if the target can change	its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in	the air on its way the probability of the missile destroying the target	is drastically reduced	3438.884983230768
9617. pre-attack reconnaissance is vital	but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate	the war favorably	1880.6007528653722
9618. it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather	that post-attack reconnaissance	785.6103651286079
9619. it could operate under the clouds	and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night	1641.7511171336482
9620. it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately	destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile	to come all the way from the united states with the chance that	the target if it were mobile would be gone	4677.319210427123
9621. a large aircraft	such as the b-52 or b-70 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small	nuclear weapons	2375.6964761860436
9622. few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive	power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 feet	1564.5811210449206
9623. or	put	another way the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed	by placing a one-kiloton warhead	within 100 to 200 feet of the target!	it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large	yield nuclear weapons	6671.604286377398
9624. today we have side-looking radar which	has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual	buildings runways taxi-ways separate spans of bridges etc	2602.138036626621
9625. with these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy	military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage	to urban areas	3475.730598471103
9626. if we fail to develop the means to hunt down	and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision	and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace	our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening	4391.93017958588
9627. the lyric beauties of schubert's trout quintet-	its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source	of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners	3903.420233093002
9628. but for students of	musical forms and would-be classifiers the work presents its problems	938.5706687385173
9629. since it requires only five players it would seem to fall into the	category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass an instrument	generally regarded as symphonic	4830.360285659537
9630. moreover the piece is written	in five movements rather than the conventional four of most quintets	and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor	2744.640858799655
9631. the	many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize	the dual nature of its writing	2121.280377593129
9632. some renditions are of symphonic dimensions	with the contrabass given free rein	643.142127268927
9633. other interpretations present	the music as an essentially intimate creation	564.977007305904
9634. in these readings	the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background or it	is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in	a china shop	3218.289255479883
9635. recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches	when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer	than ten different performances	4287.673466872564
9636. the occasion for this marathon:	angel's long-awaited reissue in its great recordings of the	century series of the schnabel-pro arte version	2030.6254446338007
9637. let me say at	the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as	it did on the first	3271.0689795361404
9638. whether considered alone or in relation	to other editions colh 40 is a document of prime importance	1415.2116721805007
9639. artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart	players of all time and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable	3252.3567049690764
9640. but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great	performer and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to	are by schnabel pupils	also sheds light on the master's pedagogical	skills	3952.3060730976454
9641. certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian	renditions most notably the schnabel trill		958.3374665672575
9642. but the most impressive testimony to schnabel's distinction	as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each	student's approach as distinctly his own	2616.128270756789
9643. schnabel's emphasis	on structural clarity his innate rhythmic vibrancy and impetuous	intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one	3284.3863543903926
9644. yet no	detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a	result the playing here has humor delicacy and radiant humanity	2620.4817896936274
9645. this	is a serious-minded interpretation but it is never strait-laced	564.4711013525739
9646. and	although schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement it is meticulously	faithful to schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications	1578.0858296834444
9647. the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands	a search for superlatives	1654.4231917713091
9648. about the pro arte's contribution	i am less happy	261.99088011741685
9649. i for one rather regret that schnabel didn't	collaborate with the budapest quartet whose rugged athletic	playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook	than the style of the belgian group	5481.875285325694
9650. from a technical standpoint	the string playing is good but the pro arte people fail to enter	into the spirit of things here	2323.445313569676
9651. the violinist in particular is very	indulgent with swoops and slides and his tone is pinched and edgy	2371.9347040183375
9652. the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone	but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very	quiet	2188.875944669219
9653. there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation	in the forellen movement and i suspect that this is	due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original sps	4975.841688666851
9654. turning to the more modern versions curzon's offers	the most sophisticated keyboard work	793.7254559651223
9655. every detail in his interpretation	has been beautifully thought out and of these i would especially	cite the delicious la^ndler touch the pianist brings to the fifth	variation	and the gossamer shading throughout	5365.547223559992
9656. some of curzon's	playing strikes me as finicky however	260.5590408149923
9657. why for example does he favor	two tempos rather than one for the third movement	1653.6807854986287
9658. the assisting	musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise	but their contribution is rustic and appealing	1733.005585642059
9659. to the double bass playing of johann krumpp: his scrawny	the glazer-fine arts edition is a model of lucidity	and organization	3029.671465799344
9660. it is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble	effort	167.59028355792182
9661. but having lived with the disc for some time now i find	the performance less exciting than either schnabel's or fleisher's	and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon's	5020.457485426914
9662. aeschbacher's work is very much akin to schnabel's but the sound	on his decca disc is dated and you will have a hard time locating	a copy of it	3115.49079189235
9663. the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet	and victor babin-festival quartet editions	give us superlative string playing crippled	by unimaginative piano playing	2599.657205227226
9664. badura-skoda-vienna	konzerthaus and demus-schubert quartet	are both warm-toned pleasantly lyrical	but rather slack and tensionless	1104.0475916539
9665. helmut roloff playing with a group	of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble gives a sturdy reading in	much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists	4288.190018587293
9666. telefunken	has accorded him beautiful sound and this bargain-priced disc	is worthy of consideration	943.4949737470673
9667. returning once again	to the schnabel reissue i am beguiled anew by the magnificence	of this pianist's musical penetration	2578.116376769518
9668. here is truly a great recording	of the century and its greatness is by no means diminished	by the fact that it is not quite perfect	2733.532568042042
9669. this recording surely belongs	in everyone's collection	140.04337547181103
9670. must records always sound like records	43.80310346652689
9671. from the beginning	of commercial recording new discs purported to be indistinguishable	from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation	3268.802196061889
9672. seen	in perspective many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones	944.3366652725365
9673. although lacking absolute verisimilitude they supply the	ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation	of the original	2824.7227778912884
9674. on the basis of what they give us we can know how the	young caruso sang appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal	under karl muck's baton or sense the type of ensemble toscanini	created in his years with the new york philharmonic	4381.421771125593
9675. since	the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago	the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold	2826.2078051625554
9676. in many	cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational	effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning	as the gap between sound and substance became clearer	3346.5955046128415
9677. other	innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing	to acquire in time the status of classics	2341.4223784977285
9678. if we return to them today	we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them	still pleasing	1715.889979293211
9679. records sound like records because they provide	a different sort of experience than live music	1642.7592417281953
9680. this difference is	made up of many factors	167.50980988240715
9681. some of them are obvious such as the fact	that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior	in different types of environments and social settings	4625.713012101883
9682. sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something	from the technical standpoint	records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey	the true color texture complexity range intensity pulse and pitch	of the original	4460.611198115482
9683. any alteration of one of these factors is distortion	although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced	that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests	5167.586645838923
9684. yet it is the accumulation of distortion the fitting together of	fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness	that makes records sound like records	2979.277932152715
9685. the sound may be good;	but if you know the real thing you know that what you are hearing	is only a clever imitation	3727.2492029836785
9686. command's new brahms second is	a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather	than a copy of one	2476.7231677867367
9687. like the recent scheherazade from london	it is successful because emphasis	has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than	on creating sensational effects	4084.047509827149
9688. because of this only those with	truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the	engineers' triumph	2036.215910787331
9689. the easiest way to describe this release	is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg	performance with minimal alteration of its musical values	4084.5857980431365
9690. the engineering	as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness	260.8737099546964
9691. the effect of	the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis	exactly what you would expect from a live performance	3517.2239750863323
9692. this absence of	peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity but	it eliminates listener fatigue	1570.5101564248562
9693. a contributing factor is the perspective	the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained	1190.61895368317
9694. the orchestra	is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes valve	clicks and other noises incidental to playing	2175.4982178657506
9695. yet you feel the orchestra	is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm	presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically	perfect hall	4853.8480424273685
9696. command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation	165.838583385949
9697. the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its	full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer	3282.855731897815
9698. the	timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance	372.17671885001266
9699. all of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked	authority and musical distinction	1891.0500090148369
9700. for me it has more of both elements	than the majority of its competitors	946.2493162247969
9701. steinberg seems to have gone	directly back to the score discounting tradition and has built his	performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly	what brahms set down on paper	5359.537231981007
9702. those accustomed to broader	more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react	strongly when they hear this one	2028.017524795343
9703. without losing the distinctive undertow	of brahmsian rhythm the pacing is firm and the over-all performance	has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect	4275.7846684582055
9704. the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is	taken literally and may shock you as the real allegro con spirito	of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet	3856.294660322628
9705. in the end however	the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way	it sings	2355.9252361250965
9706. steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element	which must dominate in this score and he manages at times to create	the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song	3438.752250061404
9707. the	engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result	758.2750587606388
9708. too	many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody	and its accompaniment	1417.9355492730813
9709. the command technique invites you to listen	to the depth of the orchestration	1185.4927873754664
9710. your ear takes you into the ensemble	and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously	were apparent only in the score	2453.7258339775576
9711. it is this sort of experience	that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance	for the home music listener	3255.401660971095
9712. the first substantially complete stereo giselle	of its scope since feyer's four-sided lp edition of 1958 for	this set is i'm afraid likely to provide more horrid fascination	than enjoyment	3221.7482613882066
9713. the already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve	music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts	between ultravehement brute power and chilly if suave sentimentality	3899.931884418072
9714. and in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic	impact and earsplitting brilliance the recording sounds as though	it had been doctored for super-high fidelity	2739.5429060574015
9715. the home listener	is overpowered all right but the experience is a far from pleasant	one	1899.1693202902381
9716. as with the penultimate giselle release	i find the cleaner less razor-edged	monophonic	version for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness the more	aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects	in my sd copies	4024.760887252526
9717. at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden	new york on the second day the finals of the junior class	brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class	5475.262796182844
9718. the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far	south as kentucky	1266.5683155363754
9719. this year several entries from canada were entered	which made the junior class international	1403.3656736302196
9720. forty-six of	the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present	494.3062397280984
9721. it was interesting	to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other	classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class	4445.278022763337
9722. as has been the custom for the past several years john cross	jr bench show chmn of westminster arranged for the juniors'	meeting before the class and invited two speakers from the dog	world to address them	3966.8853049054183

9730. take	away your attitude said mrs long and what have you left	960.3641391047356
9731. either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign	that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! or a	bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe	the way you look or the date you have after the class or you are just	doing this to please the parents	5519.399117625105
9732. the reason you are in	the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most	attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can	produce	5463.064509747079
9733. aids sounds more like a pony club or horsemanship classes-	riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   your	aids are your attitude which comes through your voice your hands	and legs- voice to encourage discourage or whatever the need may	be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of	speed	5390.294678908724
9734. without right attitude the other aids just do not work right	760.2915516627144

9740. he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should	take a more active part in encouraging the junior division!	in closing mr barcus also wished all the juniors	luck in their class	5337.764035472362
9741. instead of 3 am	in the past the juniors class at westminster was held at 4:45	pm	1413.0303227536112

9743. from there on each junior was going to be judged individually	498.84617709294736

9779. some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew	nothing of what was required of a junior's ability to show a dog	2442.7340712409614
9780. to	overcome this unfair judging the akc requires that a licensed	handler be present to judge the class	2355.035394960613

9799. there	are more than 8000000 recreational boats in use in the united states	with almost 10000000 the prediction for within the next decade	2321.308431846671

9804. but during the	last several years boats were launched in areas where a short time	ago the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for	livestock	4836.033994683144
9805. developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources	control program of the government vast man-made bodies of water represent	a kind of glorious fringe benefit providing boating and fishing	havens all over the country	3647.967936219058

9813. today the boat on its trailer is brought to the gear and	loaded at the door	1258.0843777326177

9832. you pay your money and you take your choice	391.9985838100765
9833. american technology	in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful	interest in american boating	1418.981437343598
9834. i wonder if anyone ever bothered	to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors americans	excel over any country in the world in the long run	4987.410928107372
9835. russia	whose technology is not quite primitive is still in the dark ages	when it comes to improving the outboard motor for instance	2317.2023853181636
9836. now	here is truly a marvel	66.0238153870915
9837. the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal	range of one to 80 horsepower unheard of a few years ago for a two	cycle engine in quantity production	2982.0139572172125

9844. terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down	payments run about the same as for automobiles	3072.3109072481425
9845. of course individual	financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning	power credit rating and local bank policy	1890.8273771170163
9846. outboard motors	insurance and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as	boats	1885.7482349607465
9847. terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those	for home appliances	785.8142039707164
9848. when the automobile was in its embryonic	stage such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit	understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about	the only rule governing where when and how fast a car could go	6693.587071447046

9853. however there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating	375.7226558780536

9862. it is always wise to consult your marine dealer local yacht	or boat club secretary or local law enforcement officers if you are	not positive what the regulations are	4680.613011818645
9863. ignorance of the law is no better	excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common	sense can lead to just as much tragedy	3104.6290397008643
9864. hand in hand with	the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed	safety program	1906.530731253709
9865. foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the	rapid growth of the sport the industry has been supporting an intense	coordinated educational program with great success since 1947	2995.2427422898936

9871. a new waterfront site for the bureau	is now being built at atlantic city new jersey to provide the	most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the	sport safe	3573.278474322299
9872. in addition to these activities the naebm	with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue new york city as well	as other associations and individual manufacturers provide and distribute	films booklets and public services in regard to proper boat handling	and safety afloat	6470.466759189337
9873. it is important to note the work of	the united states power squadrons and the us coast guard	auxiliary	1730.4774804891742
9874. each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in	seamanship piloting and small boat handling	1892.0950357586892
9875. these are not governmentally	subsidized organizations	43.12960506792338
9876. this year over 100000 persons will	receive this free instruction	563.0734138131149
9877. as america on wheels was responsible	for an industry of motor courts motels and drive-in establishments	where you can dine see a movie shop or make a bank deposit	the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries	designed especially to accommodate them	4462.319553877244
9878. instead of motels for	the boatman there are marinas	392.6563003869575
9879. the word marina was coined by	naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational	boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative	comfort	2978.047689145321
9880. currently marina is used to indicate a municipal or	commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome	or all of the following available: gasoline fresh water electricity	telephone service ice repair facilities restaurants sleeping	accommodations a general store and a grocery store	6941.376015958536
9881. yachtel	a relatively new word indicates a waterfront type of hotel where	a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises	as well as other services	2998.0725234627334
9882. boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel	140.65010971815266
9883. it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically	to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as	outboards	2591.0053691781036
9884. regardless of nomenclature yachtels and boatels are marinas	251.28821715015297
9885. boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities	may rightfully be called marinas	938.6086658704578
9886. a recent survey disclosed there	are about 4000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and	boatyards in the united states the majority of which are equipped	to handle outboard boats	4645.772079660166
9887. the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical	puzzle but once understood the principles can be applied to	any track and signal arrangement	2847.7918225086487
9888. in the frame are two sets of bars	which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous	moves	3048.5167031287087
9889. the main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet	is connected to each lever	1259.4026572654047
9890. if the lever is pulled to clear a signal	or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at	the same time	3706.882267260361
9891. close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking	bars	502.58891553804096
9892. these can also move a short distance but at right angles	to the tappets	1413.8043074994123
9893. the number of locking bars required depends on how many	false moves must be prevented	1096.5011249226504
9894. in the sides of the tappets	are notches with sloping sides and connection between the tappets and	locking bars consist of cams called dogs	3682.0075462732784
9895. two or more dogs are	mounted on each locking bar	376.87075476104616
9896. these slide into and out of the notches	in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and unlocking them	2827.814569057956
9897. here's how the scheme works: suppose the operator pulls	the lever to clear a particular signal	1253.7612247865413
9898. this also pulls the tappet connected	to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches	to the side thus moving one or more locking bars	4495.69308387697
9899. the dogs on the	other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other	tappets	1574.362008417044
9900. by this scheme pulling one signal to clear locks all the	other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal	is again restored to normal	4472.325922945285
9901. interlocking signals are normally	at stop or red position and a lever must be pulled to clear	the signal	1725.9549705739246
9902. this is not necessarily to green however for in	some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it	into the plant	4097.283015843209
9903. there are other basic rules	14.802397091639824
9904. a turnout	may have two levers one to actually move the switch points the other	to lock the points	2604.1006871278173
9905. a signal cannot be cleared until all the related	turnouts are properly thrown and locked	1099.954730801489
9906. such locks are nearly	always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic	1187.2641600028023
9907. the	lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that	a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point	2603.0922251035126
9908. if the points aren't	thrown all the way the turnout cannot be locked and in turn	the signal cannot be cleared	3043.4691511249875
9909. generally these locks on turnouts are	called facing point locks	374.23461026547164
9910. figs 1-6 show typical arrangements	of track and signals	391.8602263785334
9911. each diagram is accompanied by a dog	chart a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular	lever will lock if pulled	2598.0113113324633
9912. the lines connecting the wedge-shaped	dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars	2121.658345226989
9913. by studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several	other details	371.95913025180056
9914. derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide	the wheels off the rails if a train passes a stop signal- are	used in many instances	3702.5203700362363
9915. home signals have two blades	14.826252383390345
9916. the blacked-in	blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move	966.9091559854512
9917. as	an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal	is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located	beyond the limits of the interlocking plant	3222.825180858475
9918. in some low-speed situations	the distant signal is fixed at caution	756.2575439297015
9919. in other instances where	there is no automatic block signaling the distant has only green	and yellow aspects	1577.4392788253883
9920. so much for the prototype	22.23219339190524
9921. the interlocking	frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then	installed on paul larson's railroad follows the fig 1 scheme	and is shown beginning in fig 7 page 65 and in the photos	3769.1820072889504
9922. here's	how it can be built	65.1241412303241
9923. the sizes of pieces needed	for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig 7 most	of the bars being 18'' brass in 14'' and 12'' widths	3112.9998788334174
9924. you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers	and locks as you wish	2610.2162000965313
9925. our instructions assume you are building	this particular frame which is for a junction	943.3407633940797
9926. when cutting	the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or sanding	disk	2125.328163794601
9927. start with the right-hand piece b f soldering	it to the lower piece a of the same material but 12''	long	2026.8541674198154
9928. let exactly 1'' of a extend beyond b and	use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees	2821.2402376793543
9929. now	lay 12 pieces of f cut 5-34'' long side by side but separated	by 12 pieces of the same material 12'' sq	2314.5583312646304
9930. this gives you the	spacing for locating the left-hand piece b	761.2478998849957
9931. compress the assembly	when you make the mark to show the location for b	944.3469185419339
9932. solder	this second b to a at right angles	393.8174120083636
9933. there	should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be	1'' from an end of the long piece	2040.307959778312
9934. cap this assembly	with a f bar	141.1187662229232
9935. tack-solder all the 12''	sq pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members	646.1966637571549
9936. these will be drilled	and tapped later on	249.25210449170322
9937. now cut five f locking bar spacers		43.488065760399934
9938. position these using six intermediate temporary	f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar a	1658.9338325755773
9939. solder	it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame	503.1311584623709
9940. now place 12 pieces	12'' sq on this edge as we did before and space them with	the 5-34'' long tappets as they are called	3894.231009153134
9941. cap with a f	bar and tack-solder in place	262.20971062289516

9944. mark and center-punch all the holes required	for screws to hold this assembly together	1407.206181578901
9945. placement	of these holes is not critical but they should be located so that	the centers are about 18'' from any edge	2182.2401673532377
9946. drill all no 50 and	counter-drill all except the a pieces size 43	1190.205838852168
9947. tap the a	pieces 2-56	14.898377577266325
9948. now unsolder and disassemble the frame	except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-34'' bars	which are soldered together	3049.543971894893
9949. either lay	the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters	so they may be replaced in their proper positions	2450.5439103963495
9950. dress all surfaces	with a file cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs	1184.693972669474
9951. drill 20 no 47 holes in the upper piece a as shown in	fig 7	1104.8083497209705
9952. tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later	on	561.2139547071287
9953. note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts	500.91519687556286
9954. now reassemble the frame using f roundhead steel screws and nuts	754.5040455484141
9955. put the 12 tappets and some f locking bar spacers in the frame to	help align all the components before you tighten the screws	2471.527189005338
9956. be sure	the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 12'' sq spacer	1182.5993432143323
9957. as	an anchor for the spring lock insert a f bar in the lower left corner	of the frame as shown in fig 7	2470.374744494091
9958. drill a no 43 hole through	the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw	1894.1214548421983
9959. drill two no 50	holes one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly	above it and tap 2-56	2183.4607340604534
9960. number all the tappet bars before removing them	so they can be replaced in the same slots	2112.1628575633254
9961. remove all other loose	pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth	940.6264424202916
9962. cut five pieces	of f brass bar stock 3-34'' long	556.635964860375
9963. these are supporting members	for the short locking bars	261.7485407179289
9964. locate their positions in fig 7 and	drill no 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame	2355.7492007437427
9965. cut off	excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut	786.8863445651584
9966. drill	four no 19 and four no 28 holes in the 12'' long a	pieces	1657.604227862616
9967. locate the position from fig 7	43.967223968723694
9968. bars	draw-file no 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective	slot and square the ends	2125.4653743940235
9969. break the end corners with a slight 45 degree	chamfer	377.6191525303732
9970. drill a no 50 hole 1-14'' from one end and tap	2-56	963.9177025582092
9971. put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole cut	off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar	2186.7722483104494
9972. to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame	and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge	3492.5568193137274
9973. scribe a line	across the bar on the other end of the tappet 14'' plus half the	diameter of the 2-56 screw head away from the frame	edge	2987.7366806416385
9974. total distance is about 2164''	22.32987192286973
9975. tend to make this dimension	slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly	14'' tappet movement	1888.6165402186816
9976. drill a no 50 hole tap 2-56 and insert	a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end	2827.8615876588765
9977. drill a no	47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in	figs	7 and 8	1575.961553309278
9978. repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet	bars	957.722443948712
9979. to each tappet except 6 and 8 solder a f piece of	brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs 6 and 8	2607.2336156169035
9980. these	will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts	566.2595554924592
9981. fitting	the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job	since stop screws tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced	many times	2989.313786118648
9982. as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become	a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before	the part you are working on is accessible	4839.802327317962
9983. a little extra work	here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you are finished	1428.1238539688338
9984. each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work	progresses to insure snug fitting	1891.7142304059075
9985. the order of fitting is not	too important	167.1750061155392
9986. however we started with the first row of bars and worked	our way back	1412.1341146730485
9987. since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs	and notches is used throughout we will only describe the construction	of one locking bar	2616.584017312809
9988. figs 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions	249.27526236616782
9989. all the bars are cut from f brass	167.18131502311127
9990. the lengths of each piece are	listed at the bottom of fig 7	1182.6611813806287
9991. bar c is 2-34'' long	14.826029999369288
9992. draw-file the edges square up the ends and put a slight chamfer	on the edges so they will not snag in the frame	3488.833295515332
9993. fig 8 gives	the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes	377.189022230687
9994. center-punch and drill	the no 31 hole 716'' from one end of the bar	1419.9312621082715
9995. chuck a length	of 18'' dia drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning	device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file	a slight taper 18'' long	3666.2822183547614
9996. cut the piece about 932'' or 516''	long and drive it into the no 31 hole drilled in the locking	bar	3060.8174280944395
9997. file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 18''	above the bar	1101.006836596009
9998. this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3	957.5028913277586
9999. place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3	502.20340486931747
10000. scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of	tappet 3 parallel to piece a	2826.377314112788
10001. see the drawings for the shape	of the notch	262.13335291988824
10002. scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out	with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool	3485.745207659778
10003. we used	the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about 	188.77056063477409
10004. 020'' thick and	1'' dia fitted on a 18'' dia mandrel	756.6687341342553
10005. such disks are	very handy for cutting and shaping small parts	500.97345610825835
10006. file to a smooth finish	22.002797825400993
10007. a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular	shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without	marring an adjoining one	3004.9728141272194
10008. endeavor to get the notches as much alike	as possible	563.7327839570436
10009. the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel	dog will slide easily over it	1407.8820996888019
10010. assemble the parts in the frame and	test the sliding action of the mating pieces	1653.340779578363
10011. all matching surfaces	should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis	1108.7010738332451
10012. chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 18'' dia drill rod in a	drill press or	electric hand tool	2588.5778784637655
10013. fashion a sharp scribing point about 364''	long on one end using swiss pattern files	1099.8331302563643
10014. this tool can also be	made with a lathe	392.6513435839421
10015. scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on	mathematics	787.1836117661221
10016. without math the men who are continually seeking the causes	of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round	would not have any means of analyzing standardizing and communicating	the things they discover and learn	6348.172620377951
10017. math and the formulas that	allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential	to any scientific endeavor	1869.7481799183638
10018. hot rodding is a science	22.366606018720947
10019. it's	not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate	on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit	but it is nevertheless a science	3464.0360290939907
10020. but because science is based on mathematics	doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician	2357.3513142910897
10021. a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years	without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems;	however he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and	the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few	formulas that apply to rodding	5045.2117102446255
10022. a mathematical formula is nothing	more than a pattern for solving a specific problem	1421.066113735858
10023. it places the	various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation	to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can	be computed	3229.107898463309
10024. the first step in using a formula is to insert the	numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions	in the formula	3687.80253730912
10025. this changes the formula to an equation	93.32490816505161
10026. the	equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem	965.6645093839376
10027. equations for rodding formulas are not complicated	93.73790146202636
10028. they involve	only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic	classes	1171.2089032775652
10029. however it is essential that the various mathematical symbols	used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes	can be done properly and in their correct order	3110.076417858107
10030. they indicate	simple division multiplication subtraction and addition	250.32019075115485
10031. the	symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers	placed one above the other	1417.0940130086212
10032. the lower number is always divided into the	upper number: f   the symbol for multiplication is 	1128.2590572312115
10033. it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row	646.496187810289
10034. for example:	f numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any	order	1395.2105606748084
10035. the result will be the same regardless of the order used	502.4137530769053
10036. the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign	392.0418655589268
10037. this is	nothing more than a dash	94.67706778323256
10038. it separates two or more numbers	65.72104576548875
10039. the number	on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on	the left of the symbol	1889.3913596110706
10040. for example: f when more than two figures	are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried	out from the left to right if the result is to be correct	5006.699345950559
10041. for example	for the problem f 10 from 25 equals 15 then 6 from 15 equals	9	1431.7680731187675
10042. addition is indicated by the + symbol	30.25368184940753
10043. the symbol is	used to separate two or more numbers	377.22298133351234
10044. for example: f numbers separated	by addition symbols may be placed in any order	1397.359413477069
10045. when solving	an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all	the division steps first	to reduce those parts of the equation to their	numerical value	3106.172345792709
10046. multiplication subtraction and addition can then	be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left	end of the equation and working toward the right	4459.9676572503995
10047. completing the	division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication	subtraction or addition steps: f this would be reduced	by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12	3556.6925999939754
10048. this part	of the equation would then become 4	392.2354051980905
10049. for use in formulas fractions	should be converted to their decimal equivalents	643.3124655511107
10050. the easiest	way to do this is with a conversion chart	754.1351904621886
10051. charts for this purpose	are available from many sources	261.4015504304667
10052. they are included in all types of mathematical	handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision	measuring instruments	2809.94430182638
10053. the various mathematical processes can	be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places	1580.7304845219492
10054. shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental	effect on the accuracy of the final result	2581.2851461888445
10055. a constant is a number that remains the same	regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant	equation	2176.9421954708855
10056. it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved	correctly	958.6529073501782
10057. rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport	261.51931629436456
10058. the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases	and	quite often are necessary for completing entry blanks for different	events	3682.9061388085706
10059. when it is needed one formula is as important as another	504.10181493325643
10060. however some formulas are used more than others	252.00801921942676
10061. we'll take	them in the general order of their popularity	373.9055326885066
10062. a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine	959.3815390060897
10063. displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume	166.49462316630516
10064. most	entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information	because of class restrictions	1406.2352537961904
10065. it is good to be able to compute	displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking	can be computed	2175.0907510432494
10066. factors involved in the displacement formula	are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders the length of the	piston stroke the number of cylinders in the engine and a constant	4825.319354428253
10067. 7854 which is one-quarter of 3	43.335383701709745
10068. 1416 another constant	known as pi	65.1582825872018
10069. pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions	of circles	500.99983025059555
10070. actually the engine displacement formula is	the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type	with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the	engine	5155.222064646344
10071. the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and	then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying	the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length	of the cylinders	3851.412939103324
10072. multiplying the result by the number of cylinders	in the engine gives the engine's total displacement	1874.8242408875103
10073. dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give	the displacement in cubic inches	943.3944800902524
10074. dimensions in centimeters and fractions	of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters		808.0339338924875
10075. 54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16	94.11541177044211
10076. for example let's consider a standard	283 cubic inch chevy v8	756.0756309334691
10077. these engines have a cylinder diameter	of 3-78 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches	1253.410703862292
10078. the formula with	the fractions converted to decimals becomes f	559.3295683825588
10079. to arrive	at the answer multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of	the group and working to the right	2176.3476813021607
10080. the different steps will look like	this: f	a cylinder's compression ratio	is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume or its displacement	with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber	5344.878421078245
10081. cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber	volume must be measured with a liquid	1252.6181059981916
10082. cylinder volume is	determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula:	f	1648.8244913933675
10083. to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers	in the cylinder head install the valves and spark plug in the chamber	and support the head so that its gasket surface is level	3665.1399397448026
10084. then pour	water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill	the chamber to its gasket surface	3076.4895237277497
10085. do not overfill the chamber	14.874827599375285
10086. this	is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension	1411.3310552948499
10087. such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface	around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber	2172.977553506706
10088. the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting	the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from	the original quantity	4301.144951269382
10089. most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters	making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches	1415.6382137070214
10090. however the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic	centimeters	962.1142303724439
10091. the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will	be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are	used	2177.037650482719
10092. the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be	quoted in the same terms	2110.837291675643
10093. the volume of the cylinder opening	in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square	inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch	3099.404585256724
10094. sometimes	it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening	but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy	that it won't affect the final computation	5017.476512013616
10095. the volume of the opening	is added to the combustion chamber volume	644.0704174144549
10096. another thing	that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between	the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston	is in top dead center position	5777.219975871033
10097. compute this volume by measuring	the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately	as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring	device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth	4414.404748057219
10098. the	formula for this step is: f this volume is added to the total volume	of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening	3488.907162579101
10099. the total of	these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume	642.1615284829147
10100. after the factors just described have been computed they are applied	to the following formula: f   for an example let's dream	up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic	inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches	6673.66374585841
10101. applying these figures	to the formula we get the equation: f the compression ratio is	10 to 1	1576.2598479423136
10102. this method of computing compression ratio cannot be	used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly	shaped heads	3278.044789190028
10103. any irregularity on the piston heads will make	it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion	chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot	be readily computed	3445.0175369220037
10104. the only way to determine the final combustion	chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid	while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston	is in top dead center position	6321.779261763329
10105. there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships	of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire	size	2450.2020061102635
10106. by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can	be determined for any combination of the other three	2815.2694189783892
10107. to simplify	the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of	the factors	943.6674713555265
10108. these are   mph for car speed   rpm	for engine crankshaft speed   r for rear axle gear ratio	w for tire size   tire size can be determined in	several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is	by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly	7707.052970401642
10109. this	is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire	is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft	2465.0664449186143
10110. a tire must be inflated	to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to	its operating weight when this measurement is made	4110.089617167056
10111. the measurement	must be in inches	43.1310528774053
10112. any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement	must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics	2830.894287797264
10113. when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used	in the formula	1411.8296276683063
10114. to determine car speed for a given combination	of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is: f	for an engine speed of 5000 rpm a gear ratio of 4	5149.635794528919
10115. she is owned by ralph h kroening milwaukee	wis who according to the railbirds can feel justly proud of her	2826.4358003333837

10141. the fourth time in	harness he walked off like a gentleman	760.082675159938
10142. being blistered for curbs has	delayed his work somewhat	261.31240182461863
10143. but up to date he has shown as much as any	in the big simpson stable	1890.5154012270802

10226. the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun	but he's always on the lookout for new and	better arms	2176.535832025784
10227. he's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's	a real hunter and shooter eager to improve his sport	2593.2752298593473
10228. well if you're	that kind of sportsman we're here to help you	636.6816975010561
10229. you've probably	given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack	but it's not easy to decide on a new one	3680.4262764427976
10230. you still have time to	drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time	to decide on them is now	2316.933416786232
10231. as a christmas service i've taken a close	look at this year's crop of new models	1885.2092492294512
10232. here they are with my	comments and judgments	167.30302913014793
10233. read on take your pick- and start dropping	those hints	559.6944541685368
10234. first on my own list would be two arms- a rifle	and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense	2201.5295258879805
10235. for me a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute	a truly new design	1891.8844265622797
10236. such modifications are all for the best but	it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change	arms-making concepts	2333.1771494049704
10237. bill ruger's long-awaited deerstalker	is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the	modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short light quick-handling	fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug	at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for	our most popular big game- whitetail	7866.859210129148
10238. ruger reports that	on his recent african safari the little 	188.60021846529463
10239. 44 magnum cartridge was a	real work horse	253.04491143298773
10240. small antelope were generally grassed with one shot	and the 	190.14447074966694
10241. 44 magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck kob and wart hog with	deadly efficiency; these are fairly large tough animals	2606.300281507522
10242. the deadliness of the 	1.7312212654765422
10243. 44 magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to	me	754.9523201786044
10244. at least five years ago tom robinson of marlin made up an overunder	double rifle for me in this caliber using the now defunct model	90 action in 20-gauge size	3217.835048754713
10245. after figuring out how to regulate the	barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this	little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin's underground	test gallery	5476.866010746594
10246. we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill	ruger in his first experiments: three or four bullets would be	placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then unaccountably	one could stray far out of the group	4294.999141069335
10247. ruger learned that this	was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting	the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet	3499.6723284131212
10248. the new jacketed slug	in 	7.197063256302167
10249. but even without jacketed bullets i	had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt	that first year	3454.5172203243665
10250. within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that	hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket and i caught him just behind	the left foreleg at 60 yards	2860.503164405206
10251. he moved only about 30 feet after	the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed	through a sapling	3497.9215222571374
10252. three more deer have fallen to this same	gun and all were one-shot kills	937.9342189980695
10253. my double was made with standard-weight	revolver barrels and although	it compares well in other respects it's considerably heavier than	the deerstalker which only scales about 6-12 pounds	4485.7165200832915
10254. if ever	a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter this is it	941.7654350603586
10255. the deerstalker	points with the ease speed and precision of a fine imported	double shotgun and its trigger pull is light and sharp	3490.845979325945
10256. the 240-grain	bullet leaves the muzzle at 1850 fps which gives it all the smash	needed at woods ranges	1722.1173288682737
10257. with five shots at the immediate command	of the hunter's trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination	2831.853478113667
10258. the second really new development this year was a revolver	handling a different sort of varmint load- the 	974.9597164691473
10259. 22 remington jet	magnum center fire	65.29465658043692
10260. at present it's available in one model the	fine and familiar smith + wesson magnum revolver	long a top-quality handgun among target arms	1458.3117166017732
10261. the velocity of this 	2.576510603453791
10262. 22-caliber	40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2460 fps and it's	the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge with a mid-range	rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range	3448.390801863638
10263. this is a varmint load	pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game	1867.5472320231643
10264. it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry	of feathers	1581.5386486748866
10265. the most intriguing aspect of the s+w magnum	chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard 	1818.7144489718025
10266. 22 rim-fires	by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers	372.27985922380196
10267. you may therefore	convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm although the difference	in the point of impact can be somewhat disconcerting	3697.8729550405724
10268. the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine; i tested	it in my scoped s+w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a	chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun	steadily	4439.158622565328
10269. the fact that the deerstalker	and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't	mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models actions and calibers	4471.98330313344
10270. aside from the ruger carbine a number of hunting rifles have been	introduced for the first time	1409.6709931849823
10271. here are the brands	and the new models	250.82991011208318
10272. newcomers to the american hunter	are the browning group of bolt-action high-power rifles	790.4985717227526
10273. they have	fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal	and the stock wood	2128.523664913134
10274. barrel weights vary sensibly with the various	calibers available and these include the standard bores	plus the magnums; the latter include the 	1458.2892356173604
10275. shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard	on all of the magnums except the 	653.5316604520236
10276. stock designs are excellent	for use with scopes	165.824911543903
10277. colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are	all made with sako actions regardless of caliber	1178.6764629525467
10278. 222's have	the short action; the 	20.272036365935236
10279. 308 the medium action and the 	30.46401400298074
10280. 270	f and the magnums the long action		79.4491002551076
10281. previously fn actions	were used for the larger cartridges	391.63060621711253
10282. high standard has	introduced a 	7.2886833080042495
10283. 22 auto the sport-king in two grades- field and special		283.8181127763762
10284. it's a streamlined	rifle fast and well-made	94.05823955334054
10285. 22 magnum rim-fire	rifles 1961's lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader		657.5517703293212
10286. previously known as jefferson arms kodiak has given	this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design and the	260 is the first autoloader to handle 	1926.2613377111775
10287. marlin	has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings	752.4049200240918
10288. the	model 99 is a light-weight streamlined 	43.61946474298542
10289. 22 rim-fire auto	with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles	960.40432264998
10290. it's extremely	accurate for an auto and the test rifle i tried was completely	trouble-free in functioning	1422.739892803137
10291. the 989 is an even newer 	30.38629189100131
10292. 22	auto this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip	377.5188646038688
10293. once again the	mossberg targo outfit has appeared but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun	combination	1884.3564148379544
10294. the bore is unrifled but is provided with an	insert tube which is rifled and which surprisingly gives pretty fair	accuracy even though it's only 3-12 inches long	2995.9301512101183
10295. you can unscrew	this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with 	960.5906652423648
10296. 22 shotshells-	to break the little targo clay targets	260.8371114890523
10297. a trap for throwing	these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can	throw his own targets	2833.8518813347537
10298. a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular	hand trap are also available	939.8872705728079
10299. you can have your choice of a seven-shot	repeater the 340tr or a single-shot the 320tr		1131.2618041911667
10300. the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting	or for economic wing-shooting practice but it's tougher than it looks	to run up a score on the clay birds	3096.732624329506
10301. they'll travel 50 feet or	more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to	break one after it passes the 35-foot mark	3897.3679092158263
10302. the combination of thin	pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds	right now!   big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line	for 1961 with the addition of the 	2754.9941965255503
10303. 375 and 	0.30041514999999996
10304. 458 to the list of model	725's	94.11318618055634
10305. these are made on special order only in kodiak grade	with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads;	they weigh around nine pounds	3703.1587016565236
10306. a shortened version of the	highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961	942.3897545717233
10307. this	carbine has an 18-12-inch	barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's	model 760 pump with a short-barrel	3260.7268610789893
10308. this design is hard to beat	for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard	1253.9736460163851
10309. presently	the 742c is available in f	139.94033095688212
10310. the latest versions of the famous	savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight and the	99 deluxe which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger	design	2713.8145594874563
10311. the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will	make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new	safety is easier and faster to operate	4306.236543498601
10312. a fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 and they're	good bets for your christmas gift list if you're wondering what to	get for a youngster	2974.9944719788064
10313. the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49	- a lever-action single-shot patterned	after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western	look	2370.0912679453127
10314. because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid	appeal than any other model	1096.6543149836396
10315. the action is a drop-block handling all	the standard 	191.50210497165818
10316. marlin's latest is also designed	for the beginning shooter although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty	of barrel weight and ample stock	2187.213194687871
10317. this is the model 122	; it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety-	ie the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun	cocked for the next shot	3879.4067716975696
10318. stock design is excellent and this model	is a good first gun	643.504694028313
10319. another boy's model is the 	10.926404536074898
10320. 22 single-shot remington	514c which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a	short- 12-12-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-12	2330.1818138939125
10321. a beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year	393.10185905178406
10322. the single-barrel stevens 940y is made with a side lever	rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong	enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does	indeed open very easily	4133.585637574368
10323. this gun has a 12-12-inch stock and is	available in either 20 or 	657.8678923081345
10324. there's another addition to	the stevens line the pump-action model 77 in 	343.7327179000989
10325. 410 which	you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters	like this gauge and type of scattergun too	3285.0969729403637
10326. although	there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year	a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit	the market	2589.421281844164
10327. for example a browning trap version of the superposed	overunder the broadway differs	from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore	end a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast	sighting	6201.43019316943
10328. the colt line now includes a new scattergun the standard	or custom pump model in	12 16 and 20	1734.8991434428444
10329. firearms international has introduced another	import this one from finland	561.2316119108268
10330. it's the valmet a 12-gauge	overunder very much like the old remington 32- which was	so fine	a gun that today a used one still brings high prices	3002.698748510408
10331. high	standard has also added two models to its line	558.9763664370547
10332. the supermatic trophy	is a 12-gauge auto	94.9397445399386
10333. the flite-king trophy	is a pump gun in 12 or 16	759.9059807767735
10334. either model is a very good	dollar value	168.5615358138763
10335. mossberg's latest contribution to the field is	the model 500; this is an improved version of the old	model 200 a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun	3711.5382456739026
10336. see page 24 for a complete	report on it	260.95584605565205
10337. 22 jet- which	i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two	biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among	1961's handguns	3703.6409204566685
10338. livery stable- j vernon prop coaching had declined	considerably by 1905 but the sign was still there near the old	wells fargo building in san francisco creaking in the fog as it	had for thirty years	3848.104057429181
10339. john vernon had had all the patronage he cared	for- he had prospered but he could not retire from horsedom	2840.386004064713
10340. coaching	was in his blood	14.713310928864194
10341. he had two interests in life: the pleasures	of the table and driving	1181.6580615023124
10342. twice a week he drove his tallyho over the	santa cruz road upland and through the redwood forest with orchards	below him at one hand and glimpses of the pacific at the other	3572.9498547393027
10343. the	journey back he made along the coast road traveling hell-for-leather	every lantern of the tallyho ablaze	2130.246881254451
10344. the southward route	was the classic run in california and the most fashionable	794.413071948215
10345. his patronage	on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans- regulars	most of them and trenchermen like himself	2809.7619536258753
10346. they did not complain	at the inhuman hour of starting nor of the	tariff which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco	2457.4344761152183
10347. breakfast was at the palace hotel luncheon was somewhere in the	mountain forest and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa	cruz	3681.8289301407726
10348. gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring so	halts were contrived between meals	1098.8436175751503
10349. then the chinese hostler who rode	with vernon on the box would break open a hamper and produce filets	of smoked bass or sturgeon sandwiches pickled eggs and a rum sangaree	to be heated over a spirit lamp	6081.478844394542
10350. in spring and in autumn	the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend	of mine	2031.518060137681
10351. they gathered roots bulbs odd ferns leaves and bits of	resin from the rare santa lucia fir which exists only on a forty-five	mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains	5166.049008125625
10352. in the spanish	days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense	935.8568629229783
10353. it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar	1182.3982476766244
10354. vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips but he could	arrange no schedule with the cooks and he was glad when the trips dropped	off and the botanists began to motor out by themselves	3765.461602901041
10355. my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular	tallyho run	1405.2242308429381
10356. this was an honor like dining with a captain at his private	table	791.4261626780701
10357. vernon's office adjoined the stable and the walls were	adorned with brightly colored lithographs the folk art of the period	2806.6503069074706
10358. they advertised harness polish liniments ball's rubber boots	green river whiskey hood's sarsaparilla patent medicines	shoe blacking and chewing tobacco	1881.875365431067

10847. hold edges	together right side up	43.51760204973753
10848. hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-12-foot beam and every inch	a family boat	1656.3935530176543
10849. menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the	helmsman has a clear view	946.5626350574869
10850. youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves	safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom bunks for	three galley and marine toilet	3470.6129085220114
10851. the gals can sun themselves in the	roomy aft cockpit	374.39907319778916
10852. all are well distributed not crowded together near	the stern	558.6342056572809
10853. and with passenger weight shifted forward hotei levels	off for speed under power of a merc 800	1420.9377920171926
10854. the 80-hp motor drives	her at 25 mph with six aboard!   with only two aboard hotei	does better than 27	mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this	speed even in a three-foot chop	5633.863564186599
10855. she also banks into a turn like	a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all	over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser	3128.067435554103
10856. nor is she a wet boat	65.80124923562036
10857. we've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry	262.21352964547333
10858. a lot of	thought went into storage space construction	393.87509060843576
10859. there's a large compartment	in the forward cockpit for charts and other items	789.273893143521
10860. the cabin	has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for	water skiis life jackets etc	2596.1997612177506
10861. the aft cockpit has a f storage bin	over six feet long that doubles as a seat	1417.6553313414693
10862. on each side of the motor	well there's storage for battery bumpers line and spare props with	six-gallon gas tanks below	3040.205813764592
10863. the well itself is designed to take two	merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon	long-cruise gas tank below it	2744.7622343263965
10864. needless to say you can't	build hotei in a couple of weeks	957.0245056311848
10865. our building time was slightly	over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom	sink head and hardware was under $800	2602.9054459833815
10866. a comparable manufactured	boat would cost close to $3000	394.0969051057182
10867. consider what you have to earn to be	able to spend the $3000 and your building time is well worth it	2018.6689065044793
10868. a	gator trailer model 565 is used to transport the boat to the waterways	1413.3282542216027
10869. this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save	you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years	2459.495881955552
10870. all framing	in hotei is one-inch mahogany which in the dressed state you	buy it is about the 1316-inch thickness specified in the drawings	3708.519625404817
10871. therefore	the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens	etc on a table saw	1579.305823135683
10872. besides flathead bronze screws silicon bronze	stronghold nails	are used extensively in assembly and weldwood	resorcinal glue is used in all the joints	3492.88736294574
10873. follows a thorough study of the drawings	94.37869230477685
10874. start by laying out the six	frames and the transom on a level floor	1424.6441426906226
10875. draw each outline in a different-color	chalk one on top of the other	790.1474286150105
10876. in this way you will be	able to detect any obvious mistakes	958.3125315593595
10877. the transom frame is made	first with the joints lapped glued and fastened with one-inch no	12 stronghold nails	1731.8112438862368
10878. after notching it for the keelson chines and	battens the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue	and the same type	nails	3716.8886444144678
10879. all frames are butted at the joints and 38-inch plywood gussets	are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the one-inch	no 12 nails	2990.891755730944
10880. the frames are notched only for the keelson	and the chines	760.7738190047684
10881. if notched for the battens they would require more work	be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge	water could flow through	2870.446804435474
10882. nowhere in the boat do the frames come in	contact with the plywood planking	1422.9941307439958
10883. the jig is erected after the	frames and transom are complete	509.6185828299146
10884. this is an important step because	any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull	as you advance in construction	3054.2164366973775
10885. be sure all members are parallel	vertical and level as required	502.9237797531291
10886. after the frames and transom	are set up on the jig and temporarily braced a piece of three-inch-wide	mahogany	is butted between frames one and two below the line	of the keelson	5196.035559049327
10887. the frames are glued and screwed to this piece	259.7985956751364
10888. the	joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated	fiberglas cloth and nailed	2348.0522122399543
10889. it is over this piece that the	laminated stem and keelson are spliced	784.9586055658549
10890. the keelson made of	two three-inch widths is next installed	556.2808019680867
10891. the first piece is glued	and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames	one and two	2049.8234459102564
10892. the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the	first	959.1328505174745
10893. note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end	638.8877391299679
10894. one-inch no 10 screws are used in both cases	393.03310371731067
10895. a stem	jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to	frame one	1255.17928652461
10896. the stem is laminated from four pieces	142.05773414550214
10897. take two three-inch-wide	pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make	the four	1421.3596717888902
10898. then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and	bend them into place on the jig	2608.5956098735924
10899. the first two pieces butt against	the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace	between the first two frames	2604.508705337247
10900. the second two pieces lap over the inner	member of the keelson and butt against the outer member	2369.6745452001333
10901. they're	glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson	501.4552597067959
10902. a number of c	clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets	1906.0924134062407
10903. all bottom battens are two inches wide	93.60190260467817
10904. the side ones are a half-inch	narrower	141.3725992297759
10905. the battens are carefully fastened in place after some	necessary fairing on all frames	946.7739568226532
10906. glue and 1-12-inch no 10 screws	are used	252.74969926767557
10907. placement is important because the rear seat bunks and	front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens	2328.940898471634
10908. with the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they	are glued and screwed after careful beveling	2817.0197240543166
10909. the chines go in the same	way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength	and easier bending	2308.651482421039
10910. fairing is always a tedious job but	the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple	jig	3288.3526975272207
10911. i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer	with a pair of sure grips	1718.1159501338607
10912. the aluminum flush against the battens	acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson	to the proper bevels easily	3885.8117469376425
10913. if you don't own a planer and don't	want to buy one it's well worth renting	1256.0677370465155
10914. is five-ply 38-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood	141.87959015036483
10915. this	can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long	372.0104088003326
10916. the 42-inch width	leaves very little waste	140.06490882345486
10917. plank the sides first	using glue and one-inch no 12 stronghold nails at all battens	the stem and the transom	1894.0131007857483
10918. another person inside with a weight against	each batten will help in the fastening	1414.6311353406745
10919. the best procedure is to	have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off	1730.9248969696278
10920. i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter	cable for this job	961.0373133016692
10921. it's good for cutting all the planking because	it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter	the plywood like a saber saw	2864.5265158304783
10922. when cut the planking is clamped	in place for a final and careful trimming	1413.9395634727648
10923. then it is marked on the	inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and	all the battens	2041.2142322881227
10924. it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings	251.59637952103975
10925. the	next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at	the contact points	1734.8508891089587
10926. then it is replaced and fastened	65.29488840871988
10927. the bottom planking	is applied in the same manner	261.708162627969
10928. after planking the bottom	gets a layer of fiberglas	391.6855793056054
10929. the spray rails are first glued on the	outside and fastened from the inside with screws	1260.9122999474464
10930. then the chines are	rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation	1189.7851282702293
10931. since the	sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also rough-sanded	in that area	1563.5982835597842
10932. the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at	a time	1183.351033252437
10933. a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line	by about three inches	1571.4054978805225
10934. lay the cloth in place and trim it to size	560.6774169004642
10935. then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin	641.63595149651
10936. when the resin	has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish	1893.4442268242724
10937. i used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding	the hardener	794.3243758445808
10938. using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with	the resin and then apply the cloth	2360.4516015647578
10939. when the cloth is smooth apply	another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller	1252.9460684573223
10940. be sure it is	well saturated and then allow it to harden	959.3754007125684
10941. when the whole bottom	has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth	at the keel line and near the spray rail	2730.9707820662816
10942. then lay a three-inch-wide	strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of	the stem	2825.495803534156
10943. before the resin has hardened screw a one-inch mahogany keel	strip along the centerline	946.9937312516042
10944. this protects the bottom in beaching	64.95351968801721
10945. fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co	1605 w elizabeth ave linden n j	1253.2851792501356
10946. they will also	supply literature on application	140.58039460920196
10947. is now turned	over and placed in a level well-braced	position	503.2944328083436
10948. i set it on the gator trailer	141.8923112110852
10949. i laid three layers	of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye	at this time	2023.2380527276018
10950. for added strength i also fastened a small block on	each side of every frame and batten joint	2362.5896713982547
10951. again these blocks were	set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed	499.02852912285005
10952. after trimming	off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them	to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed	5014.206029379531
10953. this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom	787.7674449476856
10954. these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry	564.7248412638266
10955. when they're	on the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten	790.9788034694369
10956. the	sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from	frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace	4300.454987147119
10957. note	another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between	these pieces	1257.5681884278952
10958. the decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine	plywood	141.18931173107643
10959. all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior	fir plywood	647.0155867018315
10960. most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring	562.330172681971
10961. the exception is where the flooring butts	95.03722739579267
10962. these battens are glued	and screwed to the frames	393.02106149333474
10963. with all deck battens in place the	bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line	1422.2534754463425
10964. use one coat of	firzite and one coat of marine paint	750.1764037816301
10965. bottoms of the floorboards are	also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place	1108.290569310051
10966. after	the decking is on the cabin sides are installed	561.795110559306
10967. they're followed	by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated	376.8370537823026
10968. the windshield glass	is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin	967.8234211319732
10969. bunks are framed up and installed as indicated	166.53556341449686
10970. a head is a handy	thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the	port bunk	2820.954308734844
10971. the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into	the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above	the sink	2753.8580409951023
10972. for padding the seats and bunks i used ensolite type	m	758.0669003897223
10973. lightweight non-absorbent fire resistant and dimensionally stable	it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement	1409.3081858933106
10974. available	in f sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot	966.9577721938047
10975. you can build this vacation cottage yourself	93.96401312814106
10976. it is a full scale	small	but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete	in every detail	2822.5025228647487
10977. because of the unique design by the architect egils	hermanovski you can build most of it in your own home workshop	in your spare time	2593.2427741449046
10978. most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials	and requires the use of only simple tools	2125.2464835561427
10979. on the following	pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to	your vacation cottage from choosing the proper site to applying the	final trim	3351.445602983725
10980. in recognition of the growing trend for second homes	or vacation cottages we have designed this one specifically with	the family handyman in mind	3692.7377702467793
10981. it is a big project not to be taken lightly	373.23263868557586
10982. but each step has been broken down into easy stages utilizing	standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the	handyman	3501.6879212207577
10983. the idea behind our design is modular units	or panelization	378.82209610978316
10984. everything possible has been scaled to standard	sizes and measurements of materials	960.8494904803874
10985. wall panels and structural timbers	are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting	1582.3989039515213
10986. we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so	that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop	panel by panel according to plan	4847.307337461736
10987. thus when you have prepared your	foundation and laid the floor these can be trucked to the site and erected	with a small crew of friends in a weekend	3118.699201189128
10988. the roof timbers are	precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed	in a matter of three or four days	3906.705449233779
10989. then you can do the finishing	touches at your leisure	375.81347783341954
10990. due to the fact that building	codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first	thing to do is to find out what if any they are	4653.798702955393
10991. close to a large	city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote	section there might be no restrictions at all	2719.405995053215
10992. this can usually	be found out at the nearest town hall	750.6523144965929
10993. at the same time check the electrical	plumbing and sanitary requirements as well as possible zoning	regulations	1420.3930516436656
10994. whether electricity and public water and sewers are available	or not check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p	gas	3501.0252294360776
10995. be sure that this information	is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion	947.9478197921732
10996. if there	are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed	form	1413.9758383682642
10997. where a building permit is required find out what you must	present when applying for one	1253.4891168007216
10998. in many cases you must file a complete	set of plans with the local building inspector	1883.530263149781
10999. these will be available	at cost from our plans department	374.48474527575553
11000. some general	things to look for in a site if you haven't already bought one are	accessibility water drainage and orientation	3063.433376031191
11001. how are the roads	and how will they stand up	372.9901620815509
11002. is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;	swampy areas or intermittent springs	1185.6368625775983
11003. a visit in the early	spring after a thaw will be very informative	793.0759793098302
11004. note where the sun rises	and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms	come from	2372.296260838392
11005. will the view be something you can live with	262.9993683549848
11006. don't	worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative	foundations later on	2126.3205503663416
11007. with this first issue	we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic	and the expandable	1897.094868166411
11008. this will be for the	shell of the house only and does not include	the carport or balcony	2372.405178446362
11009. this will permit you to get a rough	estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost	1728.5072418117604
11010. bear in mind	that this does not include interior panels for partitions fancy	flooring appliances and fixtures electrical wiring and plumbing	all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues	5321.871597339935
11011. the	wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard f and f of	a good grade free from structural faults	2029.5118875961314
11012. they should be as straight	as possible as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when	the walls are erected	3061.9263797767044
11013. the outside surface of the solid units shall	be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood plastic coated	panel board high density particle board asbestos-cement board or	any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building	supply dealer	4393.445237164955
11014. the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof and	the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired	2811.791957308039
11015. all panel	board comes in standard f foot size	259.4403048355038
11016. it is recommended that panels	be both glued as well as nailed to the frame	1645.8884014926175
11017. the fixed window panels	with louvers should have a good grade of 18-inch double-strength glass	set in a mastic glazing compound	2032.0764552314365
11018. the louvers are constructed as	shown in the detail with a drop door for ventilation	1653.182659329304
11019. there are standard	sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels	requiring them	1255.0148987466061
11020. the door panels are designed to accommodate standard	doors which should be of exterior grade	1646.5206348418342
11021. the filler panels for the gable	ends are cut from full f sheets as shown leaving no wastage	1578.426326492297
11022. the	battens covering the joints are of f stock and are applied after	the walls are erected	2122.2681068484676
11023. all nails should be rustproof and aluminum is	highly recommended	375.41293631879785
11024. note: if 12-inch panel board is used inside	and out or 58-inch one side and 38-inch the other and 18-inch glass	is used stock lumber in f f and f can be used in making the	glass panels	6063.888644088588
11025. other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special	size lumber for the glass trim	793.1883867753215
11026. in any case there is no special milling	or rabbeting required for the panels	1418.5045921537417
11027. with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting	tools fixtures and attachments available the drill press has become	a basic home workshop tool	2600.95258351135
11028. the drill press consists of a vertical	shaft which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a	drill chuck a tubular housing in which the spindle is mounted	a head in which the quill is mounted a feed lever which moves the	quill up or down a power source and a movable table upon which the work	is placed	8411.093644617653
11029. there is often a means of locking the quill and on larger	presses the table can be tilted	1577.4999726449182
11030. the size of the press is	usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity	or distance between the spindle center and the	column	3271.817866143135
11031. a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center	of a 22 inch board or circle	1892.1225190211208
11032. a new radial drill press with	a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done	at any angle	3486.318516806231
11033. the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on	the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work	2324.8407010922992
11034. the drill press should be leveled and depending	on whether it is a bench or floor model bolted securely to a	sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws	5657.5471798014605
11035. this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy	93.91288581622851
11036. a coat	of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the	polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth	will discourage rusting of the column and quill	5807.462270654649
11037. presses not fitted	with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in	the lubrication holes in the quill	2331.0760066852176
11038. the rest of the press should be kept	clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush	2135.9052265711252
11039. be careful to	keep the drive belt free of oil and grease	646.9443293275721
11040. belt tension is adjusted	by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount	1646.315016164588
11041. keep	the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by	hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle	bearings	2981.142316950593
11042. most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises	the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds	the quill in the raised position	4283.981393388325
11043. the return spring tension may be	adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing	with a pair of pliers	loosening the lock nut or screw and rotating the housing	until the desired tension is achieved	3943.5400863151954
11044. turning the housing clockwise	will reduce tension counter-clockwise will increase it	744.5183604237134
11045. drill speeds are important if you want	a good job	560.8131751787696
11046. each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed	depending on the material worked	1110.0263294949186
11047. on most drill presses it is impossible	to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the	drive belt on the step-cone pulleys	4116.777573414898
11048. you will find a chart giving the	various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere	in the instruction booklet that came with the tool	2724.0590980970187
11049. see the table	on page 34 for exact recommended speeds	566.2029176169585
11050. generally the larger the	tool and the harder the material the slower the speed	956.6341981375347
11051. feed pressure	is also of major importance	139.9028188127824
11052. too much pressure will force the	tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed	or broken tools	2031.3810082513155
11053. too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard	material causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting	edge	3265.7248405256023
11054. the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed	with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even	rate	2742.7694234819005
11055. there are numerous types and styles	of tools to drill holes	748.4425054489091
11056. the most common are the twist drill the	solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades the double spur	bit and the power wood bit	2456.1826563807476
11057. all will do a good job if sharp but the	twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others since they	do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual	boring starts	5793.320740852787
11058. the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting	large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by	reversing the cutter blade	2590.5660033897702
11059. since fly cutters are one sided and not	balanced they should be used at the slowest speed available and fed	very slowly to avoid binding	3907.9619689715446
11060. fly cutters can fool you into putting	your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid nicked fingers	keep your hands well out of the way	3209.3424746463547
11061. when drilling all the way through a workpiece always place a	piece of scrap wood underneath	1880.384754601356
11062. this will not only protect the work	table but also assure a clean breakthrough	950.6700995334068
11063. another method of assuring	a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through	then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over	and finish from the other side	5928.348151587795
11064. in soft woods with pronounced grain	there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander due to the varying	hardness of the wood	2453.986699742081
11065. in this case drilling a small pilot hole or	clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy	2375.1517188375374
11066. when a hole	is to be bored to a predetermined depth mark the depth on the side	of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark	3562.8307513268473
11067. the depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to	exact and identical depth	2587.227533434209
11068. the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts	are of unusual interest in many respects	1259.5458372226544
11069. for their length their	types of construction their picturesque settings and their literary	associations they should be known and remembered	2821.1186673578995
11070. in this sequence	i shall write about them in the order of their erection	938.9269436089878
11071. the	first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part- and perhaps	the most interesting one connected newbury with	salisbury point	3483.055903289523
11072. this paper was signed by forty-five	persons subscribing a total of two hundred shares	932.8603053836812
11073. a month	later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that	the bridge was to be built	2811.14420963755
11074. the matter was considered and reconsidered	and finally opposed but in spite of many objections the court	granted a charter on january 9 1792	2462.6725296390505
11075. on november 26 of that year the	bridge was completed and opened	955.435412062021
11076. timothy palmer who invented	and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges	was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex	or deer island bridge although the actual work was carried	out under the direction of william coombs who received  300 as	recompense	4887.311115099958
11077. this two-part bridge is best described by rev timothy	dwight president of yale college in his travels in new-england	and new-york published in new haven in 1821	4303.328265548386
11078. he says	of it:   it consists of two divisions separated by an island	at a small distance from the southern shore	2028.3244514228913
11079. the division between	the island and this shore consists principally of an arch; whose	chord is one hundred and sixty feet and whose vortex is forty feet	above the high-water mark	5001.145430154349
11080. in appearance and	construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge	260.64075234319955
11081. the whole length of	essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four	1876.8782883376873
11082. i have already mentioned that mr timothy palmer of newburyport	was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country	1873.990772739838
11083. as mr	palmer was educated to house-building only and had never seen a	structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit	for the invention	4287.039558214399
11084. it is hardly necessary to remind students	of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby	rowley; that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was	sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect	moody spofford	4677.2924824245565
11085. it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man	who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the	principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth	haverhill and philadelphia	5773.862255463213
11086. the essex merrimack bridge	when first built was not covered	370.8376146341667
11087. as far as we know no american	bridge had been thus protected in 1792	1411.0784601752157
11088. richard s allen is the	authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed	by 1810	1573.209183119149
11089. its original appearance is shown in an engraving published	in the massachusetts magazine in may 1793 which is reproduced	herewith	2828.2241022104786
11090. a brief description accompanying the picture	says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber	1414.2184527494142
11091. between	the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island	there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north	shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of	113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long	7602.021858601818
11092. a	dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place	july 4 1793 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island	2727.440696451538
11093. it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter who was one of the	first share-holders stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the	occasion	4277.829314813361
11094. the essex journal says that he delivered an oration	on the bridge which for elegance of style propriety of speech	or force of argument was truly ciceronian	2849.7088546832656
11095. the reporter must have	written this with tongue in cheek because dexter's oration could	hardly be understood; and although he later explained that he was	talking french it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to	the joys of the evening	6531.277967755562
11096. the north portion of the essex bridge	was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice	what was estimated in the beginning	2716.0275134492613
11097. it stood in its original form	until 1882	250.71971353158264
11098. the southern half however on account of its underbracing	was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation	1557.1184511902225
11099. in 1810 it	was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge	1181.8953024969887
11100. this was built	by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette	county pennsylvania	1263.6197007228823
11101. timothy palmer had general supervision	of the work	252.11156715734063
11102. an advertisement in the newburyport herald	december 21 1810 shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain	bridges	2046.5728630161186
11103. it reads:    information	is hereby given that mr timothy palmer of newburyport mass	has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the	chain bridge in the states of massachusetts new hampshire vermont	rhode island and connecticut so far as relates to the sale	of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges	7942.670343925832
11104. mr	palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if	desired will view the proposed site and lay out and superintend the	work or recommend a suitable person to execute it	3559.3227364458426
11105. john	templeman	approved timothy palmer   this chain bridge proved	less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end	2572.928209651134
11106. it fell	february 6 1827 carrying with it a horse and wagon two men and four	oxen	1423.47879975676
11107. the horse and men were saved but the oxen drowned	561.7998549877915
11108. in spite	of this catastrophe the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened	again on july 17 1827	1878.1175179887682
11109. this second chain bridge was 570 feet long	had two thirty-foot towers and a draw and a double roadway	2595.236664928822
11110. the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 when the county	commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways	2031.968585036475
11111. sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous	use the old covered wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river	at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance	of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site may	28th to june 3rd	7517.484411594849
11112. colonel frederick w lander impersonated	will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott's	hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel	benjamin f kelley's virginia infantry then swarming	through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates	4376.459797369066
11113. he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops- thus the	old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure	secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s	5643.66772732042
11114. the	bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements war fire	and floods as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than	a hundred years	2984.1344214573483
11115. twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction	by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister	3471.3289961453656
11116. it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the	last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic	on us route 250- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike	3773.7347798686583
11117. it is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of	its type to serve a main artery of the us highway system thus	it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days	6319.295461228815
11118. this	covered wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action	in the early morning of june 3 1861 and with subsequent troop movements	of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part	and parcel of the war story	4553.112838278474
11119. so frequently has pictures of the bridge	appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the	old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known	structures in west virginia	5782.90203759112
11120. completed and opened for traffic	in 1852 the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth	and his brother eli of beverly	2169.6221761717443
11121. the chenoweth brothers were experienced	bridge builders and against the competition of other and better	known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of	the covered wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike	a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties	7245.335899023325
11122. the philippi bridge however was the chenoweth master piece	with its 139-foot dual lane span- and it stands today as a monument	to its builders	2606.76518664733
11123. never rebuilt the bridge was strengtened in 1938	by two extra piers a concrete floor and a walk-way along the upper	side in order to care for modern traffic	4653.917007724256
11124. during the war it	was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the	railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior	2735.2492674784203
11125. union	soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the	rain or other inclement weather and some of them left momentoes of their	stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams	6159.486077145355
11126. but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened	when brigadier general william e jones reached philippi	while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may 1863	2857.218134735279
11127. general	jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings including the	long bridge at fairmont and after seeing a great drove of horses	and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men	to work piling combustibles in and around it	7034.589161859825
11128. reverend joshual corder	a baptist minister gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies	to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he	reasoned and argued pointing out that jones or other confederate	commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat	4759.483512827277
11129. jones	relented he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of	livestock was driven up the valley via beverly and across the mountains	to feed and serve the confederate army while jones and his raiders	turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden	7133.603643671934
11130. again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned	to destroy it after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but	for what reason is not recorded nor remembered certainly not because	of pressure from an opposing confederate force	4300.837347123876
11131. on the second occasion	it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their	purpose	2350.9787763977965
11132. centering around this historic old structure a group	of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned	a week-long series of events beginning on may 28th and continuing	through june 3rd to observe most appropriately the centennial of	the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi	4828.462386247608
11133. it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming	pool- eight enlightening vigorous rigorous not wholly unrewarding	years	3499.227341680499
11134. we have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here a	bit about plumbing and pump-priming there	1418.2119930257063
11135. we have had sound grounding	in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy	1412.7846028987456
11136. we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard	birds	372.35342945514054
11137. true our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of	our neighbors have built their own pools thereby diluting our spectacular	attractions	3713.0145714294513
11138. but problems cling to pools as any pool owner knows	373.4556696853273
11139. so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials	errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the	first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience	6058.455638436232
11140. position may not be everything but in the	case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties social andor	physical	1880.2290369460723
11141. we speak from varying viewpoints	22.13189482505351
11142. one of us has a pool set	in a wooded area very near the house	1106.2448006794575
11143. the other has his pool far away	from the house in a field high on a hill	2139.6670333797133
11144. if you are dreaming	of a blue shimmering pool right outside your living room windows	close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of	children damp towels squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated	plastic toys	4310.653240806867
11145. you are likely to be nearer the truth	249.72057747167173
11146. you can	also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living	quarters the greater the chance for violation of family privacy annoying	noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude	3453.9187703843863
11147. on the	other hand out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children	cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the	pool	4472.052910271346
11148. another dilemma: as picturesque as a sylvan pond in	the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being	of a pool	2743.290794765073
11149. yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating	lawn every time the grass is mowed	2375.8221903862445
11150. as in choosing a wife it	is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be	in bad weather as well as in good	2990.3156717076663
11151. in the colder climes for instance	you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when	your pool will hardly look its best	3906.2322227420045
11152. it may be a big hole in the ground	filled with salt hay or an ice floe studded with logs	1896.4082561336138
11153. even a	neat plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold	961.9677813705855
11154. however recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk-	flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the	probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts	3355.7585053948824
11155. naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and	size of your land	2121.16970972979
11156. but if space and money are no problem and small children	are not on hand every day it is certainly more restful to have	your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs	of the house	3957.1986909198304
11157. and a good several feet around the pool should be neither	greensward nor woods but good hard pavement	2358.423763604237
11158. the placement	of your pool however will not of itself solve the two major problems	of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining	to safety	3098.0364609799535
11159. coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself	as well as of your family neighbors friends and anyone you ever	talked to on a transoceanic jet	4105.503773257865
11160. eight years ago while we were	going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period we were	each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings	to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid	out nearby for the lord and master's delectation	4754.107847222031
11161. but not even our	first pool-side	gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies	1184.0239152930635
11162. we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own	backyards	793.930814428505
11163. our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled	395.09169608452316
11164. had we taken a lien on a state park	263.8520487077045
11165. not at all	0.30041514999999996
11166. we had merely been	discovered by the pool sharks	262.77576483052945
11167. we were in business!   from	proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step-	no more than the change from city clothes to trunks	4120.8668287863275
11168. nai^ve of us	maybe but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over	next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling	2866.672795964748
11169. after the first few weeks it was	obvious that rules had to be made laid down and obeyed- even if our	popularity ratings became subnormal as a result	4470.407219149796
11170. so rules we made	in unabashed collusion	93.97189466703486
11171. since our viewpoints in this respect coincided	precisely we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single	social code for pool owners	3694.7066303208303
11172. first and foremost: no one-	no not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations	to his or her own circle	2324.8368279930773
11173. just short of forty lashes we finally managed	to coerce our children to this view	1640.784066808043
11174. their friends and ours are	welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times	1567.3877463031056
11175. no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning	beforehand	1413.980110485201
11176. no ringers either- even if they are trailing	legitimate invitees	375.54733431180756
11177. we want to know when the potlatches telephone	exactly how many they are planning to bring so that we won't	end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august	5318.327967923393
11178. no young children may come without adults except for a specific	organized chaperoned party	934.6908613516977
11179. and accompanying adults are urged to	keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities	1647.733693679169
11180. a gaggle	of gabbling mothers backs to the pool is no safeguard	645.9845701737256
11181. no bottle	pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come	to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk	and run	4831.061303780997
11182. a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood	we designated one day a week as the time	when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours	3001.5172112843925
11183. this has	saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less	brutal to the young less fortunate than ours	3687.242359530609
11184. we also	worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours	early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco	lunch en famille	2967.3059657725207
11185. we gently usher them to an island of tables	and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where	they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides	5305.300061717497
11186. all	dressing must be done in our small bath	house or at the swimmers' homes	1100.807432306608
11187. a dripping parade through your house it is a good idea to have a telephone	extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between	we do however provide a limited	number of extra suits mainly for children and we stock extra towels	and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences	7548.1804705507875
11188. life-preservers the buckle-on	kapok-filled kind are held in readiness too for the very young	944.0244893933041
11189. safety rules of course are more	important than all the others put together	1183.487214135159
11190. in many localities	now the law requires all pools to be fenced usually to a minimum	height of 5 feet	1873.0001899656368
11191. but fenced or unfenced no pool-side is the place	for running or horseplay	1188.848596076162
11192. we allow no underwater endurance contests	either or inexpert versions of water polo	792.7140501062012
11193. diving boards must	have non-skid surfaces		30.112406002561833
11194. and	divers must be enjoined to look before they leap either on top of	someone else or onto a pool edge	2038.426908644777
11195. our pools also have wide shallow	steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus	be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords	4840.948497690174
11196. all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool	and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups	2470.093497088622
11197. when you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend- for your	own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent	3264.5920381069836
11198. you	should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty	pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits	2968.999377556304
11199. soignee pools alas do not just happen	141.22454556111595
11200. they are the	result of a constant and careful contest with the elements	793.2833535705479
11201. unless	you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your	leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity its care and	feeding- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left	to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service	7041.242767626037
11202. of course if your	pool is close to the house your wife can always add it to her housekeeping	chores	1880.3620694129124
11203. or you can make pool care the price of swimming	for teen-agers	962.9785340959846
11204. even so every pool owner in case of emergency	should have some idea of what makes things work	1565.489289730432
11205. a brief course in	hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future	crisis	2123.6721611717617
11206. a sudden high rise in temperature	will turn your pool poison green overnight	783.5996066809196
11207. the	walls feel slippery	4.446123593060657
11208. with or without professional	help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself	unless you have a full-time pool nurse	2606.845909826028
11209. you should see to it	that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter is always clean	2355.285466249098
11210. a pool is no place for a shut trap	262.4821509274174
11211. you should firmly insist	that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water	1883.9269201042275
11212. when shed	they leave rust marks	43.21234916977788
11213. you can hope against hope that come spring	cleaning your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing	and furbishing	2824.960137304589
11214. many hours of spring cleaning	will be saved however if you remove the main drain grate when you	close the pool season in the fall	2616.6246490672174
11215. as the pool is emptied stand by	to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet	2574.303393177199
11216. much of	the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp but requires dynamite	if allowed to dry	1733.8866381872103
11217. if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe you may	easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out	3270.2370847382176
11218. of course when	your 6-inch torrent of water is released it may cause a lot of comment	as it passes through or by neighboring properties	2592.6354182267564
11219. do not forget	this possibility	22.083629660194116
11220. if your pool is located on or near sloping	ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable	than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping	out the water and then scooping out all the debris	4464.059711949977
11221. it may be	true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene but lights also attract	all the insect life for miles around	3267.957720967527
11222. once on the water these	little visitors seldom leave and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming	problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those	present	3214.884732009925
11223. often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light	you need at much less expense	2369.9593073454053
11224. our experience has taught	us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from pipes to	brushes	1566.929232920851
11225. follow pool-care instructions to the letter and be sure that one	person is regularly responsible for each aspect	of the job with no chance for claiming it wasn't my turn	4810.995007542423
11226. never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves-	even if the little boys do want to play space ship	2467.008874298284
11227. you may find yourself	hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running	out even while you are putting it in	3271.4111381594057
11228. draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania	640.5122277469605
11229. any house built now below that line without air conditioning	will be obsolete in 10 years	1878.3967535732086
11230. fortunately it is the fha	which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment	of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired	with a minimum of financial stress	3841.4769818020213
11231. even if you live above that line	the fha will back you for they have decided that the inclusion	of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should	be encouraged	5471.524365381823
11232. new simplified packaged units recently devised	prefabricated glass-fiber ducts and improved add-on techniques make	it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as	little as $600 to $900	3349.40529876944
11233. two men can often do the installation in a	day	564.9608022600756
11234. you can install it yourself- this is a central system that will	cool every part of your house	1567.6482432262833
11235. its upkeep	0.30041514999999996
11236. no less an authority	than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes	possible more than offset its operating costs	2030.546179715786
11237. home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days	of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted	3056.636415286638
11238. we know	now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually	desirable and accurate controls assure the comfort we want	2170.2574433195878
11239. we know too that health is never harmed by summer cooling	753.640544013137
11240. on the	contrary there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills	502.30377873558643
11241. the filtered	air benefits allergies asthma sinus hay fever	394.4293825324973
11242. control of temperature	and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid	942.3565092140791
11243. heart conditions	and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive	heat	1413.323248208303
11244. the cleaner air means	less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry cleaners lighter	loads for the washing machine	2188.8713931531042
11245. the need for reupholstering redecorating	repainting becomes more infrequent	391.8890114119875
11246. clothes hold their shape	better and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words	793.5919237031128
11247. it	will improve your disposition	22.128328431024187
11248. when you're less fatigued things	just naturally look brighter	263.9991757839009
11249. the children can have their daytime naps	and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms	2821.3130067818706
11250. you'll sleep longer and better too awake refreshed and free of	hot weather nerves	947.4247087491942
11251. you can forget about screens and leave the	storm windows up all year around	1417.102253309592
11252. best of all central air conditioning	is something you can afford	503.71736580978484
11253. like its long-lived cousin	the refrigerator a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years	for any	house	2823.131483909875
11254. colonial	or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed	260.188378663454
11255. the	equipment won't take up valuable space either	250.56622738481033
11256. it can go in out-of-the-way	waste space	93.73913843226788
11257. but there's no denying that the easiest	and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning	is when you build	3048.899096640883
11258. if that's done the house can be designed	and oriented for best operation and this can mean savings both in the	size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself	3450.668020752626
11259. if you	can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building	by all means make provision for its easy adding later	3672.8209898013665
11260. manufacturers	have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your	savings over starting from scratch will be substantial	1577.904589726952
11261. if your	house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of	it	2346.7708157831503
11262. this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system	for your regular heating ductwork filters and furnace blower do double	duty for cooling	2471.914874077856
11263. you can get year-'round air conditioners in the	same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or	low boy horizontal or counterflow	4102.937303810186
11264. the units can be installed in basement	attic crawlspace or in a closet located in the living area	1573.2066936972828
11265. the	cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet	392.5837697034172
11266. from the coil	small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set	in the yard garage carport or basement	1876.5190320947247
11267. if you plan to add	cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for	2106.99134846997
11268. be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed	633.8392723449908
11269. they may be inaccessible later	22.065098822307743
11270. be sure your ducts and blower are	big enough to handle cooling	641.2009256297454
11271. this is especially important if you	live in a mild-winter zone	757.0502349523506
11272. be sure you get a perimeter heating system	and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for	heating	2187.6332490626164
11273. you can get a hot water system that will also work	for cooling your house	1649.8309031073845
11274. for cooling chilled water is circulated instead	of hot water	374.283320159709
11275. instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating	units each with its own thermostat	962.0601431207075
11276. these systems are more expensive	than year-'round forced air systems	371.98104601448273
11277. the minimum cost for an average	one-story 7-room house with basement is likely to run $1500 above	the cost of the heating alone	3473.036951220177
11278. if the problems	of combining cooling with your heating are knotty it may be cheaper	to plan on a completely separate cooling system	2323.3311445182435
11279. the simplest kind	of separate system uses a single self-contained unit	757.9427456880669
11280. it is in effect	an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts	to distribute the cooled cleaned dehumidified air where it is wanted	2473.9237623225754
11281. in a long rambling ranch two such units can be installed	one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone	3062.2600807784993
11282. in a two-story	house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first	floor another in the attic to cool the second	2597.6721273686103
11283. in each case having	separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of	permitting individual zone control	2587.07353471883
11284. one of the	more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched	to heating	1572.9690978521394
11285. as you know a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping	the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors	3269.0161580396334
11286. a relatively	simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine	literally runs backward and the heat is extracted from outdoor air	and turned indoors	2748.8562038801997
11287. up until recently this heat pump method	of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when	outside temperatures were above 40 degrees	4052.82994512913
11288. now the machine has been	improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat	at temperatures down to 15 degrees	2463.166314106781
11289. you can get this added heating	feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone	2599.472912216633
11290. consider it as a standby setup at negligible cost for those	emergencies when the furnace quits a blizzard holds up fuel delivery	or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start	up your whole heating plant	4227.7265699106265
11291. how large	a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends	on a variety of factors	2607.8145382364196
11292. among other things besides the nature of	your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from	the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup	of your family	3852.5322321859794
11293. families with children usually don't want the house	quite so cool	753.091459360094
11294. if you are a party thrower you may need added capacity	502.960522270734
11295. the body is a heat machine and 20 to 25 guests can easily double	your cooling load	2129.2756317031117
11296. cooling requirements are best expressed in	terms of btu's	261.60401893826764
11297. a btu is a unit of heat and the btu	rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can	pump out of your house in an hour	4835.743801705701
11298. a very rough rule of thumb is	that under favorable conditions you'll need 15 btu's of cooling	for every square foot of your house	2446.2795882758737
11299. this is if outdoor temperatures	have a high average of 95 degrees	957.221150085322
11300. you'll need more if the high	average is above that less if it's below	937.6061578677603
11301. coolers are also	rated by tons	65.05834390188923
11302. a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by	melting a ton of ice	1260.615477358801
11303. by accepted definition a 1-ton conditioner will	provide 12000 btu of cooling in one hour	1656.4255565456083
11304. you may find	a conditioner rated by horsepower	166.29393832582457
11305. it is generally an inaccurate	method of rating for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor	and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll	get	4634.456639549354
11306. a 1-hp conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness	from under 8000 btu to well over 10000 btu	1573.3143353227356
11307. the	safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit	you need rather than trying to do this yourself	3483.137053858056
11308. don't urge	your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be	sure you have enough	1734.629946410742
11309. better to have your equipment slightly undersized	than too big	560.6841949451986
11310. here's why:   reducing humidity is often	as important as cooling	375.4632517599722
11311. an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly	then shut down for a long period	1884.8081722572824
11312. before it cycles on again humidity	can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature	is still low	1881.9286170032901
11313. with a unit of the right size a compressor will	run continuously during hot weather reducing humidity as evenly as it	does temperature	3478.633142830216
11314. attention to details can	cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately	1426.744343551789
11315. a well-designed 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled	and heated for as little as $128 a year or $11 a month	3060.7305018525603
11316. if you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily your unit	will have less heat to remove	1565.9628245873532
11317. keep the direct sun from reaching the	house and you've won the first battle	1423.7245227786998
11318. in a new house generous roof	overhangs are a logical and effective solution	793.6251252946923
11319. if the house you plan	to buy or build won't have big overhangs you can still do a fair	job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed	trellises fences and awnings	5651.4921987582575
11320. shade trees too are a big help	so keep them if you can	795.4711310679734
11321. drawn blinds and draperies do some good	but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house	3056.6443983481213
11322. the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater	its heat impact	939.9330564654731
11323. the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence	how much cooling you're going to need	2582.159369909573
11324. a shift in the walls	or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more obliquely can	save you money	2328.5680167913933
11325. you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the	sun double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation	2112.639995933062
11326. restrict	large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house	787.0680141132764
11327. they're easier to shade there	22.00729582073551
11328. an attic space above insulation makes	a house easier to cool	503.86504217109393
11329. you'll even gain by putting your water	heater outside the conditioned space and using an electric range instead	of a gas one	3284.209303845209
11330. gas adds to the moisture load	43.167062878237104
11331. insulate weatherstrip	double-glaze to the maximum	64.95569287500909
11332. in insulation the numbers to	remember are 6-4-2	167.54064740045442
11333. they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation	in the ceiling 4 inches in the side walls 2 inches in the floors	3474.462289300774
11334. such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling	installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in	heating and cooling	2334.3126149149184
11335. a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50	per cent	750.8442106264598
11336. it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu	in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary btu	is worth attention	3105.778856282577
11337. you'll foil them in droves along with	their pal humidity by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan a	bathroom ventilator for when you shower and an outside vent for the	clothes drier	5499.122178774592
11338. it's no use pretending	that all conditioners are quiet but the noise they produce can	be kept to a minimum	1879.8304127326405

11341. most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning	559.8863422622046
11342. this is particularly true in site selection	93.8773769947928
11343. you must know before	you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you	must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites	are needed	5180.06813166136
11344. with such a program you can make constructive selections	of the best sites available	945.5096457217426
11345. begin the examination of a site	with a good map and aerial photos if possible	1652.8657662911403
11346. these are becoming more	and more available through the work of counties and other government	agencies	1264.579484411834
11347. the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal	government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural	features of the site	3706.4572437629113
11348. these are inexpensive and available from the u	s geological society washington 25 d c	1103.3120023360693
11349. in recent	years many counties and the u s forest service have taken	aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning	use	4282.12147476026
11350. most counties also have maps available from the county engineer	showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office	showing ownerships of land	2476.0289650756995
11351. inspect the site in the field during	the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for	recreation	3265.858915883601
11352. this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the	climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests	etcetera which vary greatly with the seasons	3361.2465148699093
11353. it is usually helpful	to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location	of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site	4661.340558862287
11354. these	are a great aid for planning use back at the office	643.543862599951
11355. for	site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced	park planner to carry through the study	2825.664083923326
11356. however there is also much	to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are	available and interested in recreation	2584.819872253217
11357. county judges commissioners	engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a	long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions	to offer from their varied professional experiences	5337.773661064391
11358. a visit to the site	by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify	opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area	3215.7652432234827
11359. how much study is required	22.227073396595436
11360. this of course depends on	the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator	and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision	3116.7490731695716
11361. it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick	judgment	of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone	4290.760066613074
11362. usually	there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions	641.4710788789422
11363. a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance	today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little	development or water	4651.661565473992
11364. the same is true of areas which at first look	good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually	be poor areas to develop for general public use	3202.5849427818307
11365. in looking for	the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information	to compare the site with others	2830.597424731938
11366. you need answers to four important	questions	93.31883626567905
11367. what are the existing recreation features	65.84087269220623
11368. how well can the site be developed	94.10200861838557
11369. how useful	will it be to the public	250.42512923506916
11370. is this site available	2.9363008152599663
11371. check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests	already existing at the site	1884.4356442810144
11372. naturally a park site with scenic	views a good lake trees and sand dunes will attract more people	than a nearby area with only trees and dunes	2876.6378910516587
11373. frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different	from the same amount of frontage on polluted water	3034.723421710717
11374. some recreation	features such as scenic values and water interest also have greater	overall value than other interests	1574.4680435857636
11375. one of the most desirable	features for a park are beautiful views or scenery	1414.2519646026274
11376. it may be distant	views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a	small lake colorful rock formations or unusual trees	2616.076027957956
11377. a site which	overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating	traffic	2113.3283894710585
11378. an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf	rolling in on a beach	1415.185110971504
11379. a site may also be attractive just through	the beauty of its trees and shrubs	1653.9095260510185
11380. note extent of these interests and	how available they will be for the public to enjoy	1261.2052165273294
11381. water interest	is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation	site	1900.8474002155792
11382. most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas	499.4005915542228
11383. this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake	provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation	activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports	4823.7266580547575
11384. a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract	the greatest picnic and camping use	1885.4665460470212
11385. it also cools the air in summer	and nourishes the trees and wild life	1414.1015219909484
11386. the amount of water	frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation	afforded by it are important	1879.0157568567054
11387. a restricted frontage may be too crowded	an area for public use	958.710961256279
11388. the quantity of water flow may be critical;	a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant	or dry in late summer	2736.309682497641
11389. if the site is on a reservoir the level	of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be	studied	3271.83720646928
11390. check the quality of the water	43.42157546541595
11391. a stream which has all of	its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation	practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one	passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area	6048.64389303792
11392. other	factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it	supports wave action flooding etcetera will affect its recreation	value	2323.3045610077047
11393. other natural features which can be of high interest	are the forests canyons mountains deserts seacoast beaches sand	dunes waterfalls springs etcetera with which the area is blessed	4489.572111187613
11394. just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which	are of national or state significance counties should seek out these	features which are distinctive of their area	3230.8920029918895
11395. although the site may	not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities	to include them as additional interest to the site	3269.7230038215794
11396. the route to the	park may lead people past them or display views of them	1095.2612083342378
11397. a group of	native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can	be featured at the site	2841.7009627292005
11398. the fish animals and birds which	may be found at the site are another interest	1097.5229175284894
11399. fishing interest calls	for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they	are available and the stocking program of the fish commission	4107.313037065945
11400. animals	may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas	790.0131180926776
11401. the	site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its	own resident bird life	2830.0347691675934
11402. clams crabs and other marine life may add	interest at coastal areas	641.5578239984791
11403. each area has its own historical	interests with which much can be done	1187.0765909593867
11404. park visitors are always	eager to learn more about the area they are in	943.2236640113049
11405. the historical sign	tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the	original historical items or places themselves which still have the	character of the period covered	5174.836633085613
11406. notice should be taken of unusual rock	formations deposits or shapes of the earth's crust in your region	1559.5639646162922
11407. those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area	can add geological interest to the recreation sites	2824.9788792485783
11408. an old shipwreck	a high dam an old covered bridge a place to find agates or other	semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest	3230.8691036015093
11409. some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian	village sites or hunting areas caves artifacts etcetera	2366.0420747999033
11410. how well can the site be developed	94.10200861838557
11411. look at the physical features	of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done	to correct the faults and what it will cost to make the area meet your	needs in comparison to other sites	6434.228956217026
11412. many things need to be checked:	- the size of the area alone can be a determining	factor	865.1868883701815
11413. an area may be too small for the needs of the project	961.3589511216969
11414. areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample	space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges	to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments	3857.6270720111847
11415. acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation	areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical	to operate one large area than several small ones	5489.712047227938
11416. shape	of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the	development	1254.387021728081
11417. a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient	in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width	in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide	5617.166034747844
11418. this	is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your	buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions	2305.5869681185663
11419. however a	narrow strip may be very practical for small developments or to provide	additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail or include	scenic strips within the park unit	4678.0329336173945
11420. the values	of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands	ownership and use of the land and the utilities available there	2723.1594807123356
11421. for	instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national	forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next	to an industrial plant might not	5029.818456776782
11422. the utilities available nearby may	provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the	site	1730.8952641047276
11423. check the	elevation of the ground degree and direction of slopes drainage rock	outcrops topsoil types and quality as well as subsoil	3271.1114862917216
11424. nearly level	areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas ballfields	etcetera	790.2409167502507
11425. determine how much topography limits useful area or what	the costs of earth moving or grading might be	2360.9596562421225
11426. in addition	to its recreation interests water is needed for drinking sanitation	and irrigation	947.5013610686171
11427. the quantity and quality of water sources is	often a big factor in site selection	1644.235972533649
11428. the area may provide good springs	or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines	1572.8426742148808
11429. figure	the cost of providing water to the use areas	559.6976072434511
11430. the	existing plant growth calls for thorough checking	166.44181133160006
11431. look at the trees	as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy	they are the problems of maintenance fire hazards wind throw	etcetera	4469.720284943588
11432. an area may have been partially logged and requires	removal of stumps or clean up	1105.5343040676287
11433. some shrubs may be of good landscaping	value other areas of brush may need to be cleared	2099.5183748337486
11434. the extent and location	of open areas is noted	260.43653539926066
11435. how much will wind	rain sun and temperature affect the use	751.2692540415144
11436. an area sheltered from	strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use	787.6934434109709
11437. the direction	velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how	they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation	of the area	4669.889267034914
11438. lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for	the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable	2168.7529050769617
11439. sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography	or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or	whatever may be most desirable for the use intended	5339.589418482145
11440. some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings	roads utilities cleared land etcetera which may raise the cost of	the site	2322.375474313038
11441. your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his	70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is	accepted with pleasure because i admire the music of prokofieff;	and with sober purpose because the development of prokofieff personifies	in many ways the course of music in the union of soviet socialist	republics	7779.834981614878
11442. the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the	united states of america was gay witty mercurial full of pranks	and bonheur- and very capable as a professional musician	2986.499963745512
11443. these	qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic	haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world	war 1 era	3705.517044881481
11444. prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor	in america was indeed brilliant	374.81979323778796
11445. prokofieff's classical	symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted	and well-trained musician still in his twenties	2828.9636450779226
11446. to the traditionalists	it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the neo-classicists	it was a challenge to the pre-war world	2031.6080013330513
11447. what was it to prokofieff	22.07850432856547
11448. a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-century ideas; a trial	balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant piece	de resistance	2185.998475459413
11449. certainly its composer was an ascending star	on a new world horizon	965.4205953294659
11450. i heard the classical symphony	for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927	1412.4723210911247
11451. all musical paris was there	22.065856604995023
11452. some musicians were enthusiastic some	skeptical	43.99720502919254
11453. i myself was one of the skeptics	141.55746909310068
11454. i remember	ernest bloch in the foyer shouting in his high-pitched voice:	h it may be a tour de force mais mon dieu can anyone take	this music seriously	3100.5893219191007
11455. the answer is yes! certainly	america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously	and with a good deal of pleasure	2828.426843973367
11456. his life-long friend serge	koussevitzky gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances	in boston new york and washington d c to which	he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation	3456.289291158274
11457. chicago was	also a welcome host: there in 1921 prokofieff conducted the world	premiere of the love for three oranges and played the first	performance of his third piano concerto	4840.177539174459
11458. uncle sam was indeed	a rich uncle to prokofieff in those opulent post-war victory	years of peace and prosperity bold speculations and extravaganzas enjoyment	and pleasure: the golden twenties	3115.704428297021
11459. we attended the	premieres of his concertos symphonies and suites; we studied taught	and performed his piano sonatas chamber music gavottes and marches;	we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities	5630.101328336817
11460. we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as	a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers	1888.0373201499356
11461. so young prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland;	in the spacious hunting grounds of uncle sam; in the exciting	salons of his lovely brilliant paris- mistress of gaiety-	excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone color	dance design and thought	4674.7248425296875
11462. meanwhile three great terrible	forces were coagulating and crystallizing	393.8911801299309
11463. in this world-wide conscription	of men minds and machines prokofieff was recalled to his	native land	1254.206378614987
11464. the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts	of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving peoples of the	capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist	tyranny into cringing submission	5176.968540811131
11465. after this holocaust a changing world	occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries new	treaties and governments new goals and methods and the age-old fears	of aggression	and subjugation- hunger and exposure	3874.9020830059985
11466. in this	changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create	for	large national purpose	1875.6835272386609
11467. here this happy roving son of good fortune	proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic	order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world	3341.548659959076
11468. here prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism-	producing music for the masses	1650.2661586523093
11469. it is at this point in his life	that the mature prokofieff emerges	781.3265863305551
11470. one might have expected that	such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative	flair of a composer especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous	4663.828834979768
11471. he accepted the environment	of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his	early promise	1724.5206267948117
11472. by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his	people: i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom but at	the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the	accepted methods of harmony and melody	6437.894016650216
11473. this is precisely what makes	lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must	be new not old	1725.5125538028249
11474. how right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural	defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not	or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism	4990.693165200751
11475. and	with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words- with	torrents of powerful music	1411.7055531216688
11476. compare the vast difference in scope and	beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and	his big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony; or the	love for three oranges with the wonderful imaginative	colorful and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet	the stone flower	7033.363621267052
11477. this masterpiece has gaiety too but it is	the gaiety of dancing people: earthy salty and humorous	1405.07054071429
11478. of	course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived	them	1410.87628155695
11479. the early works were conceived for a sophisticated international	audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way	of life for fellow citizens	2448.4200127630797
11480. however in all of prokofieff's music	young or mature we find his profile- his signature- his	craftsman's attitude	2353.583925297168
11481. prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the	cause of experimentation per se	640.1821613583313
11482. in orchestration he stretches	the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination	for color	2120.9250626660787
11483. his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable	262.34051982333096
11484. his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and	love songs is captivating: witty clever adroit and subtle	2830.9292008788207
11485. his	counterpoint is pertinent skillful and rarely thick	167.23668318381667
11486. also	it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic	modulations the brilliant orchestrations the adroitness for evading	the heaviness of figured bass the skill in florid counterpoint	were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical	dramas of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound	was required	8200.044340276705
11487. that prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes	seem professionally routine to our ears may or may not indicate that	he was less of an original than we prefer to believe	3091.4720021194844
11488. need for	novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability	961.5066815080236
11489. prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of	his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which	the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually	added and integrated	3946.4800384794216
11490. at this date it seems probable that the	name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history	as an effective traditionalist who was fully aware of the lure and danger	of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose; yet	was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics	7955.971866268168
11491. certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared	him to the western world- not his experimentations	1887.4411076915844
11492. so	prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a	rich reward from them	1885.718292262207
11493. nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would	have done better or even as well under different circumstances	1581.4702943586276
11494. his fellow-countryman igor stravinsky certainly did not	139.58471653829776
11495. why did	prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity while stravinsky	dwindled in stature and fruitfulness	1098.197526865927
11496. i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff's own words:	the clarity must be new not old	2586.8639370100777
11497. when prokofieff forged his	new clarity of lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose	he shaped his talents to his purpose	2023.0708128620554
11498. when stravinsky	shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many salons	many dialectics many personalities he tried to refashion himself	into a stylist of many styles determined by many disparate cultures	5485.455379019119
11499. prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own	people- by the compass of their national ideas	2036.83546260488
11500. but stravinsky	was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting	1181.3525891399179
11501. in	all his miscalculations stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder	of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations-	representing many peoples time periods and styles- into his own	music by warping the harmony melody or form to verify his own experiments	4398.367684434489
11502. because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic	materials and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant petruchka	his savage sacre du printemps his incisive les noces-	the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical	direction for which his native talents were predisposed	6931.0203205133585
11503. but	time is running out and many of stravinsky's admirers begin to fear	that he will never find terra firma	1871.7801064645523
11504. how differently prokofieff's life unfolded	14.786017578318683
11505. prokofieff	was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing	world without losing his particular force and direction	2818.068189515937
11506. in the process	his native endowments were stretched strengthened and disciplined	to serve their human purpose	1250.4312626026092
11507. with a large and circumspect	20th-century technique he wove the materials of national heroes and	events national folklore and children's fairy tales- slavic dances	and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his	people well and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large	7138.253122008884
11508. of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical	feat prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind	him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras opera and ballet	companies; choruses chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings;	broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences	4609.282765125819
11509. it	must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many	of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic	security and cultural opportunities incisive idioms social fermentations	for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large	body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose	7353.220060056157
11510. thus	in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced	one of the great composers of the twentieth century	1730.855787611014
11511. that his moods	even in his early years are those of his people does him honor	as his music honors those who inspired it	3678.6020874291657
11512. that he mastered every aspect	of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary	judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous	pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;	and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-century	evidence of the effectiveness of evolution based on a broad	traditionalism for the creative art of music	5881.375312852391
11513. april 10 marked a memorable date in new york's musical history-	indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states	3248.7107771422884
11514. on that date the musicians emergency fund organized to furnish	employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the	depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes	in the stock market crash observed its 30th anniversary	4195.191738040079
11515. roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction	has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth	century especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell	cotman	5189.398714432114
11516. and like this english master mason realizes his subjects	in large simplified masses which though they seem effortless are	in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough	distillation of the natural form that inspired them	4298.8732691714085
11517. as a	boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the	out-of-doors its tang of weather its change of seasons its variable	moods	4268.595690649065
11518. his father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape	painter took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions and imparted	to them his knowledge and love of nature	2869.111992962865
11519. out of this background of	hunting and fishing it was only natural that roy first painted subjects	he knew best: hunters in the field fishermen in the stream ducks	and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of	weather landscape	6711.684096811839
11520. it is this subject matter that has brought mason	a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen but it is his exceptional	performance with this motif that commends him to artists and	discerning collectors	3550.4160110271323
11521. mason had to earn the privilege of devoting	himself exclusively to painting	957.2882440615656
11522. like many others he had to work	hard long hours in a struggling family business which though it was	allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals-	bore no relation to the painting of pictures	4225.546574599764
11523. but it did teach	roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years	he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia	4476.1257104392425
11524. on the death of their father they returned to their home	in batavia new york	1089.5375012668258
11525. after more years of concentrated effort roy	and his brother max finally established a thriving family business	at the old stand	3049.4053721712517
11526. during all this time roy continued to paint	first only on weekends and then as the family business permitted	for longer periods	2187.7404632214857
11527. gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether	and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter	except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions	4512.571203982703
11528. but even	on these the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!	except for a rich friendship with the painter chauncey ryder	who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and	this was limited to a few lessons though the two artists often went on	painting trips together- roy developed his art by himself	5423.520999148801
11529. in the	best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy	and assurance and then to paint	3043.803966325525
11530. he worked in oil for years before	beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition	and early honors including his election to the academy were for	his essays in the heavier medium	3660.977246642355
11531. gradually watercolor claimed his greater	affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive	technique	2113.4102420270106
11532. it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason	on numerous occasions mostly in the vicinity of batavia	1726.935946614977
11533. more often	than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at	a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature	into a composed not imitative painting	5660.811707125064
11534. what i have observed	time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins	as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color	patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;	and that over-all amazing control of large washes which is the mason	stylemark	4899.9371863783235
11535. finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the	job is done	1416.5287304359265
11536. inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable-	no!   but for the technical fact we have the artist's	own testimony:   of late years i find that i like best to	work out-of-doors	3120.2884252578287
11537. first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in	quarter scale in which i pay particular attention	to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest	light the middle tone and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms	of my subject to these large patterns	6783.008716006092
11538. if a human figure or wild life	are to be part of the projected final picture i try to place them	in the initial sketch	2595.017892239416
11539. for me these will belong more completely to	their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage though	i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on	the full sheet when it serves my final purpose	6558.502563889653
11540. i am thoroughly	convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects	nature will do his composing for him; as a result such pictures are	only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before	him	4162.902627462559
11541. just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot	is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting	unless the position serves the design of the whole composition	5786.808897557263
11542. if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain	units in his design often only slightly finer pictures would result	2341.358140261517
11543. out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other	objects like trees logs and bushes can be traced from the original	sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they	occupy the right position which i call 'clicking'	7040.807397179376
11544. speed	in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity	and crispness but unless the artist has lots of experience so that	he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketches	and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition	4831.009777398516
11545. if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition	i mean to project equal concern for color	2586.268434076551
11546. often in working	out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular	passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be	too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed indoors in	a mat	4246.550544919629
11547. when this occurs i make the change on the sketch or on the	final watercolor- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field	4302.688723150621
11548. when working from one of my sketches i square it up and	project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal	2324.633344835673
11549. when this linear draft is completed i dust it down to a faint	image	1419.5052057409853
11550. from this point i paint in as direct a manner as possible by	flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage	2881.9054761282596
11551. however first	i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and	design along the lines i have described	2593.037244716653
11552. then i plan my attack:	the parts i will finish first the range of values the accenting of	minor details- all in all mechanics of producing the finished job	with a maximum of crispness	3636.118047702503
11553. the longer i work the more i am sure	that for me at least a workmanlike method is important	2590.1192338683168
11554. trial and	error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles	in the final painting	1731.8332901185652
11555. as for materials i use the	best available	250.69539512712268
11556. i work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently	resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue	strain	2484.413269941535
11557. in my studio i work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper	unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes	3885.405142566785
11558. i have	used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers but prefer an english	make rough surface in 400-pound weight	1723.1627543332083
11559. after selecting a sheet	and inspecting it for flaws	i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with	clean cold water	2815.0175452643625
11560. then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that	it will lie flat as a board	1418.057349306175
11561. in addition to the usual tools	i make constant use of cleansing tissue not only to wipe my brushes	but to mop up certain areas to soften edges and to open up lights	in dark washes	5763.181969678753
11562. the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that	it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the	watercolorist	2730.8879750611095
11563. i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large	washes in the studio	1416.6854254005768
11564. my brushes are different from those used	by most watercolorists for i combine the sable and the bristle	1578.73935283421
11565. the	red sables are 8; two riggers 6 and 10; and a very large	flat wash brush	2129.346792210845
11566. the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half	inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge	1427.5741353440433
11567. my usual palette	consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson orange raw sienna	raw umber burnt sienna sepia cerulean blue cobalt blue french	ultramarine blue winsor green hooker's green 2 cadmium yellow	pale yellow ochre payne's gray charcoal gray davy's gray	and ivory black	6682.9681369566115
11568. in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason	the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness	yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration	here	3449.5097984778613
11569. true a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis	of nature rather than a detailed inventory	1651.557622009953
11570. unlike many decorative patterns	that present a static flat convention this artist's pictures	are full of atmosphere and climate	1723.1864669709612
11571. long observation has taught	mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes:	a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents	or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the	major motif; and a background usually a silhouetted form foiled against	the sky	7640.322291995573
11572. in following this general principle mason provides the	observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background	and the illusion of depth is instantly created	2749.5630162967504
11573. when painting	mason's physical eyes are half-closed while his mind's eye	is wide open and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression	he wishes to convey	4281.2046630109935
11574. he does not insist on telling all he knows about	any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw	on his memory his imagination his nostalgia	2988.672550461005
11575. it is for this	reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition	of place for their enjoyment	2568.9226407151527
11576. his pictures generalize though	they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms	of weather skies earth and people	2022.2727044930027
11577. by dealing with common landscape	in an uncommon way roy mason has found a particular niche in american	landscape art	2814.5591152404722
11578. living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience	of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor	a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor	the creator of it all	3858.3000082323038
11579. the artist was born in gilbert mills	new york in 1886 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved	to california he lived in western new york in batavia	5173.125987222029
11580. when	i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march	15th i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for	a watercolorist: the water sign of pisces	3860.3000503425988
11581. other memberships	include the american watercolor society philadelphia water	color club allied artists of america audubon artists baltimore	watercolor society	1884.1743003852275
11582. the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts	in the 1960 olympics for one reason- they were better	3026.9607002392418
11583. they were	better trained better looking better built better disciplined h	and something else- they were better dancers	1568.4597789527618
11584. our athletes are	only just beginning to learn that they must study dance	1187.0592952627176
11585. the russians	are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics	789.9415368428429
11586. but why gymnastics at all	22.099677355210346
11587. and is the sport really important	43.315713307153906
11588. after all we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics	competition	1410.1568205080998
11589. but if it is important what can we do to improve ourselves	639.1532433894672
11590. it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem	for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very	important things to learn from gymnastics	5040.835294382133
11591. taking first things	first let's understand the sport called gymnastics	373.8048497200451
11592. it is made up	of tumbling which might be said to start with a somersault run through	such stunts as headstands handstands cartwheels backbends and	culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists	h and apparatus work	6204.919253009072
11593. the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a	common sight in american gyms but about 1930 it was dropped in favor	of games	2303.224112221878
11594. the parallel bars horse buck springboard horizontal bar	rings and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball	volleyball basketball and football	3677.0611485935888
11595. but the russians use	gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because	it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance	2732.208821153904
11596. the	gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination timing	rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection	2119.5773802249505
11597. in short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great	deal of character as well	1584.3006331824415
11598. the addition of endurance training later	when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury	provides that final quality that makes the top athlete soldier	or citizen	5147.444804824596
11599. another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that	it can be started very early in life	1257.2687877698559
11600. could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days	961.9895628549068
11601. in most sports as in most walks of life the angels are on the side	of those who begin young and the russian competitor of 16 has at	least thirteen years of training behind him	3753.035408600031
11602. the american is very lucky	if he has three	394.0354503262321
11603. if a nation wished to get a head start in	physical fitness over all other nations it would start its kindergarten	students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus	eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools	4549.012988070842
11604. first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension	since action relieves both	1651.4356255984808
11605. oddly enough it is proven that there	would be less reading difficulty	638.0796624840848
11606. certainly there would be less anxiety	fewer accidents	and higher scholastic averages since alert children work better	2123.9831402145232
11607. russia knows this and that is why there were over 800000 competing	for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team	2026.8558149132118
11608. eighty	thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself	1403.414788803148
11609. we	could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people	940.9751778421872
11610. and what has dancing to do with all this	390.5276821364002
11611. a great deal	0.20041515
11612. russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous	training on apparatus	1185.1500753570847
11613. well-stretched trained in posture and coordinated	movement and wedded to rhythm they presented the audiences	in	rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic	contest	3207.7549046922913
11614. american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons	253.3563699015393
11615. they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing	with incredible grace	642.869003260492
11616. they were further stripped of old wive's	tales	by seeing the slender lovely russian girls performing feats requiring	tremendous strength h and with not one bulging muscle	4295.263259567364
11617. president	kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation	502.77427265252874
11618. if	we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never	manage it	2120.3393401135554
11619. to be fit one has to start early with young children	and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher	of dance	2750.73768881366
11620. if the dance teachers of america make it their business	to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come	some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much	ahead	5619.616757576123
11621. school teachers all too unprepared for the job they must do	will need demonstrators	940.6397161416111
11622. there should be youngsters who know how to do	a headstand and also how to help other children learn it	2818.0253769583455
11623. they should	know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for	the sports we will demand be taught	1722.283150156422
11624. dance teachers can respond	to president kennedy's request not only through their regular	dance work but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes	for strength and flexibility	4836.221268337108
11625. very little in today's living	provides the strength we need h and nothing provides the flexibility	1261.9108768416786
11626. they often fail however to develop	real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength	1407.2437575722508
11627. ask any group	of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results	considering the amount of physical training they have had will be	very disappointing	2988.4788320033867
11628. even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas	560.4309511256968
11629. this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of	the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once and	that english school girls outdo them in almost every test		2462.2220358683508
11630. the only area in which american boys hold their own	is the baseball throw	1423.5994774268033
11631. for arm and shoulder	strength a chinning bar is recommended	378.979223506253
11632. it should be installed over	a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed	under it a little to one side	4278.949474129172
11633. those children who can chin themselves	should be told to do one chin up each time they pass under it	1879.9928416801981
11634. those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the	top of the chin let themselves slowly down	3276.011870826483
11635. when they can take	ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to	chin up	1565.282831804426
11636. parents should be informed about this system and encouraged	to do the same with the whole family at home	2597.529590508577
11637. arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with	the horse kick	1106.843819363665
11638. start on hands and feet	22.235315255318923
11639. keeping the hands in	the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm	942.1259695904595
11640. after this has	become easy use slower and slower rhythms kicking higher and higher	1425.4162806972408
11641. follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on	all fours kicking as high as possible	2053.0802616136652
11642. push-ups are	essential but few have the strength for them at first	955.8572698665828
11643. start on the	knees in a large circle	166.23876201629182
11644. fall slowly forward onto the hands and let	the body down to rest on the floor	1893.8175325387463
11645. push back up and repeat	14.883581513135818
11646. do this	exercise six times each class period	248.51673346607805
11647. as strength improves start in	a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward	1414.420945548577
11648. start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength	improves fall farther and farther out	2818.1599003775664
11649. try to push back to the stand	position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes	from the hands	1732.4840439006216
11650. the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the	top of the push-up with legs spread wide	2356.4823346196536
11651. let the body down slowly	taking at least five seconds for the letting down	946.4091802506684
11652. five of these	done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up	1889.5073699390937
11653. handstands come after arms chest and shoulders	have developed at least a minimum of strength	1095.2016444874637
11654. of course those	who have developed more will find them easier	750.4704325971245
11655. start with the class	standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended	a little way into the circle	2470.6351699475317
11656. at first each child should do a kick	up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work	alone and those who need help	4299.387851074716
11657. drop both hands to the floor and at the	same time kick the right foot up in back	1576.657206861901
11658. the left will follow at	once	64.78039494931694
11659. the right will land first followed by the left	261.74006979910405
11660. return to the	standing position	22.073396726324408
11661. care should be taken to see that the hands are placed	on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot	is brought as close to the hands as possible	3573.2577369452256
11662. this will prevent flat	falls and toe injuries	249.66339389521232
11663. bare feet are better for such work than any	form of slipper	639.240967474829
11664. eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough	so that the teacher can catch the leading leg	2833.2760126448466
11665. the child should	then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and tighten the	seat muscles	1417.3589745625356
11666. be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the	hands and that only one foot lands at a time	3064.045746683453
11667. the backbend	is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and	as with all acrobatics the sooner begun the better the results	2465.300702452998
11668. have	the class lie supine with knees apart and bent	560.3934946839537
11669. place flat palms on	either side of the head a few inches away from the ears fingers pointing	toward the shoulders	2041.3233222798565
11670. arch the back upwards to make a bridge	249.85341533201003
11671. be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor	rather than toward the ceiling	1734.1746648430933
11672. as flexibility improves the feet will	move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher	1885.4249998593582
11673. later this can	be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover	644.5831441517623
11674. to further increase back flexibility work on the back circle	566.4340195367882
11675. have	the class lie prone	14.781571981064463
11676. place the hands in front of the chest	250.26041891505193
11677. keep	the legs straight and the toes pointed	168.56587895865624
11678. straighten the arms slowly	this arches the back	252.4744941948533
11679. at the peak of the arch tip the head back and	bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head	2193.563027049983
11680. improvement can be	measured by the lessening distance between toes and head	963.547661891345
11681. the last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the	somersault or forward roll	943.3778434415078
11682. this used to be part of every child's	bag of tricks but few children can do it today; some are actually	incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting	or standing upright	5642.436027673874
11683. for most small children learning a forward	roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can	1571.6229868194591
11684. after it has	been seen have the child start on a mat on hands and knees	inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require		3056.062528812369
11685. he places the hands on either side of the head keeping	the chin down on the chest	1418.6482432232415
11686. he then pushes his seat into the air and	the teacher guides it over	1416.4964766139772
11687. one or two practice runs should be sufficient	for solo	376.68500128294164
11688. if however the child is weak overweight or afraid	more help will be needed	1417.7211410474652
11689. when the child raises his seat into the air	the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter	what happens the child's performance will be controlled	3233.279318860657
11690. by lifting	the seat upwards a little the weight is taken off the neck and	the back is kept rounded	2850.809515419637
11691. these are beginnings but correctly	learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed	by a strong flexible body	2175.77959420281
11692. even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal the good tumbler	will be a better dancer a better athlete and a human being with	a greater margin of safety in any activity	5171.1164113068935
11693. it is very important	for parents to understand that early training is imperative	786.935142807187
11694. and dancing	school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also	contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute	even more	3266.8324961572334
11695. every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual	defense	budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion	of these expenditures go for military electronics	3441.823763057929
11696. we have noted how	some electronic techniques developed for the defense effort have evenutally	been used in commerce and industry	2823.731830633435
11697. the host of novel applications	of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because	of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality	2602.596231916767
11698. when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment	the prospect is staggering	1412.666889865752
11699. the author has recently studied	the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this	area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities	2863.9028097619134
11700. the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be	greater by far than any previous medical discovery	2100.253005796135
11701. we use the term	bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology	and medical research	1100.5877933340485
11702. electronics has been applied to medicine	for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine	the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine	4122.302544626461
11703. recently many	doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage	of bruises	contusions and simple bursitis	1408.0726887860471
11704. commonly used electronic	devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit	tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction	along with radiation counters timers and similar devices	4832.742592381632
11705. in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application	of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this	is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates	2727.6879438677324
11706. from the wealth	of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques	perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which	appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely	new tools in medical research	6898.528917865279
11707. many cells bacteria and other microorganisms are transparent to visible	light and must be stained for microscopic investigation	1577.2837398234494
11708. this stain	often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside	1424.7867662617714
11709. a completely new insight into living cells and their structure	will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light	with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv	system to view the results	4062.3912455103246
11710. fig 1 is a simplified block	diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical	electronics center of rockefeller institute	3042.847989901579
11711. by combining the	talents of a medical man dr aterman a biophysicist mr	berkely	and an electronics expert dr zworykin this novel technique	has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding	life processes	3848.9501710389995
11712. three different wavelengths of ultraviolet	radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the	three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources	4301.873540556647
11713. these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the	rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope	1884.8254699777433
11714. instead	of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the tv camera	does the looking	1653.2824307787462
11715. the microscope and orthicon are both selected	to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all	lenses must be quartz	2186.146853810434
11716. the video signal is amplified and then	switched in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which	are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of	a second only one wavelength corresponding to red green or blue is	seen	6468.732107562822
11717. to another the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated	by a synchronous motor	1099.2841783675954
11718. this assembly also supplies a 20-cps	this is the same system	as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded	the present simultaneous system	3896.914763413946
11719. three separate amplifiers then	drive a 21-inch tricolor tube	262.3458182949461
11720. the result is a color picture of the	specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet	wavelengths	2828.339269418447
11721. many of the cells and microorganisms which	are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter	wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum	2332.696145562083
11722. different parts of these cells	sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often	possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color	4285.969840975108
11723. where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows	or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation	into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail	3241.2029093712426
11724. at the	present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is	primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it	2811.21997606133
11725. electronically analyzed	the medical title of lobar ventilation	in man by drs c j martin and a c young covers	a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics	to the study of the respiratory process	4391.05959680783
11726. at the university	of washington medical school the electronics group has developed	the respiratory gas analyzer shown in fig 3	2827.3808549278333
11727. this unit	affectionately dubbed the monster can be wheeled to any convenient	location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's	breathing	2324.3823971517977
11728. in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder	indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper	and lower lobes of one lung the total volume of inhalation per breath	the flow of air from both lobes and the pressure of the two lobes	with respect to each other	7538.0391244949515
11729. usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece	while walking a treadmill standing still or in some other medically	significant position	1877.060425306035
11730. from the resulting data the doctor can determine	lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail	1893.8211543572247
11731. techniques	the original electrocardiograph primarily	indicates irregularities in the heartbeat but today's techniques allow	exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta dimensioning	of the heart and its chambers and a much more detailed study of	each heartbeat	4208.590536032283
11732. for many of these measurements the chest must be opened	but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed	2812.6779032017334
11733. a group of researchers at the university of washington have given	a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques	1893.700525792272
11734. one simple	method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber	tube filled with mercury around the heart and record the change	in resistance as the tube is stretched	5501.500740293081
11735. a balanced resistance bridge	and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed	948.295912692017
11736. sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing	small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel	and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy	5316.223152709487
11737. the travel	time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes	about 16	|msec to traverse 25 mm of tissue	2587.9053370144275
11738. a sonar or radar-type	of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for	body-tissue evaluation	1876.2077345679377
11739. in addition to the heart and aorta successful	measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique	1875.1217237199319
11740. the doppler effect using ultrasonic signals can be employed to	measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel	3030.992544754847
11741. a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining	the effective power of the heart itself	1412.9455987616273
11742. it uses both an ultrasonic	dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor	inserted into the bloodstream	2832.9800315580533
11743. the latter measures the heat carried	away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood	flow	1883.9029663004953
11744. it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer mounted	at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left	ventricle to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself	5332.647913746133
11745. this pressure	measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning	measurement is made	1414.3100874745858
11746. a simplified version of the instrumentation	for this procedure is shown in fig 2	1413.2790795627272
11747. outputs of the two	systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge	followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder	2730.095874863706
11748. from this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure	and effective heart power	1639.9356398874875
11749. several	years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule	which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal	pressure data to external receivers	3225.1813991860413
11750. this original capsule contained	a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm in	diameter	2140.112590135087
11751. battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8	to 30 hours maximum	1094.424680625634
11752. a refinement of this technique has been described	by drs zworykin and farrar and mr berkely of the medical	electronics center of the rockefeller institute	3888.706272817254
11753. in this	novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant	circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing	transducer	2596.159330827888
11754. as shown in fig 4 an external antenna is placed over	or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc	bursts	3913.1935457253944
11755. the energy received by the pill causes the resonant	circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes	place at the resonant frequency of the pill	2994.88046004865
11756. these frequencies	are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst	of transmitted energy and after the pill has been calibrated	precise internal pressure indications can be obtained	4861.792753664166
11757. one of	the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the	patient for several days permitting observation under natural conditions	2460.116309009696
11758. applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are	planned for future experiments	1181.2408936387885
11759. one	of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine	detection is in the exploration of the human body	2019.2374692065314
11760. our readers	are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent	out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects	3693.918136662143
11761. various	methods of pulsing scanning and displaying these sound waves are used	to detect submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water	2323.577646988805
11762. in medicine the frequencies are much higher transducers and the	sonar beams themselves are much smaller and different scanning techniques	may be used but the principles involved are the same as in sonar	5308.480211479318
11763. because the body contains so much liquid transmission of	ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels	1710.9310486447728
11764. bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic	signals	952.8275445172458
11765. based on this phenomenon a number of investigators have used	this method to look through human organs	1410.3243794819616
11766. a good example of	the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers	presented by dr g baum who has explored the human eye	3884.26180437978
11767. he	can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate	blindness due to glaucoma	1105.5151692447218
11768. the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically	is illustrated in fig 6	1188.1450053146214
11769. the transducer is coupled to the	body through a water bath not shown	790.9336803627054
11770. for display dr baum uses	a portion of an f an airborne radar indicator and then photographs	the screen to obtain a permanent record	3706.7807365360723
11771. a typical sonogram	of a human eye together with a description of the anatomical	parts is shown in fig 5	1880.187115208988
11772. the frequency used for these experiments	is 15 mc and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy	lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter	4858.582395914853
11773. the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan just like	a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure is moved over a	90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners	3873.0469360527845
11774. the total	picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector	scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period	3067.8635512989413
11775. drs	howry	and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied	the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have	obtained extremely good results	3092.672150019084
11776. by submerging the patient in a tub	and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on they have been	able to get cross-section views of the neck as shown in fig 7 as	well as many other hitherto impossible insights	6315.013361897878
11777. as mentioned before	bone reflects the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the	spine shows as the black area in the center	2621.23758482237
11778. arteries and veins are apparent	by their black blood-filled centers and the surrounding white	walls	1643.7739906520935
11779. a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in	fig 8 with the various parts labeled	1579.127905034769
11780. oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either	attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a	span of life	3694.6902431949666
11781. he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on	the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august	14 1777	2596.297793568075
11782. his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender	income made it difficult to feed his family let alone educate	them in a town without even a school	4475.878179434269
11783. the two older boys hans and anders	his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a	warm	and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german; his wife	taught the two boys to read and write danish	4210.91442580262
11784. other brothers later joined	them for instruction with oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic	was added to bible reading german and danish in the informal	curriculum	4096.193607662275
11785. oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the	boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned such as	the pastor to supplement the simple teaching	2993.2240185193887
11786. from the town surveyor	hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student	some academic subjects	2137.1850971867198
11787. the mayor of the town taught them english	and french	374.8565560348047
11788. whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed	on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the	village	3471.821796808209
11789. at 12 hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in	the apothecary shop which helped stimulate his interest in medicine	and science	2318.327045265278
11790. his earlier love for literature and history remained with	him for his entire life	1405.6835177149828
11791. in 1793 the brothers decided to enter	the university of copenhagen and the following	spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the	autumn session	2860.433961180216
11792. while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine	physics and astronomy his brother studied law	1879.9229294255506
11793. the brothers continued	to help each other during their studies sharing a joint purse	lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of	their aunt	2978.2268388629645
11794. they supplemented their income by small government assistance	by tutoring and economizing wherever they could	1637.0716815340124
11795. so impressive	were those serious years of study at the university that hans later	wrote to be perfectly free the young man must revel in the great	kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there in which	if he falls it is easy for him to rise again there is freedom	of utterance there which draws after it no irreparable consequences on	society h	5792.717939898749
11796. i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day	overcame a new difficulty gained a new truth or banished a previous	error	3276.4804330217908
11797. he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing	about science	503.90800981445307
11798. in this third year at the university hans in 1797	was awarded the first important token of recognition a gold medal for	his essay on limits of poetry and prose	4819.47014600419
11799. he completed his training	in pharmacy also taking his degree with high honors in 1797	and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with	a prize for an essay in medicine	3761.904126660903
11800. he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis	which later was accepted in chemical practices	1406.4050854616607
11801. activity	han's student days were at a time when europe	was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america	and in france germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms	and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the	continent	4427.257310002962
11802. the new century opened with oersted beginning	his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen	and as lecturer at the university	3704.84306192571
11803. he was stirred by the announcement	of volta's	discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied	the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis	2597.1826803805493
11804. the following	year he devoted to the customary wanderjahr traveling in	germany france and the netherlands meeting the philosophers schelling	fichte and tieck	3480.3169479072617
11805. he also met count rumford	who was then serving the elector	of bavaria and the physicist ritter; these were oersted's main	contacts in science	2464.059677577151
11806. from go^ttingen where he stayed	for 10 days he wrote the first question asked everywhere is	about galvanism	2365.8454650239755
11807. as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass	tubes i have invented i have had quite a small one made here of	four glass	tubes and intend to carry it with me	3661.3786005339307
11808. oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks continuing	their correspondence after he left	2352.114387591625
11809. with ritter he was exposed	to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's	fertile but disorganized mind	1869.8809544565454
11810. oersted remodeled ritter's notes	into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france	for its annual prize of 3000 francs	3674.815698952618
11811. the sound discoveries of	this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize	was never awarded to him	2157.555242426845
11812. in may 1803 ritter in another flight	of fancy wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy	2595.040795806554
11813. he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and	indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided	with the years of important electrical discoveries	2978.6364615473467
11814. thus 1745 corresponded	to the invention of the leiden jar by kleist 1764	that of the electrophorus by wilcke 1782 produced the condenser of	volta and 1801 the voltaic pile	4828.363016946284
11815. ritter proceeded you now emerge	into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 you will have	to reckon	2335.7211475503746
11816. this we might well witness	22.193892941876705
11817. ritter died in 1810 and	oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of	it	1878.0547762089554
11818. in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for	the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably	considered more a philosopher than a physicist	4477.429615856263
11819. however he continued	experimenting and lecturing publishing the results of his experiments	in german and danish periodicals	1421.0101835644618
11820. in 1806 his ambition was	realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university	though not realizing full professorship until 1817	3477.779016654492
11821. during oersted's attendance at the university it was poorly	equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences	1567.9331049417003
11822. he was however fortunate in his contact with prof j g	l manthey teacher of chemistry who in addition to	his academic chair was	also proprietor of the lion pharmacy in	copenhagen where oersted assisted him	5789.439067828428
11823. manthey maintained a valuable	collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted's	disposal during and after his graduation	1887.3619902505652
11824. in 1800 manthey went	abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy	1404.1879187242998
11825. in	february 1801 oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus	and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates	of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates	of zinc and lead	4221.307819533754
11826. in the following year 1803 oersted simultaneously	with davy discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic	battery more than did salts	3477.6861053840375
11827. eager as he was to pursue this promising	line he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy	and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university	that he could devote only sunday afternoons to galvanizing	4223.929240472292
11828. he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and	thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood	3058.9419407239143
11829. the	university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor	represented the upper social level	1588.5401854007805
11830. his broad interest in literary political	and philosophical movements opened many doors to him	1416.4589967613745
11831. his friends	were numerous and their ties to him were strong	498.1356105361726
11832. the years	1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again but on this	visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his	first journey	5153.268805802451
11833. in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws	of nature in german and this was issued in french translation	under the title recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques	et electriques a work held in very high esteem by the new	generation	of research chemists	4690.412801872856
11834. his interest in finding a relationship between	voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated	1648.0312525052275
11835. chapter	8 is entitled on magnetism and in it are included such	remarks as one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces	with the electrical forces	2985.679847864042
11836. the great resemblance between electrical	and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their	laws necessarily would bring about this comparison	3264.4642621392127
11837. it is true that	nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;	but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those	depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest	difference h	4057.895762645515
11838. the form of galvanic activity is halfway between	the magnetic form and the electrical form	1660.2152093836307
11839. there forces are more latent	than in electricity and less than in magnetism h	940.1793630368957
11840. but in such	an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that	the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity	and magnetism were only a difficulty and not a thing which is	contrary to it h	6583.418493824605
11841. one could also add to these analogies that steel	loses its magnetism by heat which proves that steel becomes a better	conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do	3445.8927083310364
11842. it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature as	proven by bruckmann and coulomb	2361.9459396919947
11843. by that one feels that magnetic	forces are as general as electrical forces	795.1885464845891
11844. an attempt should be made	to see if electricity in its most latent stage has any action on the	magnet as such	3273.5884214385337
11845. his plan and intent were clearly charted	93.66790476114983
11846. oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and	political discussions	1415.3203235250587
11847. in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment	as opposed to dogma in another he held that the practice of science	was in fact an act of religious worship	3208.3563061779
11848. he continued as a popular	lecturer	65.11708132670346
11849. he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was	caused to glow by an electric current	1566.5734582789923
11850. in 1819 under royal command	he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm	one of the danish islands being one of three scientists in the expedition	4295.504848386348
11851. it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition	lauritz esmarch that oersted succeeded in producing light	by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric	current was made to flow	4037.8989895580467
11852. together they also developed a new	form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of	copper thereby producing stronger currents	3878.669140911717
11853. esmarch was among those	who witnessed oersted's first demonstration of his discovery	635.3141101348259
11854. of electromagnetism	the association between electric	forces and magnetic forces had been	recognized by investigators for many decades	2359.981886933917
11855. electrical literature	contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and	had altered the polarity of compass needles	1727.9731364907007
11856. in the late 1700's	beccaria and van marum among others had magnetized iron by sending	an electrostatic charge through it	2827.119706201358
11857. beccaria had almost stumbled on	a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge	from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece	of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic	3657.537578953653
11858. the resulting magnetic	effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise	1180.1126280641317
11859. the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but	no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these	two primary forces	2332.7936026512552
11860. oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive	possibly because he had like other experimenters laid the conducting	wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it	4084.9165998718026
11861. the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains	ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the	university related that the first direct event that led to the publication	of oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made	before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820	5281.427520481291
11862. at	this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel	to a magnetic needle	2122.0366877330403
11863. knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and	how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more	profitable for beef dairy and sheep men	3231.634923748298

11866. all comments concerning effectiveness	and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary	medical officer with fda	2582.2289613518196
11867. this article assumes that the	rations you are feeding your beef dairy cattle and sheep are adequately	balanced with protein vitamins and minerals	2323.1199822862986
11868. the drug's	chemical name is listed since most states require feed processors	to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag	3904.7752535842637
11869. in some instances	the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical	name	951.9074880902074
11870. this indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade	name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on	the feed tag	3918.04607966688

11962. additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals are	slaughtered	757.7737010741596
11963. there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle:	fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed	is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;	mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot are filled	by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; special bunks-	as discussed here they permit cattle to eat from all sides	5701.345879236733
11964. feed is	put in with an elevator	140.94869899999884
11965. several materials or combinations of	materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk	1104.665799844624
11966. the selection	of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation	cost of materials available locally and your own preference	3039.180421507104
11967. no	one material is best for all situations	167.88147360381757
11968. selecting bunks by economic	comparison is usually an individual problem	562.5163327895442
11969. animals eat only from one side so the fence-line bunk must be twice	as long as the mechanical bunk	1738.0118479881585
11970. these bunks also serve as a fence	so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence	2597.8940143552604
11971. because	of their location on the edge of the feed lot fence-line bunks are	not in the way of mechanical manure removal	2179.5069915466315
11972. filling these bunks by	the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the	wagons over more time and operations	3273.7895904112247
11973. all-weather roads must	be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all	year	1414.6403881145695
11974. this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall	559.0853225471881
11975. marketing in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties	will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you	have experienced in the last 20-25 yr	3103.652868465956
11976. why	0.30041514999999996
11977. companies of	all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies-	in modern equipment and new processes enlarged r+d	facilities faster new product development	2727.127976373107
11978. many companies have upgraded	their sales manpower and tested new selling distribution and promotion	techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge	3059.9049244617922
11979. given this	kind of business climate what competitive marketing problems will your	company face in the next 10 yr	1731.2876152588092
11980. based on our experience with	clients we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-	the market place itself marketing methods and marketing management	4096.160244317632
11981. there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent	years; there is every indication it will continue	1411.9097268231612
11982. frequently wittingly	or unwittingly price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers	distributors and dealers	1185.2425515360815
11983. despite generally good levels of	income we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling	back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer	2600.1821297326665
11984. here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy	will be on target:   has the probable price situation in	your field been forecast as a basis for future planning	5317.421615848843
11985. have cost	studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might	be done if things get worse	2026.2394575583396
11986. have you actually checked out	different selling approaches designed to counter	the price competition problem	1644.2029434417757
11987. average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding	product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism	of such assertions	1724.384125738005
11988. this problem can force a change in marketing approach	in many kinds of businesses	1409.4122471119836
11989. have you examined this problem of	increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company	1259.3316728701334
11990. need for service is here	to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the	sixties	2814.4023211524213
11991. there are two reasons for this	43.20795111694108
11992. first most products tend to	become more complex	248.29372024609523
11993. second in a competitive market the customer	feels his weight and throws it around	941.7539088733032
11994. providing good customer	service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning	job as the original selling of the product	3071.706012567355
11995. too often it is	thought of at the last moment of new product introduction	938.0494796665707
11996. good	service starts with product design and planning: many products seem	to be designed for a production economy not for a service one	3496.501725895318
11997. proper	follow-through requires training your own sales organization and	your distributor organizations not only in the techniques but also	in good customer relations	2329.420209195345
11998. have you assessed the importance of	wider discretionary	choices for customers	746.9671765433559
11999. the consumer is	pulled in many directions	93.55784477183148
12000. to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type	product- the purchase of which can be switched delayed or	put off entirely- the implications are important	3692.293459226688
12001. your competition	is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers	in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers	of other appealing consumer products	3239.6824963041167
12002. many industry trade	associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share	of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products	3500.8035293297494
12003. has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary	buying area	786.63448633688
12004. the trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts	to the southwest and far west and from city to suburbs	3268.871749186324
12005. these shifts	will continue in the next 10 yr	261.1583676423227
12006. have you considered the implications	of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation	strength of distributor organizations and even plant location	3479.206335181267
12007. we	have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions	in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends	2033.9369646615821
12008. instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger	sales to or through fewer accounts	2363.328982411949
12009. the change may require	different products pricing packaging warehousing salesmanship advertising	and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing	network may have to be adjusted	2720.5756777688266
12010. have you examined these trends	forecast the effects and planned your marketing strategy to compete	effectively under changing circumstances	2600.994073974177
12011. methods	in the area	of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of	trends which have been under way during the first decade	2726.151656457917
12012. as mass dealer	and distributor organizations grow in size there is every reason	to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the	distributor's profits- which is in effect what the sale of private	brands tends to do	6569.151129305494
12013. average manufacturer frequently has	helped build private brand business delivering largely the same qualities	and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded	2330.425923619399
12014. moreover	the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain	stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have	caught on	3891.8587100756968
12015. if you are up against private brand competition	have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening	your market position	2037.0301981437865
12016. if private brand competition hasn't been	felt in your product field as yet have you thought how you will cope	with it if and when it does appear	4480.3414905156715
12017. display merchandising backed by pre-selling through advertising	and promotion will continue to make strides in the sixties	1413.6137237579144
12018. it	has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program	752.9821572288208
12019. how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet	and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are	still important	2302.9738230686535
12020. if you have a higher-quality product how can you	make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken	word	3036.5727443711676
12021. salesmanship is still necessary but it's a different brand	of salesmanship	500.701585081871
12022. have you carefully examined the selling techniques	which best suit your products	967.6877185682845
12023. have you studied the caliber	and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements	for effective marketing	1727.8951760561515
12024. are you experimenting with different selling	higher costs of distribution	some distribution costs are kept up by competitive	pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect	certain niceties and flourishes	5481.308619714696
12025. no manufacturer has taken the initiative	in pointing out the costs involved	640.6361990282322
12026. the use of bulk	handling is continuously growing	248.92402540884137
12027. computers are being used to keep branch	inventories at more workable levels	641.6858322715239
12028. selective selling-	concentrating sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively	by some manufacturers	1656.074377836009
12029. there may be possible economies at any	one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain	1719.9138114958866
12030. do	you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully-	and with some imagination	2129.542051977842
12031. in your sales force will a	smaller number of higher-priced high-quality salesmen serve you best	or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen	2990.8304592180357
12032. will your trade customers settle for less attention and	fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share	2573.8070951911345
12033. in one company	covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men the	president personally phones each major account every 6 mos	2480.077680538904
12034. as a	result distribution costs were cut customer relations improved	555.6104768302588
12035. distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties-	and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study	each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job	3855.76953172708
12036. from the manufacturer's	point of view the increasing cost of advertising and promotion	is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties	3700.880795684984
12037. it is accentuated	by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition	795.4458580705902
12038. how much fundamental thinking and research has your company	done on its advertising program	1418.8179611574105
12039. are you following competition willy-nilly-	trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting	with new means for reaching and influencing consumers	2342.036533195697
12040. have you	evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion	in your total marketing program- from the standpoint of effort money	and effectiveness	4086.426575872053
12041. practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products	on the horizon	501.95216314277775
12042. will you be out in the market place with some of these	sales-building new products	1646.3637548649517
12043. if competition beats you to it	this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store	1412.7709013735848
12044. on	the other hand the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing	the new one is usually mighty expensive	2826.9772399320364
12045. as markets become larger	and marketing more complex the costs of an error become progressively	larger	1253.2194485255864
12046. is your r+d or product development program tuned	in to the commercial realities of the market	1880.9197297730116
12047. are there regular communications	from the field or meetings of sales and marketing personnel	with r+d people	1421.245704473257
12048. technical knowledge is a wonderful thing	but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register	1880.1186507215457
12049. are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd	a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable	estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs; and	translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which	management can act on with some assurance	4765.635671983363
12050. we have seen good new	products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts	and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind	4100.878323243632
12051. in marketing management	there is a shortage of salesmen today	374.86150024034407
12052. in the future quantitative	demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy and	the qualitative need will be greater still	3478.8953429323024
12053. while many companies	have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been	product rather than sales training	2029.5754797169604
12054. nor has the training been enough	in relation to the need	749.522545675343
12055. most marketing people agree it is going	to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements	1094.146066164982
12056. have	you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future		282.7588779369918
12057. has your company developed selection and	training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen	shortage of sales management	with the growing complexity of markets and intensity	of competition sales management whether at the district region or	headquarters level is a tough job today- and it will be tougher in	the future	5191.28730203365
12058. men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager	are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications	called for by this type of management work	4481.738884644465
12059. the growth of business	has outdistanced the available supply and the demand will continue to	exceed the supply in the sixties	2038.54061144187
12060. does your company have a program	for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel	for the longer term	2599.200012156459
12061. does your management climate and your management	compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people	1102.876092462078
12062. every single	problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning	1181.1392200111768
12063. hip-pocket	tactics are going to be harder to apply	261.52243518211037
12064. many food and	beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis	968.9052019286216
12065. with greater investments in plant facilities with automation	growing you can't switch around either in volume or in product	design as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically	3460.8409530962526
12066. are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently	in your company	560.3088998459016
12067. we find too many sales and marketing executives	so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning	1411.8323733600862
12068. are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management	group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the	marketing team	3467.615170339297
12069. do you have a long-term marketing	program	94.52114247870016
12070. the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining	your company's marketing problems realistically	1649.2114438806889
12071. solutions	frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems	whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing	management	2321.687510114686
12072. if companies will take the time to give objective	consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke	then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective	marketing in next decade	5782.573637403517
12073. the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior	designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought	clearly into focus one important difference of opinion	3245.080204183494
12074. the architects	do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently	good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect	and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding	the architectural principles involved in planning the interior	of a building	7007.079814728243
12075. ordinary politeness may have militated against	this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance	in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables workshops	or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject	will recognize that the final boiled down crux of the matter is	education	5208.009939468902
12076. it is true that most architectural schools have five	year courses some even have six or more	2134.100508373951
12077. the element of public danger	which enters so largely into architectural certification however	would demand a prolonged study of structure	1893.5173203683921
12078. this would naturally	lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior	designer's training	1890.699942980183
12079. we may then dismiss the time difference	between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior	design student as not having serious bearing on the subject	3118.0380750701966
12080. the	real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what	is their value as training	2601.815779156687
12081. the american institute of interior	designers has published a recommended course for designers and	a percentage layout of such a course	2041.4444431888726
12082. an examination of some forty	catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design for the most	part schools accredited by membership in the national association of	schools of art and a further on the spot inspection of a number	of schools show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations	7434.435756560019
12083. one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but	the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to	the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions	3852.1806769792843
12084. the suggested course of the aid was based	on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to	curricular necessities	3695.430618773241
12085. obviously the four year provision limits this	to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated	1251.8273048352094
12086. without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture	versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs	of the interior designer	3487.8751813170757
12087. to begin with what is an interior	designer	167.40119323791453
12088. the dictionary of occupational titles published	by the u s department of labor describes him as follows: designs	plans and furnishes interiors of houses commercial and institutional	structures hotels clubs ships theaters as well as set	decorations for motion picture arts and television	6662.567070292757
12089. makes drawings and	plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor coverings wall	decorations and determines color schemes	1576.4831865655358
12090. furnishes complete	cost estimates for clients approval	139.94841614142692
12091. makes necessary purchases places	contracts supervises construction installation finishing and placement	of furniture fixtures and other correlated furnishings and follows	through to completion of project	2602.9001021807903
12092. in addition to this	the u s civil service bureau when examining applicants for	government positions as interior designers expects that when various	needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them	5629.7193818350925
12093. he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture	of any craft materials needed in the furnishings	1727.7251043247775
12094. this	seems like a large order	65.22274884606544
12095. the interior designer then must first be	an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and	plumbing and finance	2038.3287795938772
12096. yet nobody will question the necessity of all this	and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice	it	3253.6739158391583
12097. and further he must understand his obligation to the client	to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve	his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society	3666.4123398678266
12098. few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording	of their curriculum	1889.5340007934526
12099. it is in the quality of the teaching of all this	that a question may arise	1242.8365468390268
12100. the old established independent art	schools try their best to fulfill their obligations	1183.7207070920704
12101. yet even here	many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with	a floor plan and the simple command- design a luxury apartment;	no description of the client or his cultural level no assertion of	geographical area or local social necessities- simply a luxury	apartment	4853.7206470443925
12102. working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only	in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may	please the public relations department but have little to do with the	essence of interior design	6075.356022773028
12103. it is possible of course to work	on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will	explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel	of real interior design demands	3670.901545961947
12104. unfortunately the purely synthetic	problem is the rule	252.93494257347456
12105. it is like medical schools in india where	in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead	bodies is frowned upon	2167.918109288714
12106. instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs	of plants	564.4024682125039
12107. thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense	of actual experience	504.36265391734815
12108. in the earlier years of training certain	phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its	use	3064.5328586816795
12109. but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable	504.45470830341463
12110. consultation with architects clients real estate men	fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development	of class problems just as in actual work	4112.40748794784
12111. fortunately although	only a few years ago they held the student at arms length today	the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only	from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from	the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of	tomorrow- that the student already is in the trade	5437.320534529879
12112. even	the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from	photographs and lantern slides	1645.6080118388884
12113. here too the reality of actual furniture	must be experienced	372.0819479890302
12114. the professional organizations such	as american institute of interior designers national society	of interior designers home fashions league and various trade associations	can and do aid greatly in this work	4837.192516699658
12115. certainly every educator	involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework	of one of these organizations	1888.4925045749048
12116. not only should every educator	above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of	the professional organizations but his first qualification for membership	as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership	would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject	7117.184607208353
12117. participation for the educator in this case however would have to	be raised to full and complete membership	1556.8586887859674
12118. the largest of these organizations	at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the	conduct and standards of the group and indeed refuses him even the	right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog	6601.291775808108
12119. this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower	his standing in the eyes of the students	1572.230561758061
12120. the professor in turn	dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in	the policies and standards of which he has no voice	4098.337123591382
12121. this seems	somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications	for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced the	educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands	3448.6180985983474
12122. in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to	the schools	1192.6315547414115
12123. that is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses	in their membership requirements	786.9342404498647
12124. when these groups were	first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have	had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were	rare and	undeveloped during their youth	4981.784854217725
12125. long hard years of on the	job training had brought them to their competence	941.9174970381249
12126. the necessity	of that day has long disappeared	251.10756001884766
12127. there is plenty of opportunity	for proper education today	259.36068414150384
12128. it is discouraging for students to realize	that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they	are supposed to stand	3468.7517570814716
12129. the reason and the day of grandfather	clauses has long since passed	637.9968557561509
12130. no one can deny that these back	door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused	nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents	to membership in supposedly learned societies	5457.40416953807
12131. beyond	any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality	of the teachers themselves	1411.583756051283
12132. it will occur to anyone that the teacher	must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far	beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication	to his subject and to his students	5775.941642504276
12133. the local decorator who rushes	in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these	qualifications	2018.7460762535084
12134. nor will the hack the jack-of-all-trades still	found in some of the smaller art schools suffice	1881.0255631722557
12135. only a	few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher	of interior design	1586.8525313229197
12136. at the end of its letter was the information	that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume	design and advertising art	3866.1199444348554
12137. this kind of irresponsibility toward	their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude	in the future designer	1574.6799599242547
12138. we must build a corp of highly professional	teachers of interior design who have had education experience	in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments	of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres	6191.1422575309125
12139. considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture	furniture design textiles and color is also desirable	1261.6949373013829
12140. in all degree courses in interior design a number of academic	or general studies courses are included	2132.0896511007036
12141. it is only fair	to demand that teachers of courses in english history psychology	and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior	design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects	4027.9844244995315
12142. the	proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only	if this standard is observed	2369.3343749806645
12143. the matter of sympathy of the academic	professors for art objectives also must be taken into account	1415.0606737315334
12144. one technical question of school organization comes to mind here	561.4930908283275
12145. for	proper accreditation of schools teachers in any course must have	a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate	2725.3423036227305
12146. since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate	work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed	3271.0326895305525
12147. indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable	schools of art have granted degrees at all	2163.532744260651
12148. the question however	cannot be ignored for long	250.5026597637314
12149. the basic problem involved is that a college	setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty	for the advanced degree	2330.116282561455
12150. most professors in the course must naturally	again have a higher degree than the course offers	1893.92130958442
12151. one solution	is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute	1092.1998768033704
12152. it is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it	959.5914608744846
12153. this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general	785.1152224523098
12154. only the independent art schools that is those not connected	with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation	before accreditation by the various regional organizations	4288.864524926348
12155. it has	been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation	for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of	their fine arts department	3086.2344457782187
12156. this plus the habit of many schools of	simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics	department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior	design has contributed to the low repute of many university courses	in interior design	6562.8441550065345
12157. in spite of this many universities offer adequate	and even distinguished courses in the subject	1107.2024323365158
12158. there will be	no mitigation of these offences until all art schools whether independent	or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do	medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the national	association of schools of art	6207.644029993404
12159. independent art schools	granting degrees must naturally follow this with academic accreditation	by the appropriate regional group	1411.09644410882
12160. how long has it been since you reviewed the objectives	of your benefit and service program	1881.0656275142628
12161. have you permitted it to become	a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee	morale and consequently increased productivity	2471.7768889903928
12162. what	effort do you make to assess results of your program	753.0976823169469

12224. if you have an annual or regular	physical examination program is it worth what it is costing you	2365.9781432446716
12225. consider what you can afford	to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee	benefit program	2025.1646299887077
12226. too many plant officials are all too eager to	buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works	for another plant	3690.1509697404967
12227. but even if that other plant employs the	same number of workers and makes the same product there are other facts	to consider	2322.7111060326365

12231. are	you in a rural or urban area	167.08436086891066
12232. these factors can make the difference	between waste and efficiency in any benefit program	1404.50559868326
12233. above all	don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good	will	939.1745104760545

12235. aim to balance your employee benefit	package	93.13457834563356
12236. some plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal	retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere	2607.2949841089976
12237. they're	asking for union trouble	14.84684060693867
12238. if you want credit	for your employee services program let your workers know what they're	entitled to	2107.363627076366
12239. encourage them to exercise their benefits	43.77716652109471
12240. this	can be done by stories in your house organs posters special	publications letters to workers' homes as well as	by word of mouth through your chain of command	4625.970100763535
12241. some companies	find a little imagination helpful	93.42672621740252

12246. have	the insurance company or your own accounting department break down	the cost of your insurance package periodically	2354.8838072488165
12247. you may find certain	coverage costing much more than is economically feasible thereby alerting	you to desirable revisions	1579.893903149907
12248. check to see if some of your	benefits- such as on-the-job disability pay- can be put on a direct	payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you	4840.264339525851
12249. use deductable insurance wherever feasible	14.697416020345212
12250. it can put an end to marginal	claims which play havoc with your insurance rates	1641.2856542729903
12251. also beware	of open-end policies especially in the medical field	374.90252625499886
12252. this will mean	that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will	go up in like manner	2823.081412429354
12253. put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits	43.40577775093389
12254. don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death	752.6588480867794
12255. generally your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that	protect him during his working life or during retirement	1414.9280249432875
12256. off	in granting bereavement leaves specify the maximum time off	and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify	3479.6991944290794
12257. thus you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth	cousin's funeral	939.6097731844042

12261. if coffee is sold at the cafeteria	let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group	1877.8406631403327
12262. consider	installing supplemental serving lines in production areas	250.23666875064313
12263. make	sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers	if you are supplying the coffee	1879.210296255837
12264. otherwise you may be saddled	with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers	1184.232734541431
12265. keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool	and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company	2743.1668443563412
12266. and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest	possible age	1653.195671193977
12267. make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements	tied into your pension plan	945.3716660923499
12268. younger men usually don't think	of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're	liable to change jobs several times before settling down	3879.305206791196
12269. choose	carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans	167.37605365965607
12270. there are two sides of a coin for this decision	558.7776355144097
12271. workers usually think	more of a plan they contribute to	374.4175780803037
12272. and they can at least collect	the money they put in plus interest when they leave the company	2344.0512998975387
12273. a	non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he	retires	787.648316762987
12274. thus there is an added incentive to stay on the job	754.0276069278007
12275. make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee	would not otherwise be working	1410.4001397964946
12276. these include: leaves of absences	illnesses and layoffs	248.2484133106954
12277. consider adopting a system of holidays	in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience	to the operation of the plant	2461.2418682203734
12278. it's usually not too hard to sell	workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods	2105.3783909138283
12279. for example	the friday after thanksgiving can be substituted for washington's	birthday	639.7390443328698
12280. this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and	startups	558.1166065044574
12281. require each employee to work his last shift both	before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay	1732.0923994367574
12282. this cuts the absentee	rate	22.238778150167327
12283. consider using vending machines	rather than subsidized cafeterias	165.25518319475498
12284. latest models serve hot meals at reasonable	prices and at a profit to you	1418.4776604299375
12285. if a concessionaire runs the	cafeteria keep an eye out for quality and price	940.367011195501
12286. if the soup tastes	like dishwater your employees won't blame the concessionaire	970.5102899965593
12287. check your cafeteria location to make sure	it's convenient for most employees	638.5278709816856
12288. you may save valuable production	minutes with a change	393.20903516651293
12289. spread your vacation period	over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two	weeks	1728.2212792699897
12290. this will cut the expense of vacation replacements	250.8208169467964
12291. and with	the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice	vacation dates	1570.0739935322329
12292. also make sure you have reasonable requirements	as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a	vacation	2838.828816707543
12293. you might try providing standard vacation time off but make	the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous	year	2462.0846621467444
12294. the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into	a new era	1412.278059774818
12295. modern times have changed the world beyond recognition	167.98894127957004
12296. the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away	752.2360085474878
12297. but with	all the changes in philosophy dress and terrain- a few things remain	constant including the devotion of americans to the great field	sports hunting and fishing	2989.635369232833
12298. as the generations move on clothes	become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports	1646.3663355007725
12299. sporting	firearms change markedly for the better	94.10593155195001
12300. just as modern transportation	has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon the demand of	today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment	3683.1210520605628
12301. the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through	diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle	loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders	extremely accurate bolt lever and slide action firearms	3662.0008643235515
12302. and	millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition	designed for today's hunting and target shooting	2344.0927122218663
12303. and due	to modern resource-use and game management practices there is still	game to shoot even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and	water	2462.5709577625444
12304. present conservation practices regard wildlife not as an expendable	natural resource but as an annual harvest to be sown and also	reaped	3285.4394035548626
12305. unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states	on shooting preserves	for five and six months each year	2170.634759532634
12306. close to two million	game birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting	preserves and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas	during the 1960-61 season	4295.037789641042
12307. the shooting development program of the	sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers' institute has successfully	published these facts in all major outdoor magazines many national	weeklies and the trade papers	3123.4389024945954
12308. the most effective way to	develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly	managed shooting preserves	2819.2498541976624
12309. this has been the aim of the director	of the shooting development program the new york staff of the sportsmen's	service bureau and the saami shooting preserve	field consultants since the start of the program in 1954	3942.820607844368
12310. following	the kick-off of saami's shooting development program	in 1954 a most interesting meeting took place in washington d c	2811.0563131291933
12311. the group known as the american association for health physical	education and recreation	initiated a conference which brought together representatives	of the national rifle association saami and the american	fishing tackle manufacturers	3463.84505967016
12312. this meeting was called to	determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as	the outdoor education project	3043.2812355153706
12313. the outdoor education project	took cognizance of the fact so often overlooked that athletic	activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship	to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life	3848.97463303086
12314. the	various team sports assuredly have their place in every school and	they are important to proper physical development	2577.339203910391
12315. but with the exception	of professional athletes few contact sports and physical education	activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of	the average american man or woman	3322.0729831651506
12316. following a vigorous campaign	of interpretation and leadership development by oep director	dr julian smith today thousands of secondary schools colleges	and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical	education and recreation programs	5622.16592960677
12317. saami's financial support	since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education	1094.97248459066
12318. personnel assigned through the shooting development program have	proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops at which	hundreds of school administrators teachers professors and recreational	leaders have been introduced to outdoor education	5464.789434900201
12319. considering	that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths the project	and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more	to reach	2606.2497889444926
12320. in 1959 saami's shooting development program	announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys	and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in	the shooting sports	4987.982635957826
12321. this program is now nationally known as teen	hunter clubs	375.9459889729015
12322. teen hunter clubs were initially sponsored	by affiliated members of the allied merchandising corporation	1407.4553876867399
12323. the first program was sponsored by abraham + strauss hempstead new	york under the direction of special events director jennings	dennis	1208.624917773588
12324. other pilot programs were conducted by a + s babylon	new york; j l hudson detroit; joseph horne pittsburgh	1470.302556515632
12325. other thc activities followed conducted by shopping	centers department stores recreation equipment dealers radio-tv	stations newspapers and other organizations interested in the	need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting	firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations	related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources	5063.700157571422
12326. saami's	field men have served as consultants andor have participated in	75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic	young americans	3689.87937064468
12327. through the efforts of saami's	shooting development program these shooting activities and many	others including assists in the development of public and privately	financed shooting parks trap and skeet leagues rifle and pistol marksmanship	programs have been promoted to mention only a few	4462.414908474386
12328. the	continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will	assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made	aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities	for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand	6420.364628216814
12329. while individual	sportsmen are aware of this situation too many of our political	social educational and even religious leaders too often forget it	2322.7328217025897
12330. help	is needed from dealers at the grass-roots level	393.62828246345117
12331. the american	gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program	through their industry trade association	1263.9575816848815
12332. since saami's	conception in 1926 and more specifically since the adoption of the	shooting development program in 1954 millions of dollars and promotional	man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot	for more youths and adults	6186.248834445769
12333. we trust that you as a gun and ammunition	dealer have benefited through additional sales of equipment	1422.2393144282855
12334. are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports	393.1450496045885
12335. are you looking	ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and	girls who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life-	ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent	ammunition	4126.139074126109
12336. is your	sporting firearms and ammunition department	primed for the expanding horizons	964.0156154110853
12337. would you like to	organize teen hunters clubs shooting programs and have information	on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags	on shooting preserves	2836.4466687895188
12338. ask sammy shooter	0.30041514999999996
12339. we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in	that land of pirates seagulls and bluefish on north carolina's	famed outer banks	2585.5314991889477
12340. this beach campground with no trees or hills presents	a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual	use	3038.0961347117536
12341. with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety	of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now	2039.3797535783972
12342. there were	umbrella tents wall tents cottage tents station wagon tents pup	tents pop tents baker tents tents with exterior frames camper trailers	travel trailers and even a few surplus parachutes serving as	sunshades over entire family camps	6057.538510152562
12343. moving around camp we saw	all kinds of camp stoves lanterns coolers bedding games fishing tackle	windbreaks and sunshades	1736.671791134299
12344. we saw similar displays in the other	three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long national seashore recreation	area	2113.150555122711
12345. dealers would do well to visit such a campground often look	at the equipment and talk with the campers	1723.4840998310112
12346. here you begin to appreciate	the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry	1654.5332342467634
12347. camping is big and getting bigger	43.508047691096685
12348. no one knows where it will	stop	140.7154996575735
12349. almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement	of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of	all outdoor markets	2586.194600589439
12350. you read various guesses on how many americans	are camping	559.9598482380022
12351. the number depends on who is talking at the moment	373.5170001060317
12352. the	figures range as high as 15 million families	397.2055799615681
12353. i've heard 10 million	mentioned often but i'm more inclined to think there may be a	total of some five to seven million families camping	2589.9797128946184
12354. seven million families	would total 30 million americans or more	568.8062335975019
12355. consider the equipment	needed to protect this many from the weather to make their cooking	easy and their sleeping comfortable	1887.0223213163558
12356. harassed state park officials often have more campers than they	know what to do with	1644.7786211506857
12357. they are struggling to meet the demand for camping	space but families are being turned away especially on holiday	weekends	1887.007093693317
12358. the national parks always popular camping places are facing	the same pressure	962.4156910290325
12359. the national park service hopes by 1966 to	have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day- almost	twice what there are at present	2449.198353988012
12360. the u s forest service cares	for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests	and is increasing its facilities steadily	3465.868795948416
12361. but the campers still	come	14.749967569285204
12362. they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding	761.0531505061591
12363. they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits	371.7908764240325
12364. they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing	numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation	that becomes a family experience of lasting importance	4976.385701496894
12365. keep coming	there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for	the migration to the campgrounds	1416.3289674152054
12366. among them according to the u	s department of commerce are:	higher pay	earlier retirement and more education	2350.008723163228
12367. the more people learn about	their country the more they want to learn	791.4001984335345
12368. camping is family fun	and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever	saw before	2817.7050275726547
12369. but make no mistake about it the first reason	people turn to camping is one of economy	1410.1570797064758
12370. here is the promise of a vacation	trip they can afford	751.7887474656657
12371. the american automobile association	computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile comes	up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29	2452.879070538368
12372. the aaa	then splits it down this way: $10	393.3909618228966
12373. 50 for lodging	$7 for gas and oil and $2 for tips and miscellaneous	947.9489792971665
12374. what does	the camping couple do to this set of figures	746.1499457522494
12375. the $9	0.20041515
12376. 50 for lodging	they save	22.030844930873226
12377. because they prepare their own meals they also keep in	their pockets a good portion of that $10	1571.9619937384878
12378. 50 food bill along with most	of the tip money	562.9199719202895
12379. the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing	cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping	along the way	2190.8931903572934
12380. where americans used to think of a single	vacation each summer they now think about how many vacations they	can have	3034.62668827128
12381. long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or	four days several times a year	1571.2450595385956
12382. and even if they stay in resorts part	of the time they might if the right salesman gets them in tow develop	a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip	into the wide open spaces	6168.381949904708
12383. it would be a mistake to sell those	thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts	of home	2027.0833182628721
12384. home is the place to find the comforts of	home	559.5405457346321
12385. they're buying fun and adventure and family experiences	166.79644603815137
12386. but	it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable	camping has become	2103.8525370999873
12387. this is no longer a way of life for the bearded	logger and the wandering cowboy	1253.8227228451915
12388. today's campers want comforts and	they have them	249.0323425300597
12389. and this helps explain why so many people are now going	camping	640.3755413344569
12390. it's fun and it's easy- so easy that there is time	left after cooking and tent keeping for the women to get out and	enjoy outdoor fun with their families	4824.623361150528
12391. camp meals are no great	problem	43.8336275863135
12392. neither are beds thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags	561.4715809209101
12393. neither are shelters because there is one to meet the needs of every	camper or prospective camper	1422.2010460837776
12394. but there is still the sometimes	complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for	their individual needs	2580.9201099110237
12395. throughout history the man who showed superior performance has become	the commander of others- for good or bad	1574.1160598234094
12396. since the industrial	revolution when factories emerged this classical pattern has been	followed	1180.3937845630953
12397. there have always been tales	of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator	willingly or not and found he didn't like it; the scientist	who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more	commonly in recent years the engineer who found that other duties interfered	with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions	5201.336816464529
12398. there	have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into	very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work to their own and	the public's dissatisfaction and loss	4678.970616059325
12399. this has been more	evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased	technology	790.6484433512335
12400. the remedies have been many and varied- attempts to	teach management techniques- either in plant at special schools	or	in university crash courses- provision of management-trained assistants	or associates	4667.081639773811
12401. but the realization has been growing that	these are not the complete answer	788.7921215008122
12402. some men have no talent for or	interest in management; forcing them into management can only create	trouble	2362.8309380180103
12403. the old shop adage still holds: a good mechanic is usually	a bad boss	943.1665114811445
12404. yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition	of managerial status as the gage of success	1651.7979000803668
12405. labor fights to	change its collar from blue to white	372.4778704633924
12406. all grades of management seek	more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures	1411.0025054733405
12407. as several	recent books have over-emphasized we have become the most status-conscious	nation in the world	1262.272955110885
12408. what can be done for	the individual contributor who is extremely important- and	likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented	company	4091.320033447798
12409. he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and	outside; usually concerned about america's belief that attainment	and success are measured in dollars and titles	2854.306314896876
12410. yet titles are traditionally	given only to management men and income tends to rise with	title	1886.5478193213553
12411. even the college professor in america has been affected	262.56961930569855
12412. it is as one engineer says indeed a difficult thing for the	engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he	could employing managerial skills	5031.378875403599
12413. this difficulty arises even though	we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course	1413.4868792486357
12414. this	leads one to conclude as you have that there is inevitably more	prestige in a management position in the minds of our people	3681.3661043209104
12415. nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than	engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers	1569.5155652378992
12416. so we asked such	men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on	the dual-road-up problem- and more importantly- their solutions	3910.8695453475657
12417. in the paragraphs that follow we quote from 32 men who are identified	on the final page	1410.0451341756684
12418. among	the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of	general electric	1182.6978120050867
12419. this is not a mutually exclusive plan; there	is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the	technical or the managerial path upward	3131.8979778580265
12420. further the management path	does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by	the more technical path	2824.049009863039
12421. it is common to shift back and forth working	up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions	1578.2329787789247
12422. actually there are a number of individual-contributor	positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services	operation that are filled by men with successful managerial	experience who are currently broadening their capabilities	5322.1990047013405
12423. also	moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's	recognition as a technical expert	1427.81753850022
12424. as examples at ge: glen	b warren formerly manager of the turbine division widely recognized	as a turbine designer	2584.2270376944975
12425. the late w r g baker a pioneer	in television design and long-time vp + gm of the electronics	division and later by his own choice an individual consultant	2147.0033157197627
12426. harold e strang expert in switchgear design for a long period	vp + gm of the measurements + industrial products division	and who currently approaching retirement is vice-president and consulting	engineer in the switchgear + control division	2464.1765056059057
12427. in	the ge plan a number of individual contributors have positions	and compensation higher than those of many managers	1717.134249666927
12428. these positions	carry such titles as:   consultant- advanced development	consulting engineer   consulting engineer- heat transfer	consulting electrical engineer   senior electrical	engineer   senior physicist   westinghouse has a similar	system with two classifications representing various levels of competence	on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist	as the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist	7895.372859117682
12429. many	companies have systems particularly in r + d which work more	or less well depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on	the part of administration as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent	quotations	2951.2077935078555
12430. another factor that may hold hope is for parallel	recognition is as one man says it: h that the fad for educating	top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically	trained approach	5516.713530418747
12431. one company instituted	early in 1959 a vertical classification system consisting of four	levels	942.1434670484969
12432. there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;	the top non-supervisory level senior staff engineer enjoys status	and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision	4995.337034336548
12433. the second level senior engineer rates slightly below first-level	supervision	373.78283943475105
12434. the expectation is that first-level supervisors will	be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third	engineering level with very few coming from the first level	4479.617119010915
12435. the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for	non-supervisory engineers but probably not into executive levels	1743.3426804763633
12436. in this organization about half of the engineers with 15 or more	years of employment are in supervision engineering or elsewhere	3065.840885999818
12437. this	reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which	are not military	942.7357698537351
12438. several other examples:	we have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering	department headed by a chief engineer	2817.353661003737
12439. we have set up a central r	+ d department as well as engineering-management departments-	about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants	1919.0172341227008
12440. a separate research department is of course confined to new or future	designs	1176.649351906221
12441. part of this headquarters staff however are engineering	managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters	management	1564.6028786990134
12442. these headquarters engineers headed by the vice-president-	engineering counsel and advise divisional managers and chief	engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are	engineers who have been advanced from the divisions	5785.519710056143
12443. these men are	considered managers of engineers	93.27142815070216
12444. they must learn to wear several hats	so to speak working with management sales and engineering problems	related to the product	3053.74370973645
12445. we do not have people in our organization	termed 'consultants' or 'fellows' who are specialists	in one particular technical subject	1883.0746074789786
12446. i suppose it is because we are	just not big enough	753.7896401865996
12447. we have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers	retained and called in on certain problems	944.5493098711286
12448. the only 'fellows'	in our company are those who have been honored by asme aiee	or aiche h i am sure that the engineer who enters	management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities	than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider	accountability	7318.868548168675
12449. we have tried to make both	paths attractive so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction	in either	1729.256717405151
12450. one way to formalize this is in the job structure	561.9057435205383
12451. we have these positions which compare directly: f   above	these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president	of engrg r + d	1683.1403574143733
12452. this approach	has not been entirely satisfactory	93.25828033035063
12453. the primary deterrent appears to	lie with the technical people themselves and their concept of what	constitutes status in present-day society	3042.0459579112344
12454. a serious problem	accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly	defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level	3046.6924369045346
12455. with no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the	next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless	of performance h promotion is too often based on longevity and	time in salary grade instead of merit	4454.566640526148
12456. if no specific organization	plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level	the result is a department top-heavy with high-level high-salaried personnel	3912.3964897595156
12457. we have two approaches	for the technical man: the position of staff engineer which	is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative	organization to take the routine load away from department managers	and project engineers as much as possible thus allowing them more time	for strictly technical work	5091.928692195299
12458. these are only halfway measures and	the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man	in industry h to progress without limit in salary and prestige	4989.226535533442
12459. we have made limited application of the 'parallel	ladder' plan	376.743440007181
12460. the highest rated non-supervisory engineering	title is 'research engineer'	394.51487648087374
12461. the salary schedule permits remuneration	greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering	supervision	1412.3608792700215
12462. we also have an 'engineering	section head- research engineer' classification which has salary	possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer	3050.1249528166127
12463. above this	point there is no generally used parallel ladder	375.97222885226495
12464. we also	do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a	'professional'	and also to give public recognition to individual technical	competence	4483.948385088301
12465. these include encouragement of and assistance	to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers	1251.9014966252885
12466. we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity a magazine	widely distributed both within and without the company and an	information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes	of all engineers	5321.067181950125
12467. publicity is given to the award of patents to	our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership	in technical societies	2177.3065605811726
12468. a recent and more pertinent action	has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the	vice-president for engineering	2828.6933205870473
12469. this function is staffed by engineers	chosen for their technical competence and who have the title member	of the technical staff'	2032.2460110757015
12470. salaries compare favorably with those paid	to the first two or three levels of management	1649.53710812521
12471. additional symbols	of status are granted such as reserved parking distinctive badge passes	authorizing special privileges and a difference in the treatment	of financial progress through merit	2871.0188834447194
12472. we presently are involved	in inaugurating a new development center	561.5222644034923
12473. operations of this nature	offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status	647.5682460662987
12474. all scientific	staff members will have the title 'research-staff member'	560.8614455749629
12475. the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the	scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific	field	2482.556962356262
12476. contrary to usual organization-position evaluations	the position to which research-staff members report administratively will	not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member	therefore are not necessarily evaluated as highly	4804.871356841161
12477. these	recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number	of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence	2178.0991115614224
12478. it	is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result	entirely from company efforts	2132.69353239022
12479. fundamental to the difficulty of creating	the desired prestige is the fact that in the business community	prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that	one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in	the management functions	4534.70962790551
12480. sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills	of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there	is a new home development called oakwood heights	5002.933145644429
12481. as a matter	of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated	county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages	in the $14000 range	3103.8859879661295
12482. but oakwood heights is unique in one particular	h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line	that starts at a central storage point	4667.162966323177
12483. this is a pilot operation	sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state	pipeline corporation with principal offices in new york state	2603.4901938367775
12484. its president is otis m waters partner in the law firm of timen	+ waters 5404 chrysler bldg new york city	1819.7517882395364
12485. vice-president	is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter	377.79638685945395
12486. ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft	distributors inc newburgh ny	1641.4581570049704
12487. the idea	of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty	1417.5823259584913
12488. not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u s	and canada even overseas write to fueloil + oil heat to inquire	if it's feasible and where it is being done	4135.709548331525
12489. its editors only	knew of one example to point to a public housing development of 278	homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march 1950 issue	3094.557949060522
12490. this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern	among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered	3493.1484773218317
12491. rather	the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis	of number of rooms and persons in the family	2028.4087500643957
12492. common complaints	included mrs murphy leaving her windows open all the time	a fresh air fan or the family was visiting aunt minnie with	the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil	5930.602791520877
12493. as a	result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central	distribution	939.8393297265304
12494. a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks	the situation at oakwood heights	1647.010950164627
12495. called a slo-flo meter	it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles	a key individual being don nelson	2305.306654287334
12496. tri-state has acquired	its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states	963.0635206533309
12497. there's an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed	by a lawyer	790.5716201537186
12498. the earlier new haven development was public housing	so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture	2837.059231681965
12499. these	have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and	a host of others	1099.7785119633052
12500. in working out the practical legal conclusions president	waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is	planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments	nationally	5158.654012231675
12501. it is always difficult or at least time-consuming	to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one	example	2313.3404328387633
12502. to overcome this the builder lays and completes the street	himself then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual	easement for the oil lines	4095.4145627627595
12503. when a family buys a home the title is subject	to a perpetual easement to tri-state	1256.2683776032543
12504. for the central storage	tri-state buys one acre buries its tanks and simply holds permanent	title to that piece	2571.422309873217
12505. in other words the whole storage and pipeline	system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather	to tri-state	2321.336309039237
12506. how does tri-state get its revenue from this	plan	393.29544867535225
12507. it leases the whole facility to a large oil company at least	large enough to have a strong credit position	1867.8702672648192
12508. this first test is	being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least	15 years	2360.4972640915103
12509. the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use	of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all	the homes is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable	to both parties	3940.6769452707376
12510. on this first venture the central storage is	20000 gallons in two tanks or an average of 400 gallons for each of	the 50 homes	3901.062488829725
12511. the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport	loads so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather	contingencies	1871.9432502092363
12512. however that is not all he has to do	392.8289862870611
12513. he must	undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine	heating	785.9038522323992
12514. in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water	form paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot	water hookups	3066.3058969629083
12515. again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals	as he finds best	1101.9881840874357
12516. for this first development the supplier	signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being	transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor	4670.916366979402
12517. the major	gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor	apparently can do well because delivery cost is low	2477.763409028722
12518. considerations	the officers of the new corporation have naturally	explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected	2815.5798371409905
12519. for example the officials of poughkeepsie town where the	project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow	clearing problem	2319.8358344503495
12520. the central storage is near a main artery quite	easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing with fewer	trucks in the residential streets	4296.0034059670625
12521. the public service commission	has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to	their	many regulations	1579.8432455390584
12522. several financial institutions both banks	and insurance companies have been sounded out	959.5732755992642
12523. they like it and would	supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong	oil companies	1882.5790340039953
12524. the government housing agencies consider it	feasible with one special stipulation	756.0956542062378
12525. there must be a restriction in	the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the	current market price for the oil h an obvious precaution since the	account is permanently wedded just like with gas or electricity	4397.270955881888
12526. for a few details of the system h the lines are 1-14''	x-tru-coat a product of republic steel corp and all lines	are welded	3685.4441393056886
12527. they are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some	areas four feet down particularly under roads to stay clear of all	other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy	trucking	3954.0538927194966
12528. the meter is mounted high on the basement wall	395.57010914164164
12529. its figures	are a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallons	1271.2625042310463
12530. it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour	1191.4761247025149
12531. ritter the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the	heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than	would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters	3857.2582708794043
12532. he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder	developments where gas is available	2366.9473165562476
12533. it would be pretty	difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods and that's	an understatement	1413.355454793723
12534. the job of getting property easements and street	easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging	2591.7179964424413
12535. but in a new development where everything starts from scratch	the solutions are simple	945.8630105432916
12536. what does tri-state actually	want to do now that it has the meters under franchise and certain	phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage	4473.539174175198
12537. it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including	its facility in their new home projects by financing and installing	the storage piping and meters and leasing these for 15 years	with renewal options to a strong oil company	4479.31674101186
12538. it may also work in one	other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters	letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities	4494.309349530338
12539. this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers	for the idea has so often been mentioned somewhat wistfully	2177.5744468604034
12540. but it's too early yet to go visit oakwood heights	558.4536418819516
12541. only eight of	the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on	june 8th; others were building	2031.9528972771773
12542. the big tanks were at the site but	still sunning themselves	749.40756790744
12543. a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches	and the town building inspector was paying a friendly if curious	visit	1885.3347582950876
12544. the oilheating industry is looking up led by a revival	of research and development	1410.1101946008591
12545. a primary ingredient in these fields	is imagination and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a	very good mark	1414.7748675809412
12546. every year about this time national gargle your cooling	system week rolls around	1177.3437821066398
12547. it pays in the long run to take good	care of the water works	940.0704857593103
12548. do it this way for the summer gargle:	first drain that old coolant down the storm sewer	2123.4945812038686
12549. don't	save the anti-freeze even if it the expensive permanent type	503.43528081131217
12550. the word means it won't boil away easily nothing else	557.5536044170135
12551. the rust	inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year and you don't want	to risk the rust that two years' use could mean	2736.2745367296084
12552. if a lot of rust shows in the drain use a good flushing cleaner	1412.942716297391
12553. then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor	262.04419619414585
12554. of	course you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators	1404.8499291089418
12555. now check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections	around the freeze-out plugs gaskets water pump seals and heater	fittings	2034.490360646831
12556. next run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat	opens and then look for leaks again	2594.8678164385183
12557. be sure the bugs and	dirt are blown out of the radiator fins	791.6452826284825
12558. use the air hose for this job	139.52411824064959
12559. check the temperature gage and be sure it is working	373.9091755835633
12560. if you	use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as dowguard	be sure to check it	2582.638216733995
12561. dow says that the fluid can be used now	for two years	642.6430184716447
12562. check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in	during the summer	747.2046678575095
12563. take precautions now to be sure you avoid	those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms	this summer	1878.2798054757216
12564. pull the thermostats	out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours	1397.742348922847
12565. spring and summer may be here officially but those thermos stay	in	636.715193212542
12566. the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from	any water cooled vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption	reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation	of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators	6305.47586231704
12567. if you	run into excess plug fouling on one truck check to be sure that the rig	has a thermostat	1891.642208567707
12568. the thermostat is important to get your engine up	to operating temperature quickly and to keep it running at its most	efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant	4795.204569957537
12569. for your truck insurance	2.9458022401180424
12570. there's	a good chance you are doubling on some coverage not taking discounts	coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut	3908.7328232755217
12571. have a talk with your insurance agent	93.16676807252574
12572. be careful that you keep	adequate coverage but look for places to save money	1415.6253343175163
12573. first go over the	type of coverage you now have	377.386732088862
12574. look for these features which may mean	you can save:    duplicate coverage	963.9810686198956
12575. avoid doubling up	on the same item	93.66856821955926
12576. for example don't pay in a truck policy for medical	coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy	3476.4252253407526
12577. does your policy have a lay-up clause	94.24367856160205
12578. this means that	if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days insurance	can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to	you	4655.782868436194
12579. this applies to repair work or winter storage	169.13930702854117
12580. the figure	five is important in insurance	139.9021272892131
12581. with many company policies you get	a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs	1268.066984055774
12582. this means either cars	or trucks	65.40572572184112
12583. discounts run up to 2% of cost	93.29479419581376
12584. usually premium	reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability	plan	1188.732244661454
12585. for example: if your bodily injury claims start payment after	the first $250 a 25% premium saving is often made	1897.5008913422862
12586. n the period since the end of world war 2- a period	coinciding	with merchandising demands for the colorful the unusual and the original	in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that	today	they are the acknowledged leaders in the field	6806.793694842255
12587. the importance of the	sign industry to the plastics industry however is not in terms of	volume alone	1565.253690174523
12588. designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing	approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings	of other industries	3486.6538467721207
12589. many of today's developments in thermoforming	stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of	preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers;	and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons	medallions etc owes much to the field as does the technology	of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent	plastics	5427.068120533073
12590. there is much that many industries can continue to	learn from some of the more recent developments described below	2604.902256610571
12591. the	concept of trans-illumination as just	one example offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-	no matter what industry is involved	2188.994025404142
12592. according	to a recent wall street journal survey plastics units now	account for more than 50% of all sign sales	2808.7488800818996
12593. five years ago they had	only 10% of the market with the remainder firmly entrenched in the	stronghold of neon tubing	2031.3039817875772
12594. and it's far from the end for plastics	250.4399113218104
12595. industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during	the 1960's will be of plastic construction	1723.1233208396504
12596. evidence of this	trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies	in the field as advance neon sign co los angeles calif	4262.718710222818
12597. four years ago the company's entire line was devoted to neon	signs; today 85% is in plastics	1403.7239691452237
12598. from the volume standpoint	the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive	1406.1685759922666
12599. aggregate	sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million	166.11079509236262
12600. currently	there are some 6000 companies in the field ranging from small firms	with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities	for production of metal electrical and plastic components	5182.526293575655
12601. the trend to plastics	2.9395858127477417
12602. what accounts for the rapid growth	of plastics in the sign and display field	1408.6893785488878
12603. out of many factors which	might be cited five are most important:  plastics combine	such properties as built-in color light weight optional transparency	or translucency resistance to corrosion as well as the ease of fabrication	3769.6216279837986
12604. according to one	major producer materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately	25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit	3256.4785338018287
12605. shipping cost is	also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft plastic sign weighs about 120 lb	compared to 275-300 lb for neon	1874.046074597672
12606. the weight advantage plus greater	durability of the plastic unit yields a saving of about one-fifth	in shipping	2353.54598044396
12607. the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings	are needed	639.9269578580596
12608. finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are	much lower than on fragile neon signs	1396.0240115959773
12609. they offer exceptional	design freedom making it	possible to incorporate contours and details	which give free range to the talents of the designer	2314.5450389869757
12610. vacuum- and pressure-formed	sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded	plastics	1182.3947332254384
12611. pre-decoration	low-cost molds and the freedom to form large	and small thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the	industry	2030.438511577433
12612. plastics signs work around the clock	65.39929273486523
12613. internal	illumination protected from the elements gives them powerful visual	appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command	attention and interest	2332.2596778493794
12614. advances in equipment and fabrication	techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide	choice of production techniques ranging from injection molding for	intricate smaller-size mass-production signs	to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited	runs	6222.512395853785
12615. among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field	what plastics	to use	938.8562104857871
12616. with its outstanding	optical characteristics weather resistance and formability strongly	dominates the picture	1189.4239441262284
12617. at present both the familiar cast acrylic	and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers	with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total	2990.145733234721
12618. of interest is a recent	announcement by du pont's	polychemicals dept of a new methyl methacrylate	monomer designated as monocite h 100 which was developed	specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and	lighting industry	6069.048217234783
12619. sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs	only one-third as much as glass is impervious to all kinds of weather	and will not yellow	2460.5607294459232
12620. its high impact strength even at low temperatures	resists chipping cracking and crazing according to du pont	2128.4611122987176
12621. cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed	signs background panels and molded or formed letters because of its	exceptional toughness ease of forming and excellent weathering properties	2989.3493692807665
12622. its clarity and good optical properties are other important	factors	562.5517856309478
12623. new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which	the two sheets of the laminate are of different color	2182.8702977308385
12624. thermoforming	the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical	way to produce a two-color sign	3046.0310918851856
12625. for specialized types of displays such as large three-dimensional	units reproducing a product package human or animal figures	etc reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols	are other materials frequently used	3332.356869247566
12626. a relative newcomer	in	outdoor signs is mylar polyester film now used as a printed overlay	for trans-illuminated signs	2601.398611722313
12627. for outdoor signs and	displays where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a	factor the choice of plastics is almost unlimited	2326.3413810161755
12628. here may be found	regular and impact styrene cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate and	cellulose propionate acrylic vinyl expandable styrene foam and polyethylene	3293.0022028893204
12629. the final choice of material depends upon such factors as	costs method of fabrication degree of complexity number of units	required time available for tooling and projected life expectancy of	the unit	3439.505182773949
12630. often the finished sign or display incorporates several types	of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques	2134.740451084475
12631. billboards	one of the most significant advancements in design	of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now	being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance	neon sign co los angeles and industrial electric inc	new orleans la	4203.091633363312
12632. the essential difference between the new	trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former	constructed of translucent plastic panels are lighted from within	3686.280300259339
12633. with the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of lumen output	as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light	2604.280847867814
12634. also the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure	and cannot obstruct the view of the sign	2602.770202475712
12635. the copy itself	including any text or illustrations is reproduced in full color directly	on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process	2601.904896531009
12636. the	film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto	the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for	replacement by new copy as required	5499.6347063362955
12637. spare sets of face panels simplify	the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged	for the old right in the field on a single trip	3247.3736360899566
12638. panels with	outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied	2114.0610075659315
12639. signs of this type have already made their appearance	in several larger cities and others are on the way	1731.154459309871
12640. it is believed that	these boards will within the next few years replace many of the	conventional flood-lighted boards now in use	3265.080105053047
12641. trans-illuminated	signs also show versatility in other directions	167.45333055539325
12642. as used by industrial	electric inc the film panels are printed one at a time as	are 24-sheet posters	2618.224946781635
12643. thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent	plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels	for use on cutouts or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin	faces	3549.385738094997
12644. in this way the sign maker has an economical means for displaying	uniform copy on different sign media	2347.44601666981
12645. recently industrial	electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern	plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign	1413.8525054254674
12646. comprised of 16	triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections it makes it possible to	combine three different signs in a single unit	2808.511521008758
12647. the triangles automatically	revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec of viewing time for	each poster subject	1571.4856003133882
12648. sixteen panels each slightly more than 1-12 ft	wide make up the 25-ft length of the sign	2116.6709746007155
12649. fill many needs	perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility	of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays	would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this	complex field- changeable signs	4444.664211258185
12650. signs are meant to convey	a message and in most cases this requires words and letters	1881.4859694072977
12651. frequently	the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products	price changes etc	1097.7359744680034
12652. the huge market for changeable signs has spurred	a universal demand for individual plastic letters in all shapes	and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them	4979.702165043496
12653. here	are some of the newer items currently available:   poster products	inc chicago ill: a changeable copy and display	sign	which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of	colors onto which are mounted snap-in letters figures or words screened	on acetate or other types of sheet stock	4950.150073008446
12654. the background which	is available	in various widths and continuous lengths is extruded with	parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely	3464.526334326513
12655. the adaptaplex co beaverton ore; letters molded	of butyrate available in several sizes in either red or black	1574.581109402966
12656. ideal	for merchandising use they are weather-resistant and have mounting	pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern	background panel	3700.7144151991815
12657. for large letters eg thermoformed	of acrylic or butyrate there are other techniques	790.225406185298
12658. for example	in a typical store installation fifty 24-in and six 36-in red	acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background	3490.354430516783
12659. the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb each made	it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic	angle brackets cemented to the letters	3348.663835210842
12660. stainless steel screws were	used to minimize corrosion stains	392.2683230530839
12661. for mounting to corrugated plastic	backgrounds very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters	and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings its ends	twisted behind the panels	3443.79350439145
12662. large injection-molded letters are	also available for sign installations	388.8325663532559
12663. wagner sign service inc	chicago for example supplies them in several colors in heights of	4 6 8 10 and 17 inches	2171.7083321393875
12664. they are molded of a special weather-resistant	formulation of tenite butyrate	750.3244041999271
12665. also available from this company	are snug-grip plasti-bars extruded of transparent acrylic material	which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material	2312.025143287323
12666. made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft the bars are shaped in cross	section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back	of the letters	4843.869322916946
12667. still another approach to the changeable letter	type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products azusa	calif	1885.0485297235762
12668. this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in	panels formed of 0	959.7265997600465
12669. 080-in clear butyrate sheet stock masked	and sprayed on the rear side	641.6744006085798
12670. finished signs are produced by sliding	the separate letter panels into channels of 0	1418.144973840523
12671. 025-in aluminum	which may be mounted to various surfaces	260.4986086233463
12672. the sheets are extruded of	tenite butyrate by jet specialties co los angeles calif	1392.9416579667209
12673. on large-area units where additional structural requirements	are imposed one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed	channels of the acrylic or butyrate	2332.809593374123
12674. joined side by side such channels make possible construction	of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft high and	of unlimited width	3474.7540204381053
12675. letters may be wired to the face of the combined	channels painted on the first surface or handled in other ways	2037.7154619149733
12676. from	the inside out	don't insert your components into fixed openings	they may or may not fit; position your components before you close	them in	3883.45572177371
12677. for example:   don't wall in your kitchen before	you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances	1420.1870922636283
12678. it's a lot quicker	and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect	the end wall after they are all in place	3901.3497438705353
12679. set your bathtub before	you close in the end of the bathroom	643.3387634354792
12680. don't try to wrestle a	400-lb tub f through a narrow doorway	968.1580694723413
12681. finish your plumbing	before you frame it in		78.70369118954451
12682. finish installing and	connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them	in	1878.033461189414
12683. there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a	furnace in a finished f closet	1722.0938647304768
12684. don't position your studs	before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way	you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the	window	4847.878089948628
12685. you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows	in one two three order- first the stud on one side then the window	then the stud on the other side	3565.497736575293
12686. install your disappearing	stair to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before	you drywall the ceiling	2129.3397807238134
12687. don't close in your house until everything	has been carried in	497.9733980750555
12688. last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall	between the house and garage	1185.9231038396533
12689. that way he can truck his parts right	indoors and unload them under the roof	1099.382197480975
12690. no auto maker would	dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons	in the block	2830.839636287306
12691. and trailer makers those most industrialized and therefore	most efficient of homebuilders say they save hundreds of dollars	by always building from the inside out	2589.039033777906
12692. everything	to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling	offers you	this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less	news of all because h  it makes it easy to handle much heavier	units so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated	components like those shown in the pictures alongside	7820.476362491332
12693. it makes materials handling the only construction cost that	should be lower today than in 1929	1260.0137376763598
12694. it changes the answers to who should do what and where	753.0460432340016
12695. it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases	the chance for shop fabrication where almost everything can be made	better and cheaper	2460.476891180176
12696. it changes the answers on when to do what	at the site	960.9202736326745
12697. for example instead of putting in your driveways last	you can now save money by putting them in first	1715.6670860849222
12698. instead of closing the house in first you can	now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to	p		2344.2879855571523
12699. it changes the answers on builder-dealer relations	94.43059438338294
12700. not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs	by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer	2829.805510936182
12701. but now many of	these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming	up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient	specialized equipment	to deliver everything just where it is needed-	drywall inside the house siding along the sides trusses on the walls	roofing on the roof etc	5365.984237687752
12702. says clarence thompson: we	dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder	cheaper than he could do it himself	3478.6606983277825
12703. so	from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling	add up to one-fourth of the total construction	cost of housing	3483.952467651315
12704. that house + home round table	was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials	handling says clarence thompson long chairman of the lumber dealers'	research council	2026.5561877150526
12705. it made our whole industry recognize	the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer carrier equipment	maker dealer and builder all working together to cut the cost	of materials handling	5153.192642408754
12706. before that we lumber dealers were working	here is where things stand	today: almost all of the 3000 lumber dealers who cater	primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new	houses are mechanized	3926.0260887889017
12707. there are few areas left where a builder cannot	find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything	at lower cost just where his workmen will need it	4832.572659447071
12708. practically	all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized	or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber asphalt	shingles glass block face brick plaster lime hardboard gypsum	wallboard and sheathing cement insulation sheathing floor tile acoustical	tile plaster base and asbestos shingles	4602.241946651106
12709. truck and	materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to	meet almost every homebuilding need	1652.6873208735203
12710. for some significant new items	see the pictures	167.05015094943371
12711. more than 50% of all lumber is unitized;	an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will	strap their shipments for mechanized handling	3893.427256799458
12712. of these 376 said they	make no extra charge for strapping in standard units because they	save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost	2704.516713269479
12713. most of the others	will swallow their 50 to $3 charge rather than lose	a good customer	2120.7597032441527
12714. with a 15500-lb fork-lift dealers can unload	unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30mbf compared	with $1	1571.3041695467073
12715. 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time says	james wright of nlrda	2111.334836084642
12716. lumber dealers and lumber	manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments-	48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high		1343.5915983505115
12717. these units make it easy to	load as much as 48000 bd ft	car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars	3272.290368745019
12718. the	railroads have responded by adding 20000 more box cars with doors 12'	or wider for forklift unloading	and by cutting their freight rates	twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars	3461.490327006514
12719. first was a 1958 cut	of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40000	lb; later came a 1961 cut on the west coast	of 7cwt on 70000 lb-plus carloads	more than $4mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70000		5851.0722303273815
12720. more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars	and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type	6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5	3447.9776839365672
12721. for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof	paper	752.9360608055741
12722. this costs from 75 to $2	43.35329194212874
12723. 30mbf but the cover can	these carriers	says nrlda's	james wright: since 1958 carriers that move material	from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes	than any of the dealer's other equipment	5775.846808280645
12724. the reason: today's	components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled	by a truckdriver and a helper	1875.1284912540111
12725. so manufacturers have pioneered a new	type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier	963.6462298410668
12726. it cuts the lumber dealer's	cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload	it and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction	of the cost of hand unloading	3937.0839825865087
12727. and it helps the builder because it	can handle a more efficiently packaged load can deliver it to the best	spot and never	takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it	5475.502864829644
12728. says wright: our survey shows that one third of the	retail	dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling	in the coming two years	2741.851754029082
12729. and most of the gain will be in self-unloading	vehicles	558.9593924458193
12730. even america's most efficient builder bob schmitt	of berea hopes to cut his labor costs another $2000 per house as a	result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation	by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works	6323.304431409164
12731. already	this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from	170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion	2176.1078810624936
12732. builder	eddie carr of washington past president of nahb cut his bricklaying	costs $150 a house by adopting the scr masonry process	worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the structural	clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better	work for less	6681.091888600364
12733. a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand	bricks from $81 to $43	938.0298962002764
12734. 50 by adopting this same process cut them another	$7	555.923675139221
12735. 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient easy-to-spot 100-brick	packages	640.8642082129398
12736. the scr process with its precision corner-posts	its precision guide lines its working level scaffold and its hand-level	brick supply takes eight manhours to get set but once ready	it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day	6562.478335359932
12737. one good way to cut your labor waste is to make	sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew	2452.926846065412
12738. reports	jim lendrum: by studying men on the job we found that two men-	a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three	4092.8065214417875
12739. we	found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall	panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men	don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper	team	3764.861148547259
12740. we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job	five men not four is the magic number	2832.240530869542
12741. no house was ever	built that could not have been built better for less if the work had	been better planned and the work better scheduled	2734.1614636237414
12742. 5: don't waste any 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save 3	a stud	this is the most penny-wise pound-foolish chisel a builder	can commit	3909.5500879579376
12743. green lumber was all very well back in the days	of wet plaster when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then	shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum	3437.1867237156357
12744. but now that all production	builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels	green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford	3711.0526255201125
12745. green	studs cost about 65; dry studs cost less than 3 more	642.1113619533659
12746. so if	a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste	even 20 seconds the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry	stud	4689.314797702655
12747. there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to	be alone	1402.1201241660588
12748. not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the	crowds and common happenstance	1880.7594146179358
12749. if you've travelled in europe a	time or two it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone	feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic	3442.9644597439246
12750. following a guide and gratefully so is an excellent way to	see all the important places when everything is strange and new	3263.8019077836875
12751. however	after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas the	places and forums the churches and museums the palaces and castles	and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe you'll want to	change your course and follow the by-roads at will far from the market	places	4962.880942112942
12752. the champagne at troyes the traditional capital	of the champagne country has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has	at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d'argent	5349.505368421066
12753. you	can relive history and follow in fancy the crusaders in their quest	for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi an ancient	town in the heel of italy's boot	3443.407570732713
12754. and you don't meet the folks from	home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time	and tourists since the middle ages	3694.430791717086
12755. time stands still as you climb	the narrow stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain	slopes or wander through story-book towns perched atop lofty crags	their faces turned to the sea	3559.9011288550573
12756. they've been there since the days	of the moors and the saracens	963.2518477796954
12757. and what better way to end a day	than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's	village on the mediterranean	2604.1406192848835
12758. an almost too-simple-to-be-true	way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself	behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road	4315.746290585074
12759. for those	who need or want and can afford another car buying one and driving	it on the grand tour then shipping it home is one popular plan for	a do-it-yourself pilgrimage	3457.143175625708
12760. then of course there are those of us	who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car	2809.0952685364164
12761. the answer	to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one	1260.0107932876633
12762. almost any travel agent will reserve	a car for you	565.0721056758351
12763. you can call one of the car rental services directly	and ask	them to reserve a car of your choice and some transportation lines	offer this service as well	3112.1603064470323
12764. with few exceptions your car will be waiting	for you at dockside airport railroad station or hotel when you	arrive oftentimes at no additional cost	3909.3217518371553
12765. you can wait of course until	you arrive in europe before renting your car	941.5397909759846
12766. the disadvantages	to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models	readily available or you may have to wait a few days or during the busy	tourist season when cars are in great demand you might find it fairly	difficult to get a car at all	7603.825409086663
12767. since charges are relatively the	same reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of	having one on tap when you want it	2729.5032553013993
12768. for those who plan to travel	to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer	a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave	it in another city or even another country when you are ready to	return home	7334.166619391132
12769. at some cities this pick-up and delivery service is without	additional charge and if you are budget-wise when you are planning	your itinerary you will take advantage of these free delivery	and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries	4393.429236897274
12770. international touring documents are usually provided	with the car as are road maps and touring data	1896.2512304766428
12771. a valid american	driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal spain	yugoslavia and eastern	europe	1415.204419238637
12772. if you plan to visit any of these countries	you can obtain your international driving permit before you	leave at a nominal fee- around $3	3895.7698524761195
12773. your insurance too with	most agencies is provided with the car covering comprehensive fire	theft liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies	in different countries	2867.0225153870683
12774. if you would feel happier with full collision	insurance there is a small additional charge again varying from country	to country and depending on the term of such insurance	4648.9957362675905
12775. the average	charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1	504.13044511224643
12776. the charge is variable however and goes as low as 50 a day in	ireland and as high as $2	2850.4843123087007
12777. 00 a day in greece	14.815033485982005
12778. rental fees	are variable too throughout the countries of europe	562.9632970091029
12779. there are as	many rates as there are countries and models of cars available	941.9826085979597
12780. as in	the united states there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus	a few cents per kilometer driven and the per-day rate drops if the car	is retained for a week	5184.72404601493
12781. it drops again after fifteen andor twenty-one	days	167.08333340734032
12782. it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from	80 to 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and	while you might prefer a familiar ford chevrolet or even a cadillac	which are available in some countries it is probably wiser to choose	the smaller european makes which average thirty thirty-five and	even forty miles to the gallon	8490.329846717605
12783. your choice of model will undoubtedly	be governed by the number of people travelling in your group	1404.3564470522247
12784. with the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny sedans will	seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage	space for really economical transportation	4836.023858131089
12785. there is a large variety	of models to choose from in most countries however including 6-passenger	sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that	much greater than for the wee sedans	3645.081451575343
12786. the basic costs are generally	pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you	reserve your car but some of them offer supplementary advantages	4092.690519793107
12787. there is the free intra-city rent it here leave it there service	as an example the free delivery and collection at the airport dockside	or your hotel luggage racks touring documents and information	and other similar services	3943.0683834101887
12788. a little investigation by telephone or reading	the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these	pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits	4118.742349106985
12789. the investigation	will be well worth your time	165.89533198382273
12790. all model cars are not	available in all countries	389.11253574539467
12791. quite naturally there is a greater availability	of those models which are manufactured within a specific country	1418.4227038877057
12792. if you would like to start your tour in italy where the rental	fees are actually the lowest in europe fiats in all sizes are available	as are alfa romeo giulietta models	5172.120801205973
12793. if you wish to budget	closely on transportation saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries	one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1	2727.874301649758
12794. 26 a day plus 3	a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station	wagon seating six at just	$1	2371.56875429501
12795. 10 a day and 10-12 a kilometer	94.5088581107418
12796. if you will be using your car	more than fifteen days which isn't all unlikely the daily rates	drop quite sharply to 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal	30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon	6603.823610186984
12797. with six in the	group the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily	fee	1893.0288481368596
12798. in the majority of countries however the rates range from	$3	751.9375769917622
12799. 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7	642.0334392177738
12800. 00 a day for the larger luxury european models with the rate	per kilometer driven starting at 3 and going up as high as 12	3906.7124128041223
12801. the same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet	not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate	or rate per kilometer driven	3333.9579763343163
12802. the variations are not too great	65.26766838928086
12803. rates	for american cars are somewhat higher ranging from about $8	502.1511526989564
12804. 00 a day	up to $14	64.971445279592
12805. 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible but the rate per	kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models	2328.6355542317474
12806. rates in greece and finland are fairly high actually the highest	in europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in ireland	3479.26591174138
12807. if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a	month it might be wise for you to lease a car	2176.5909288676153
12808. the actual over-all	cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the	rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new	car	5161.341240605118
12809. you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner	which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized	dealers throughout europe	2859.0454602134623
12810. further there is no mileage charge	or mileage limitations when you lease a car and you pay only the flat	monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since	the car is registered and insured individually for your trip	6500.999448485391
12811. there is	a fairly wide selection of models of english german and french manufacture	from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 citroe^n	2 cv volkswagens renaults to the 6-passenger simca	beaulieu	3777.2806180903876
12812. leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a	car in europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical	and satisfactory	4474.479902951311
12813. after the first month rates are considerably	less averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger	models	1891.672710028522
12814. there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent	cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan	2122.8698893416376
12815. for one thing the driver	usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes	pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road	3337.3612318545283
12816. then	too european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on	the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed	up with them	4090.555082073161
12817. still there is a way for those who want to see some	of the back country of europe by car	1872.0672761696646
12818. the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven	car	251.3972871137716
12819. it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be	500.2861331945367
12820. your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7	140.06046828505353
12821. 00	a day but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger	cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800	2327.1272314257267
12822. the big	spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven being governed by	the rate at which gasoline is consumed	3045.3660419454177
12823. since most european cars average	more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars it naturally	follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less	but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize	this provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger	limousine	5067.710278521097
12824. the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars	vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for	the drive-yourself cars	3693.2967159088453
12825. however whether you arrange to have a european	or american model if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity	in relation to the number of people in your party your transportation	expense will average very close to $10	4211.069312126606
12826. 00 per day per passenger	22.157953740910337
12827. this will include your helpful english-speaking chauffeur and a	drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day	1876.383456503021
12828. if you drive greater	distances than that you'll just be skimming the surface and will	never discover the enchantment fascination and beauty which lured	you in the first place to explore the hinterlands	5342.647359132787
12829. of course if you	want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac	limousine just for you and your bride you'll have a memorable	tour but it won't be cheap and it is not recommended unless you own	a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the irish sweepstakes	5341.105666954826
12830. in american romance almost nothing rates higher than what the	movie men have called meeting cute- that is boy-meets-girl	seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct	and acute boredom	5615.881261273184
12831. just about the most enthralling real-life example	of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga:	reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts but he said	simultaneously i wish they were emeralds	3837.417495240554
12832. aside from the comico-romantico	content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily	pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the	conversation to go on	4848.276449081248
12833. the way macarthur said his line- if	you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would	probably have gone like this: f primary stresses on emeralds and	wish; note pitch 3 on emeralds but with a slight degree	of drawl one degree of oversoftness h	4708.938786635375
12834. conclusions: the people	involved knew clearly the relative	values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental	2121.9439076992076
12835. and the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt	was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture	1872.7931631561132
12836. in	other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they	shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of english	words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can	change their meaning from black to white	6444.18347921359
12837. at this point unfortunately	romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider	if you can bear it what might have happened if macarthur for	some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an eskimo	girl in eskimo	4392.501829540086
12838. to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just	so much blubber	966.9261243057748
12839. the point- quite simply- is this: words they	might have had; but communication no	944.9386041216421
12840. this basic principle	the first in a richly knotted bundle was conveyed to me by dr henry	lee smith jr at the university of buffalo where he heads	the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics	5778.5853684645035
12841. a	brisk amusing man apparently constructed on an ingenious system of	spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind smith	began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls- a project	considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young	rat named arthur who never could make up his mind	5221.361338570359
12842. later he	became one of the central spirits of the army language program and	the language school of washington's foreign service institute	3262.3102529298462
12843. it was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture	shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he	first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication	4018.7505866354995
12844. to the trained ear of the linguist talk has always	revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker-	such things as geographical origin andor history socio-economic identity	education	4674.183545543552
12845. it is only fairly recently however that linguists	have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way	that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure	of human communication between two people	4225.514665182053
12846. this for obvious reasons	makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric	interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used	to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy	5909.7451167672825
12847. smith's	first workout with stresses pitches and junctures was based on mother	which spells in our culture a good deal more than bread alone	3686.374602844656
12848. for example if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person there are	certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother	2188.1734093212435
12849. the usual us norm would be: f middle pitches slight	pause before mother slight rise at the end	2364.858537449477
12850. the symbols	of mother's status here are all usual for culture usa	643.0298060569066
12851. quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: f note the	drop to pitch 1 on mother with no rise at the end of the	sentence; this is a fade ending and what you have here is a	downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional	respect for mother	7439.846822158402
12852. even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie	goes with: f in other words the way the speaker relates to mother	is clearly indicated	2596.588868796819
12853. and while the meaning of the words is not in	this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second	and third examples is definitely impaired	4300.827658729624
12854. an accompanying record	of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a	throaty	rasp	1255.785783148152
12855. with this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly	thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling	things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that	he had departed from the customs of his culture	6478.821651212045
12856. the joint investigations	of linguistics and psychiatry have established in point	of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words	are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling	over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate	to the rest of the world	5404.003369913642
12857. since interviewing is the basic therapeutic	and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of	interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions	in new research and training	5167.520306550925
12858. some of the earliest recordings	made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately	to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records	of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if	they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most	skilled and sensitive experts	5246.473993119054
12859. in a general way psychiatrists were	able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-	that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic that such	things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not	necessarily by words	7008.450511300475
12860. at a minimum recording- usually on tape	which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview	alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored	repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists	4299.298337806042
12861. newest	to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have	carried that minimum to a new level	2574.3637238396996
12862. by adding a systematic analysis	with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews they have supplied	a new set of techniques for the therapist	2451.12386785708
12863. linguistic charting of	the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs	from expected norms	1901.3967652854044
12864. it flags such possible breakdowns of communication	as rehearsed dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence	or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at	all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences	3852.3513190035665
12865. interpretation naturally remains the role of the therapist but	orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical	and socio-economic background but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways	of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably	beefed up by the linguist	6659.798999826971
12866. his esoteric chartings of the voice alert	the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying	psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the	therapist and eventually to the patient	3553.9248895609016
12867. in one now-historic first	interview	for example the transcript	goes like this: f the therapist's level	tone is bland and neutral- he has for example avoided stressing	you which would imply disapproval; or surprise which would	set the patient apart from other people	6748.381886412525
12868. the patient on the other	hand is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent	she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed	a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity	with literary or scientific language	and she is telling a story she	has mentally rehearsed some time before	5277.9677028124015
12869. then she catapults into everything	and everybody putting particular violence on everybody	indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that	is it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up	to this point	6309.751889298642
12870. consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention	258.89333102352
12871. he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably	not the true target of her resentment	2111.3296713477607
12872. immediately thereafter the	patient fractures her rehearsed story veering into an oversoft breathy	sloppily articulated i don't feel like talking right now	2180.8005945953864
12873. within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent	to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's	husband	3247.045810736386
12874. she says later but still within the opening five minutes	i keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death	2033.3775938404833
12875. the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are	all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain	signals that she does not accept divorce	4289.273303226905
12876. by saying another emotional	death she reveals that there has been a previous one although	she has not described it in words	2183.878120690479
12877. this the therapist may pursue	in	later questioning	247.92624730099834
12878. the phrase emotional death interesting and	to a non-scientific mind rather touching suggests that this woman	may have some flair for words perhaps even something of the temperament	regrettably called creative	3331.436363997937
12879. since the psychiatric interview	like any other interview depends on communication it is significant	to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked	skill and long experience	4989.636623878038
12880. his own communication apparatus operated	superbly and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total	lack of resemblance to the blunted monumentally unmeshed mechanism of	dr blauberman	2842.305980503086
12881. interestingly enough- although none of the real-life	therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman-	when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered	any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview	techniques; almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions	on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again	8261.022961012502
12882. yet in spite of this intensive study of the taped interviews	by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact	that in the first five minutes of an initial interview the patient	often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;	to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively	or scientifically how to listen	5613.940534219217
12883. naturally the patient does not say	i hate my father or sibling rivalry is what bugs me	2121.999305021593
12884. what he does do	is give himself away by communicating information over	and above the words involved	1418.7290890253566
12885. some of the classic indicators as described	by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first	five minutes are these:  stammering	or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal	ambiguity	or uncertainty	5642.778133676403
12886. on the other hand significant facts may be concealed-	she may mean i; or everybody as it did with the tense	and irritable woman mentioned before may refer to a specific person	3438.486072061489
12887. the word that is not used can be as important as the word that	is used; therapist andor linguist must always consider the alternatives	3705.4882640478463
12888. when someone says for example they took x rays to	see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how	this statement would normally be made	3090.0741700507647
12889. was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the	fact	h amateur linguists note here that pursewarden in durrell's	alexandria quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which	is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship	6544.739342953176
12890. she was just another freighter from the states and she seemed	as commonplace as her name	1265.0407525734704
12891. she was the john harvey one	of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans	bombs and bullets to the us fifteenth air force to field	marshal montgomery's eighth army then racing up the calf of the	boot of italy in that early december of 1943	7321.362234193631
12892. the john harvey	arrived in bari a port on the adriatic on november 28th	making for porto nuovo which as the name indicates was the ancient	city's new and modern harbor	3346.5194090232208
12893. hardly anyone ashore marked her as	she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole	1653.1766171783554
12894. if anyone thought	of the john harvey it was to observe that she was straddled by	a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit	the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and	whatever else it was that she carried	4919.246970013209
12895. it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt	before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of	mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront	4644.283998843094
12896. for in a world	as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud poison gas	was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons	2611.7821065967773
12897. throughout	the early years of world war 2 reports persisted that the	axis powers had used gas- germany in russia japan in china again	3696.4381914841615
12898. influential people in america were warning	the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by	the germans in future campaigns	2027.3074238865902
12899. some extremists went so far as to	urge our using it first	962.8121074652888
12900. to silence extremists to warn the axis president	roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august:	from time to time since the present war began there have	been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating	use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices	of warfare	5187.690788039488
12901. i have been loath to believe that any nation even our	present enemies could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such	terrible and inhumane weapons	4285.892024896745
12902. however evidence that the	axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an	intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety	of sources	2749.213777560369
12903. use of such weapons has been outlawed by the	general opinion of civilized mankind	1418.2771740610285
12904. this country has not used them	and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them	1563.4138565643657
12905. i state categorically	that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such	weapons unless they are first used by our enemies	3674.4382167282943
12906. the	following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave	effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in	southern italy	2848.1188122871117
12907. bari was chosen as a depot not only for its seeming	safety but because of its proximity to airfields	2580.4903204128727
12908. any retaliatory	gas attack would be airborne	93.50352979120103
12909. it would be made in three waves- the	first to lay down a smokescreen the second to drop the gas bombs the	third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below	5018.654841981862
12910. so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey	642.8809156743943
12911. a	detachment	of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under	first lt howard d beckstrom went aboard followed by lt	thomas h richardson the cargo security officer	4668.935850141408
12912. only a few other people- very important people- knew	of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks	1260.9715495819078
12913. no one else must	know	22.24233418910974
12914. thus in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that	knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy	at bari	2974.9557803937887
12915. it was the night of december 2 1943 and it was growing	dark in bari	1645.7107859791438
12916. it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german	me-210	plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit	2038.4209310113583
12917. capt	a b jenks of the office of harbor defense was very	worried	1182.1700087371044
12918. he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning	to the attack in italy	944.8963060077834
12919. on november 24th they had made a raid on la	maddalena	754.9128957188362
12920. two days later some 30 of them had struck at a convoy	off bougie sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that	the me-210 had made its first appearance	3470.455351924584
12921. after it had reappeared	the next two nights jenks went to higher headquarters and said:	for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been	over the city taking pictures	4809.895635200007
12922. they're just waiting for the proper	time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic	1573.848980678022
12923. but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist	970.2862888187279
12924. even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now	being directed by the young and energetic general peltz the commander	who would conduct the little blitz on london in 1944 a	major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered	seriously	5011.275219133284
12925. true there had been raids on naples- but naples was	pretty far north on the opposite coast	2097.167668751018
12926. no bari was out of range	42.85194143459347
12927. more than that allied air had complete superiority in the eighth	army's sector	1185.314154835401
12928. so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch	the scouting plane put in five more appearances and to feel the	certainty of this dread rising within him	3104.374144955792
12929. for jenks knew that bari's	defenses were made of paper	557.8198568798658
12930. the royal air force had but a single	light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available	1269.491183542315
12931. there	were no raf fighter squadrons on bari airfield	391.71861877630613
12932. the	radar station with the best location was still not serviceable	501.70000907561416
12933. and everywhere in evidence among the few	remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple	command	2351.6254961681507
12934. it had been made shockingly evident that very morning	to ensign kay k vesole in charge of the armed guard aboard the	john bascom	2454.108929922714
12935. a british officer had come aboard and told him	that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs	were actually dropped	4254.54986389707
12936. then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a	radar-controlled	shore gun firing white tracers	1099.4265459328242
12937. this harbor is	a bomber's paradise the britisher had said with frank grimness	1189.4110972846165
12938. it's up to you to protect yourselves	94.03495093206683
12939. we can't expect any	help from the fighters at foggia either	751.6227910496574
12940. they're all being used on	offensive missions	94.08590942462378
12941. not fire until	the bombs came down! he thought of the tons and tons of flammable	fluid beneath his feet and shook his head	3706.2670638496165
12942. like hell! like hell	he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out	953.0654117275819
12943. what would his guns guide on then- the north star	560.2464920406877
12944. ensign	vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering	of the bombs and when night began to fall he put seaman 2c donald	l norton and seaman 1c william a rochford on the guns	and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette	5028.5299489513
12945. below decks seaman 1c stanley bishop had begun to write	a letter home	1183.5114941282714
12946. above decks on the john harvey lieutenant	richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and	felt uneasy	2023.3480386317744
12947. there were lights glinting in the city too even though	it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible	3267.425852486901
12948. bari was	asking for it he thought	93.16150419964441
12949. for five days now they had been	in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold	2349.9466030912627
12950. richardson wondered	when it would be unloaded	93.61122250045125
12951. he hoped they would put it somewhere way	way down in the earth	1181.1504261802868
12952. the burden of his secret was pressing down	on him as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men	2021.707737578016
12953. lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john	harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing	more dangerous than high explosive bombs	4288.684844522475
12954. they seemed happy at the	delay in unloading glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty	port such as bari	2326.459339332695
12955. nine of them had gone down the gangplank already	394.2603083988459
12956. deck cadet james l cahill and seaman walter brooks had	been the first to leave	1100.9074891998748
12957. richardson had returned their departing grins	with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in	trade	2352.4469847389173
12958. the other half of the crew plus beckstrom and his men	had remained aboard	939.7493618951294
12959. richardson glanced to sea and started slightly	140.75368507828566
12960. damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor-	porto vecchio	1099.8636622172812
12961. the night was so clear that richardson had no	difficulty making out the silhouette	1410.948182485226
12962. then the thought of a cloudless	sky made him shiver and he glanced upward	950.6275141930658
12963. it was a clear night and it was raining!   capt michael	a musmanno military governor of the sorrentine peninsula had	also seen and felt the rain	4111.495768726387
12964. but he had mistaken it for bugs	93.96419225043418
12965. captain musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant	name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed	olive oil for the sorrentine's civilian population	4113.275984108547
12966. at exactly 7:30 he felt a fluttering object brush	his face	500.4998980641486
12967. he snatched at it savagely	22.067459886298217
12968. he turned the beam of his flashlight	on it	259.68660968941043
12969. it was the silver foil from the chocolate	bar he had been eating	1192.5601062005553
12970. but how could-	0.20041515
12971. another	longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth	248.54649472258447
12972. it was two feet long	14.749643106993148
12973. it was	not candy wrapping	22.464925388780237
12974. it was window- the tinsel paper	dropped by bombers to jam radar sets to fill the scope with hundreds	of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers	2972.2569789608906
12975. fermate!	musmanno bellowed to his italian crewmen	139.0494326791346
12976. stop! stop	the engines!   unsinkable slowed and stopped hundreds	of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black the air	raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek the anti-aircraft guns coughed	and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came	whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor	at bari	5399.925164273738
12977. they had come from airports in the balkans these	hundred-odd junkers 88's	966.660460549303
12978. they had winged over the adriatic they	had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her	attacking with deadly skill	2318.243042980017
12979. they had ruined the radar warning system	with their window they had made themselves invisible above their flares	2356.151658102487
12980. and they also had the lights of the city the port wall lanterns	and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on	2039.3095452701498
12981. after the first two	were blacked out the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian	crew who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring	homing beacon until british mp's shot it out	5895.206946175384
12982. in that	interval the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor	645.8759756858819
12983. merchant	ships illuminated in the light of the flares made to seem like	stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss	3887.747206504293
12984. the little unsinkable sank almost immediately	43.63771667278227
12985. captain musmanno	roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for	a raft	2576.6298198800387
12986. they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few	minutes before their schooner went under	1571.2739988725784
12987. john bascom	went down early too	65.4704083249615
12988. ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly	but they had no targets	790.5978058651706
12989. most of the junkers were above the	blinding light of the flares and the radar-controlled shore gun had	been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs	4663.493211903284
12990. vesole rushed	from gun to gun attempting to direct fire	374.7014157135874
12991. he was wounded but fought	on	65.2685735044766
12992. norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors	502.7527248062159
12993. bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20mm gun pumping out 400 rounds	before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one three and	five	4098.780489932075
12994. now the bascom was mortally wounded	43.18469307231785
12995. luckily she was	not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt	1661.9605107407958
12996. the order to abandon ship was given but cries of pain could	be heard from the wounded below decks	1729.2539807010442
12997. there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at	you wondering why you are staring open-mouthed in amazement	3042.85957358789
12998. you explain	i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this	very same event before	1254.8206297896143
12999. i can't tell when but i'm positive i witnessed	this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in	the past!   this experience will have happened to many of	you	4974.9336597321
13000. emerson in his lecture refers to the h startling experience	which almost every person confesses in daylight that particular	passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same	order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have	been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard	precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when	5703.026838497246
13001. most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling	as the deja vue illusion just as they dismiss	dream previsions as coincidences	3280.9778207685863
13002. in this manner they side-step the seemingly	hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which	all of us grope continually	2162.6188150320068
13003. when a man recognizes a certain	experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance	of deja vue	except for the fact that he knows just why the experience	seems familiar	5653.481002108487
13004. occasionally there are examples of prevision	which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude	1252.0568168902516
13005. one day maeterlinck coming with a friend upon an event	which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed	the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion	was completely mystified	5661.139347538493
13006. rudyard kipling's scorn for the jargon	of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered	h how or why had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life	film	3225.482989132633
13007. the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something	about myself	1180.78457198909
13008. one day when he attended a war memorial	ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout	man on his left his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the	rough slab flooring and someone clasping him by the arm whispered	i want a word with you please	4961.783750539466
13009. at that moment kipling was	overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical	details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six	weeks earlier	4823.702200907197
13010. freud probably contributed more than anyone else	to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents	in our wakeful thoughts	2169.0131538392498
13011. dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance	prevision and retrovision	375.902029747194
13012. the basic mystery of dreams which embraces	all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical	dream is in the fact that they are original visual continuities	4838.678207734212
13013. i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i	lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town	2468.1990262473623
13014. i am	sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence	so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news pictures	i have seen	4297.434524785931
13015. and when psychology explains glibly but the subconscious	mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely	identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably	as part of the individual mind	4142.725396998119
13016. skeptics may deny the	more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally	observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance	of routine evidence	4832.58456986242
13017. the question becomes what is	a dream	94.31995578170572
13018. is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie	396.2812589237716
13019. every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type	even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful	thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available	3847.739331618108
13020. in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects	762.3137722769357
13021. but these are dreamed in original action in some particular continuity	which we don't remember having seen in real life	1890.07119966709
13022. for instance	the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with	photographic realism sees smith driving the car; whereas it is	a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car	5184.066595803134
13023. there is nothing to	suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original	realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams	2734.467618956391
13024. the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of	a mental image can find no logical support	2599.037318472165
13025. a mental image subconsciously	impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful	thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at	all but is comprised of realities viewed not in the concurrent sensory	stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension	4690.769575890866
13026. dreams	that display events of the future with photographic detail call	for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including	that weird feeling of deja vue inevitably fantastic though	that theory must seem	5760.363400573918
13027. as in the theory of perception established	in psycho-physiology the eye is recognized as an integral part	of the brain	1885.6610316468366
13028. but then this theory confesses that it is completely at	a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain	3699.7074470127363
13029. the	opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative	perception in the book philosophies of science by	albert g ramsperger says h passed on to the brain and there	by some unexplained process it causes the mind to have a perception	4475.037215777553
13030. but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image	within the brain	1182.3089251374759
13031. as retinal images are conceded to be an integral	function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between	the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation	from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the	transmission	of an image which is already in required location	5251.198785455948
13032. hereby	the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen	not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive	cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory	centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness	6813.537661145747
13033. modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists	of minute waves of energy	1094.886037852269
13034. we know that the number of radio and	television impulses sound waves ultra-violet rays etc that may	occupy	the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite	4827.081866900521
13035. so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal	apparently momentary states of matter successive one after	another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of	the progressive frequencies	3754.4731346713866
13036. this theory makes it possible for any	event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to	consciousness	2569.927026998637
13037. space in any form is completely measured by the	three dimensions	504.58134251164995
13038. if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and	not purely metaphysical through what medium does it extend	2364.0203865870626
13039. it is	not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science	fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past	or the ever-existent past-fantasy future	3332.074136153401
13040. three seconds flat is the	usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the	overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static	pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which	perpetuate all events	6289.990773642889
13041. the body senses and brain in common with	all matter have their counterpart on each of a countless number of	frequencies	2016.5838519045926
13042. the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only	of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other	frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them	4624.696265996622
13043. consciousness	is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory	impressions	644.1415969041423
13044. when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the	wakeful world it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present	past and future in a life as vibrant and real as the one left	when the body tired and required sleep	6346.56914950961
13045. if the photographically	realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations	denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded	from views of diverse realities although some of them may never	be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life	4799.455105751662
13046. dr	h v hilprecht professor of assyrian at the university	of pennsylvania dreamed that a babylonian priest associated with	the king kurigalzu escorted him to the treasure	chamber of the temple of bel gave him six novel points of information	about a certain broken relic and corrected an error in its identification	7645.465595137159
13047. as a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result	of many weeks of labor by dr hilprecht was about to be published	by him the following day	2976.5298297716645
13048. some time later the missing part of the relic	was found and the complete inscription together with other new evidence	fully corroborated the ancient priest's information	4095.805318288425
13049. dr	hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest	in his dream	1258.8707632947603
13050. he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite	and imagined it must have been german or english	2583.0843673612385
13051. we may	conclude that all six points of information ostensibly given by the	dream priest could have been furnished by dr hilprecht's	subconscious reasoning	2452.6105520869423
13052. but in denying any physical reality for	this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly	visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or	sudden substitution	4636.512241964455
13053. which theory is more fantastic: 1	43.66359109914477
13054. that the	perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions	in the professor's brain or 2	2361.801298494325
13055. that the dream was a reality on the	infinite progressions of universal gradient frequencies across which	the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met	2723.7256074575334
13056. the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines	whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or	the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling	5036.660693589527
13057. no	doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the	sleeper's mind	1259.8002085141136
13058. probably less than one percent of our previsions	escape final obliteration before we wake	1399.8456158877827
13059. when we arrive at the events	concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot impress	us as anything familiar	1885.2279439664828
13060. nevertheless there are notably frequent	instances of deja vue in which our recognition of an entirely novel	event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which	though vague withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive	corps of psychologists	6687.259014492655
13061. if deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly	it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most	level-headed people	2036.857391858711
13062. chauncey depew one-time runner-up for	the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention	at saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt	for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary	chairman was a man he had never met	6690.59647784126
13063. after the preliminary business	affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech	that clinched the nomination for roosevelt	1887.7065591210091
13064. if depew had told any	academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through	that identical convention session at some time in the past he would	have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue	6310.07096385021
13065. but the famous	orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene	643.7244022201677
13066. he remembered	exactly when he had lived through it before and he had something	to prove he had	2366.757110790409
13067. one week before the convention depew was	seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson gazing at the opposite	shore	2327.849671518427
13068. the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here!	so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents	from north country school lake placid new york	5628.046147125693
13069. in this	one sentence he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition	and psychological programs in operation at the school	2025.6918860615485
13070. because	the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care	for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients	the food does taste good	4838.307299891915
13071. when served in a psychological	atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from	what they eat because they are free from tension a foundation is laid	for a high level of health that releases the children from physical	handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments the	athletic programs and the most important phase the educational opportunities	5583.723505241174
13072. situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain	scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open	fields	and farm lands	3903.674218659287
13073. these contemporary structures beautifully adapted to	a school in the country are home to 60 children ages eight to fourteen	grades four through eight	2467.3011991871067
13074. from fourteen states and three foreign	countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june	2116.8680114678764
13075. the director walter e clark believes that a school	with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility	for their welfare	2451.7110725775574
13076. to him this means caring for the whole child	providing basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom	for the development of the mind	3899.3246275225547
13077. the	concept of good nutrition really began with the garden	375.0762544910667
13078. the school has	always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school	1416.717303618663
13079. in a climate	hostile to agriculture mr clark has had to keep alert to the	most productive farm techniques	1736.4635725016037
13080. where a growing season may	with luck allow 60 days without frost and where the soil is poor	sandy quick-drying and subject to erosion many farmers fail	4280.0632315626735
13081. throughout	the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear	ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat	1567.7868654707468
13082. mr clark	found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers	and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles	of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato	fields and depreciation of the soil	6166.157995434842
13083. to give up these	notions required a revolution in thought mr clark said in reminiscing	about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began	reading organic gardening and modern nutrition in a	search for help with his problems	4221.106705555738
13084. louis bromfield's writings	excited me as a conservationist	251.87760205512686
13085. by 1952 he was convinced he	would no longer spray	375.20613252396146
13086. he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it	still remains	751.2555923481972
13087. after reading plowman's folly by edward h	faulkner he stopped plowing	502.49565454872146
13088. the basis for compost materials	already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the	riding program poultry for eggs pigs to eat garbage a beef herd	and wastes of all kinds	5630.427196729678
13089. separate pails were kept in the kitchen for	coffee grounds and egg shells	789.3162275754274
13090. all these materials and supplementary	manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry	farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year	3713.247435377928
13091. it was applied	with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader	796.9174374667233
13092. years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed	the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity	2820.393218591065
13093. soon after	the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate	his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment	alone that accomplished this	3432.692636159298
13094. to demonstrate the soil	of his vegetable gardens as it is today mr clark stooped to scoop	up a handful of rich dark earth	3688.913793530336
13095. sniffing its sweet smell and letting	it fall to show its good crumbly consistency he pointed to the nearby	driveway and said this soil used to be like that hard packed	road over there	3642.7085383356884
13096. people and soils respond slowly says	walter clark but the time has now come when the gardens produce	delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program	4102.491192960418
13097. no	chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are	used	376.87791330717897
13098. the garden supplies enough carrots turnips rutabagas	potatoes beets cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the	root cellar	3039.201891015979
13099. the carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter;	the cabbage and squash keep until march or april	1570.8056611074426
13100. there is never	enough corn peas or strawberries	251.43351774622812
13101. mr clark still has	to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields but he	has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued	use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in	the	future	4520.542050474893
13102. a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter	563.7203640916891
13103. new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil	treatment	640.4863786930644
13104. after the soil the kitchen says mr clark	250.58349684323622
13105. the	first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of	white bread	933.5538427647604
13106. adults take a long time to convince and you are	thwarted if you try to push	1889.6806303586868
13107. at first the kitchen help was tolerant	but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves	1409.1052458943113
13108. you	can't make french toast with whole-wheat bread was an early	complaint	962.0179270284485
13109. of course they learned in time that they not only could use	whole-wheat bread but the children liked it better	1875.1678573709837
13110. mrs clark as house manager planned the menus and cared for	the ordering	1189.7917145570968
13111. then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be	kitchen manager	502.2734831157337
13112. today whole grains are freshly ground every day and	baked into bread	962.7197989543453
13113. mr clark's studies taught him that the only	way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the	flour	2323.211603672638
13114. once the grains are ground vitamin e begins to deteriorate	immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the	air within one week	4282.886470926609
13115. a mill stands in a room off the kitchen	264.1151449328912
13116. surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in	the state	1413.9555520116933
13117. miss colman pours measures of whole wheat oats and soy	beans and turns on the motor	1259.7417982258853
13118. she goes on about her work and listens	for the completion of the grinding	1415.8184940121841
13119. the bread baked from this mixture	is light in color and fragrant in aroma	942.5550205251417
13120. it is well liked by the children	and faculty	394.9618595103854
13121. there is one problem with the bread	93.87393868620833
13122. lillian's	bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here	that it is hard not to eat too much said the secretary ruefully eyeing	her extra pounds	4623.13790075251
13123. the school has	not used cold prepared cereals for years though at one time that was	all they ever served	1867.2184371370029
13124. when the chance came they first eliminated	cold cereal once a week then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground	cereal every day	3051.735081766452
13125. they serve cracked wheat oats or cornmeal	95.25778950695647
13126. occasionally the children find steamed whole-wheat grains for cereal	which they call buckshot	1173.9129233455865
13127. at the beginning of the school year	the new students don't eat the cereal right away but within a short	time they are eating it voraciously	2731.2942632357503

13147. oranges and grapefruit	are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm	647.2177342229273
13148. finding	sources for these high quality foods is a problem	565.5540578875446
13149. sometimes the	solution comes in unexpected ways	93.72380934128081
13150. following a talk by mr clark	at the new york state natural food associates convention a man	from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school	from vermont	5010.798677661218
13151. wheat-germ brewer's yeast and ground kelp are	used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce meat loaves	1724.3289952116374

13155. drinking with meals	is also discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables	940.3773996203939
13156. the source is known so there is no necessity	to remove insecticide residues	1188.5866911988087
13157. the cooking conserves a maximum	of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very	little water and cook in the shortest time possible	2717.9596369119417
13158. no candy	since mr clark believes firmly that the chewing	of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth raw vegetables and	raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat	cookies at snack time in the afternoons	6306.530000788114
13159. to solve the problem of the	wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot a ball of	maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains	3221.130786992803

13184. vermont's	main railroad line was prostrate	65.12509380153591
13185. and in the dark days after the great	flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster in the state's	history-	the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united	states mails	3438.898805191321
13186. rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen	for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday	november 4 1927 when officials of the post office department's	railway mail service realized that their distribution system for	vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight	7102.705219333079
13187. clerks and postmasters	shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still had offices-	and wondered how to move the mail	2007.0350917427509
13188. the state's railroad system	counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would	obviously remain out of commission for weeks	3026.024796216601

13190. from	burlington outgoing mail could be ferried across lake champlain	to the railroad at port kent n y	2344.5776973406005

13193. when governor al smith offered new york national	guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state it seemed	a likely temporary solution easing burlington's bottleneck and that	at montpelier too	3662.869484494113
13194. the question was where to land	65.44381933097955
13195. there was no such thing as an airport in vermont	374.6005673990644
13196. burlington aviator	john j burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort	ethan allen and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilots	were bringing their wide-winged jenny and dehaviland two-seaters	to rest on the frozen sod of the military base	6329.9200412977525
13197. the only	available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was	on the towne farm off upper main street a narrow hillside where	takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions	3875.751831759206
13198. over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water and	bridges were crumpled and gone	2116.1996920168754

13200. the barre aviation field was set to receive its first	aircraft the sunday following the flood	1885.7708029416474
13201. though the makeshift	airports were ready the york state guard flyers proved unable to	keep any kind of mail schedule	1869.2398708729233
13202. they had courage but their meager training	consisted of weekend hops in good weather in and out of established	airports and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with	the water cooled engines of their world war 1 planes	6161.316714498156
13203. it seemed	like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering	the post office department to contract for the transport of first	class mail by air	3093.7108875157983
13204. they had to act fast for letters were clogging the	terminals	750.2107510826514
13205. down in concord new hampshire was a flier	in the right place at the right time: robert s fogg a native	new englander had been a world war 1 flying instructor barnstormer	and one of the original planners of the concord airport	4411.20818102555
13206. tall	wiry dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical	first in air mail history	1887.0802470816066
13207. piloting a curtiss navy mf flying	boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 he had inaugurated the original	rural delivery air service in america	2330.133301213475

13209. in concord bob	fogg	was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings	788.9228494108415
13210. public-spirited	backers staked him to a brand-new airplane aimed at putting their	city and state on the flying map	2599.109709052851
13211. the ship was a waco biplane one	of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled 225hp	wright radial engine known as the whirlwind	3120.702680619272
13212. a trim green and silver-painted	craft only 22-12 feet long the waco was entered to	compete in the on-to-spokane air derby of 1927	3467.38351441389
13213. as a matter	of fact fogg and his plane didn't get beyond pennsylvania in the	race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service	and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his	wry-faced backers	4301.116957867926
13214. so with all this experience bob fogg was a natural	choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract	3046.97995561764
13215. his work began just six days after the flood	262.5307996006191

13217. the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back	of the state house when the wind was right and used wilson flat	above barre when it wasn't	3438.275784778314
13218. between the unsafe towne field and the	long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to	wilson flat arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory	4826.923446754261
13219. each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal	officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably	on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river	3341.9989118834105
13220. but	fogg they countered we can't get over there	389.03954658845976
13221. and besides you	seem to make it all right here	371.4213211097539
13222. it took a tragedy to bring things	to a head	561.7062146264848
13223. after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind	takeoffs fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage	of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field	3108.078979064094
13224. sent to	montpelier by secretary herbert hoover red cross aide reuben	sleight had been killed and his pilot lt franklin wolfe badly	injured	3493.135248282945
13225. with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply	flown into the hillside	1262.4523055165364
13226. faced with this situation postmaster	charles f mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington	trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights	of berlin	4482.858367820245
13227. a long flat known as the st john field seemed to answer	their purpose and since the winooski bridges were at last passable	they decided to use it	2976.5964209632916
13228. with a wary eye on the farmer's	bull fred somers of montpelier and mr st john marked the	field with a red table cloth	3698.4849153828823
13229. as a wind direction indicator they tied	a cotton rag to a sapling	787.1860706303858
13230. with these aids and a pair of skiis substituting	for wheels on the waco bob fogg made the first landing on	what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21	1927	5343.112248566901
13231. each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail	pouches	500.12915827938497
13232. during the second week of operations fogg received a telegram	from the post office department asking him to put on two airplanes	and make two flights daily plus one sunday trip	5024.162520797666
13233. since	fogg's was a one-man one-plane flying service this meant that he	would have to do both trips flying alone 600 miles a day under sub-freezing	temperature conditions	2995.4006911110146
13234. over the weeks america's	first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the	vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation	4658.3462641541855
13235. each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into	flying togs over the furnace register of his home	2028.0233806128515
13236. always troubled	by poor circulation in his feet he experimented with various combinations	of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's	boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them	5176.95680579639
13237. a sheep-lined	leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed	his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit	1886.2529090292162
13238. the airman's stock answer	to weren't you cold	248.47023292774847
13239. became yes the first half hour	is tough but by then i'm so numb i don't notice it!	as daylight began to show through the frosty windows fogg would	place a call to william a shaw at the u s weather station	at northfield vermont for temperature and wind-velocity readings	4968.257880111466
13240. shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility	by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station	4084.9310548665526
13241. ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights	and cloud positions	641.9071494554807
13242. later on in the day fogg could get a better weather	picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank	e hartwell	3271.5100755355297
13243. out at the airport each morning fogg's	skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running	in the drafty hangar	2326.7360954458954
13244. wishing to show that aviation	was dependable and here to stay bob fogg always made a point	of taking off each morning on the dot of seven disregarding rain snow	and sleet in true postal tradition	5771.816644810149
13245. concord learned to set its clocks	by the rackety bark of the whirlwind's exhaust overhead	1093.8814435751005
13246. sometimes	the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog but 85% of his	trips were completed	2580.1588808910305
13247. plane radios were not yet available	and once in the air fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for	landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick	computation	3764.832139080717
13248. often threading through the overcast he was forced	to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the winooski	or the white river along the line of the broken railroad	5327.716351673504
13249. when	driving rain or mist socked in one valley fogg would chandelle up	and over to reverse course and try another one ranging from the ottauquechee	up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain	passes	4059.371194684176
13250. the dependable wright engine was never stopped on	these trips	559.0981121678892
13251. it ticked over smoothly idling while fogg exchanged	mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen	and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field	3238.455622679746
13252. sometimes on a return trip the aviator would go upstairs high	over the clouds	1427.7937811630313
13253. there he'd take a compass heading figure his	air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over	the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe	to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him	4831.508744917359
13254. bob fogg didn't have today's advantages of instrument flight	and ground control approach systems	1400.5465150550735
13255. at the end of the calculated	time he'd nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break	through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable	3343.208733367206
13256. usually back in concord by noon there was just time	to get partially thawed out refuel and grab a bit of mrs fogg's	hot broth before starting the second trip	4822.005006547892
13257. day after day fogg shuttled	back and forth on his one-man air mail route until the farmers	in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the	stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country	4219.3638748298745
13258. the	flyer had his share of near-misses	139.35557196663095
13259. at fort ethan allen the ever-present	wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing	like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated	2466.0392099824367
13260. once the soldiers from	the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved	the engine and got the tail up	3720.1551093833173
13261. at a nod of his head they let go	turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream	1574.4151871314673
13262. tracks in the	snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet	1639.4868743014376
13263. one afternoon during a cold powdery snowstorm fogg took off for	concord from the st john field	1432.1105423672284

13338. then again there's always that	lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs	1187.7576615479493
13339. not for me but perhaps	just the thing for you	376.4058569740142
13340. well! how's about mosaic	tile ceramics or similar arts and crafts	751.9048081825283

13343. do you yearn to make cakes and pies or special cookies	and candies	793.485028628785

13346. some make beautiful chairs cabinets chests doll	houses etc	393.04288413393203
13347. perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried	to see what you could do with a hunk of wood	2032.2401267779867
13348. outside of cutting your	fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again	you might turn out some dandy little gadgets	3895.516290090955
13349. some women get	a real thrill out of housework	260.947928511457

13355. ever since i was a	child i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing	1565.5642949355365
13356. if you do	decide to write you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips	and dejection	1882.994511976578
13357. don't be discouraged! this is just being a normal	writer	379.6161878465242
13358. just let the rejection slips fall where they may and keep	on plugging and finally you will make the grade	2825.052122341533
13359. few new writers have	their first story accepted so they tell me	636.7341984750444
13360. but it could happen	and it may happen to you	557.6863916334398
13361. then there's always hobbies collecting	stamps coins timetables salt and pepper shakers elephants	dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart	desires	2735.3718789087243

13363. you say	but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby	783.792913254946
13364. i haven't got that	kind of money	139.11602521848843
13365. true! it does cost a lot of money for	most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free	1728.297928467391
13366. how about a rock	collection or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs	and in different colors	2596.204985146866
13367. then take flowers	0.20041515
13368. they are many and varied	22.389734642467648
13369. also there's scrap books collecting newspaper pictures and	clippings or any items of interest to you	1253.1749652739954
13370. it's getting interested	in something that counts	140.39731832114518
13371. as for me i am holding in reserve	two huge puzzles to put together when time hangs	heavy on my hands	2020.8293405120598
13372. so far the covers have never been off the	boxes	563.4459855679008
13373. i just don't have time to do half the things i want to do now	1098.38206214981
13374. so in closing fellow retired members i advise you to make	the most of each day enjoy each one to the n'th degree	3491.209144153436
13375. keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life	and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to	be sunshine sweet	2992.7579109066523
13376. good luck! to one and all- good days	ahead!	n important criterion of maturity is creativity	1873.0388799123903
13377. the mature	person	is creative	14.883033863494498
13378. what does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing	frequency these days	1887.9850317953103
13379. when we turn to noah webster we find	him helpful as usual	638.5271737001341
13380. to be creative is to have the ability to	cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth	an original production of human intelligence or power	4648.468593316693
13381. we are creative	it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed	938.7964603336635
13382. thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake building	a chicken coop or producing a book to founding a business creating	a league of nations or developing a mature character	5389.40707004174
13383. all	living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence	the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their	own	3003.5515360429486
13384. while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors	in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true	non-instinctive and conscious creative ability	4295.765783877951
13385. an animal bird or	insect creates either a burrow or nest or hive in unending sameness	according to specie	1734.798204802976
13386. man's great superiority over these evolutionary	forbears is in the development of his imagination	1411.4287133408034
13387. this gives him the	power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas	and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment	in new and ever-changing forms	3654.037287271255
13388. t has been	truly said	that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting	this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world	4309.244451245457
13389. in our	own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne	come into actuality	1567.967346734652
13390. the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a	poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of	1941	3715.4212608092407
13391. in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's	projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more	2328.836896626233
13392. it	is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image	of his creator	2797.9300362310014
13393. not only can man project his imagination	out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly	he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself	3432.7892692727337
13394. we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training	can become athletes acrobats dancers musicians and artists developing	many potentialities	3288.8933415918173
13395. we know that actors can learn to portray	a wide variety of character roles	943.7064022104307
13396. by this same combination of the	will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently	the kind of character we would like to be	4478.95284244146
13397. we must realize with	prof charles morris in his the open self that man is the	being that can continually remake himself the artisan that is himself	the material for his own creation	3554.7465264256425
13398. o far in	history man	has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment	rather than first creating the sort of person who can make	the highest use of the things he has created	5771.875137824496
13399. is not the present world	crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us	and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall	the tragedy	3230.0772781464893
13400. is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend	our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our	own maturing process	4293.851328987107
13401. sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness	of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in	being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood	under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long	period after the decline of his procreativity	5149.785558045291
13402. some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples	are a thing of the remote victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners	are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough	from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all	the anxiety and hazards out of the situation	7332.078490425591
13403. perhaps- but extensive	discussions with contemporary practitioners family doctors and	gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance	2032.412735097177
13404. joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual	information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men	and women	3691.5737408138375
13405. various factors in the setting can still be of great	advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad	memory for one or both	2873.7959030377697
13406. privacy must be highly assured both in time and	place	564.0883288737932
13407. that is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of	location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough	for an utterly unhurried fulfillment	3092.7092198214596
13408. if the wedding party lasted	late and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before	resuming the trip or making an early start the husband may forestall	tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying	in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours	7637.691937793813
13409. the	consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long	private time for that purpose	1715.5946276586699
13410. first intercourse	for the bride brings with it the various problems connected	with virginity and the hymen	2125.084534849984
13411. one thing should be clear to	both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur	when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act	2985.0699083224054
13412. ignorance on this	point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding	and suspicion	1648.8511345445572
13413. the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane	that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most	female human beings who have not had sex relations	3224.9227970834527
13414. often it is thin and fragile	and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse	2827.9356490288255
13415. as might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little	and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity	2309.1836425339993
13416. it is also important to realize that many girls are born without	a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that the absence	of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex	relations	6706.641914783229
13417. but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations	of the folk-lore beliefs	942.3677856821047
13418. some hymens are so strongly developed that	they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked	loss of blood	3252.399435698549
13419. more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not	yield to penetration	938.9976519183143
13420. extreme cases are on record in which the	doctor	has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital	relations to be consummated	4090.0384464953886
13421. these cases for all their rarity are	so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general	population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen	is a serious problem to newly-weds	3957.793391687746
13422. in recent times when sexual	matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly	the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention	3480.5103012425475
13423. obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new	situation	786.7721717828365
13424. is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of	making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride	3706.521046174709
13425. gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride	should consult a physician before marriage	1262.5277926041808
13426. if he foresaw any problem	because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple	procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably	to dilate it	4965.451370442148
13427. as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was	often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for	painless intercourse by dilating the vagina	2596.5259483085383
13428. this recommendation	was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth	consummation of the sex act	3254.132623053413
13429. the vagina is an organ capable of	remarkable contraction and dilation	504.7232489523535
13430. this is obvious when it is remembered	that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit	the passage of the baby	3264.5219111704882
13431. the intricate system of muscles that	manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under	voluntary control	1727.0320011141364
13432. but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious	intention of the woman	1185.3388985706226
13433. that is when first penetration takes	place the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the	vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent	further pain	3460.217427428424
13434. the advantages	of dilatation by the physician	are both physical and psychological	962.7032446213191
13435. since it is a purely professional	situation none of the pain is associated with love-making or the	beloved	1574.8060329491168
13436. by using instruments of gradually increasing size the vagina	is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to	an object of the appropriate shape	4477.922768821727
13437. in this process the vaginal	muscles come under better conscious control by the girl	944.2982295575039
13438. she learns	how to relax them to accept- instead of contracting them to repel	the entering object	2110.639893923879
13439. apart from the standard problem of	controlling the vaginal muscles other serious barriers may exist that	need special gynecological treatment	1867.433326048739
13440. it is far better to have such	conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon	where they can create a really serious situation	4467.2628131561305
13441. when no	medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to	cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves	2170.350243604633
13442. special	information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still	of great value	1183.9628096753431
13443. folk-lore superstition and remembered passages from	erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly	taken as scientific facts and useful hints	2340.9221273706944
13444. the importance	of loving tenderness is obvious	141.87875909401885
13445. the long unhurried approach and	the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels	946.1499764806225
13446. under	the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes	and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases providing an excellent	lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration	4662.063504640939
13447. extensive	observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established	the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall	may cause	a great deal of distress in a virgin	3229.847872673343
13448. but during the same examination	two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall	without any pain; and in	fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all	times	5140.657626269841
13449. these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may	be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse	1248.751547413645
13450. the husband	and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in	mind	1186.27869707976
13451. they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too	much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at	least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer	a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making	4610.770701154027
13452. in	fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely	adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon	3243.977293802215
13453. locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing	the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration	2618.2091798482807
13454. the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain	while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased	with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling	the problem once and for all	6447.551861035188
13455. such talk is seriously in error	43.346618784575625
13456. ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride	both physically and psychologically	2128.1236828341653
13457. the insistent forceful penetration	may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage	to the hymen	1888.4151453068928
13458. the pain and distress associated with	the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital	relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant	and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate	his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it	7321.182625880703
13459. serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in	the honeymoon situation	938.6761923748575
13460. the necessity for keeping alert to his bride's	hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous	desire	2603.2818052896423
13461. the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience	a premature climax	940.1660746759208
13462. this is a very common experience and should in	no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife	2368.86972703427
13463. or the	frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of	the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him	to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period	3943.5743853479717
13464. the signals	to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to	take advantage of them	2343.4470580037755
13465. the best course is to recover his physical	excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again	1721.125104477193
13466. this	may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding	and self-centered	1652.5396408407546
13467. he can take security from the fact that the	progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost	2033.86865229528
13468. now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride	will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him	restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they	both so eagerly desire	5942.257228695888
13469. the accumulated information	on this point shows that first intercourse even when it is achieved	with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual	experience to a woman	3111.4426129561252
13470. too many new things are happening for it to	be a complete erotic fulfillment	1406.226022959162
13471. only under rare circumstances	would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse	945.7391246036641
13472. both	man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and	even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that	the wife may be cold or frigid	5767.43320665853
13473. if the early approaches are wise	understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment	will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older	2458.4397759535673
13474. writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures	titled the nude: a study in ideal form kenneth	clark declares: h the human body as a nucleus is rich in associations	5509.923582271042
13475. h it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things	we wish to do with ourselves	1409.3408552588112
13476. perhaps this is a clue to	the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated	by the nude form	3058.193995423143
13477. the wide divergence of reactions	is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality	1094.4762981748756
13478. differences were related to social economic and educational backgrounds	393.7305909816301
13479. whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt	to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth	grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations	3439.1976218177324
13480. such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating	thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that	her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman	boasting an equal number of years of married life is proud of having	shared the nudist way of life- the really free natural nude	life- for most of that period	8320.116836902189
13481. attempts at censorship always	involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions	786.9646643717232
13482. the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude	human form as lewd	and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good	or religious or moral persons	4695.3434371233625
13483. the equally ardent proponent	of	freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the	natural honest free expression of man's spirit and the epitome	of beauty and inspiration	3437.4144169173805
13484. one is always a little surprised	to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected	1877.1835988571152
13485. i	still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic	advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life	in nudism who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution	in fine spirit	3937.4645052598353
13486. in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place	of unity and harmony	1649.191043951676
13487. the partners each bring to it unselfish love	and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy	1727.6484770744341
13488. at its	most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly	cares	1414.8135933056851
13489. everything else is closed away	14.788696625170266
13490. but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy	are seldom achieved	1409.1699340015207
13491. instead one partner or the other dominates the	sexual relationship	377.5272626861932
13492. in the past it has been the husband who has been	dominant and the wife passive	1884.5135822091975
13493. but today there are signs that these	roles are being reversed	504.04371810981365
13494. in a growing number of american homes	marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role	in sexual relationships	2816.909780397456
13495. it is she who decides the time the place	the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act	1576.3545373445154
13496. it is she who	says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-	not the husband	2817.772815020787
13497. the whole act is tailored to her pleasure	and not to theirs	638.0747143119911
13498. beyond a certain point of course	no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that	1885.257401485948
13499. but there is little	doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed	1412.273663620058
13500. of course there remain many old-fashioned marriages in	which the husband maintains his supremacy	1401.7399212999478
13501. yet even in these marriages	psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly	791.224154977938
13502. the	meekest most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's	or grandmother's standards	1891.92892678405
13503. to many experts this trend was	inevitable	93.35268154689449
13504. they consider it simply a sign of our times	389.0678122316255
13505. our society	has emancipated the woman giving her new independence and new	authority	789.9956472662022
13506. it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual	role	956.5297622783822
13507. the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum	declares dr mary steichen calderone medical director of the	planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent	book release from sexual tensions	3564.750628608423
13508. it reflects what is going	on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself	1882.0067916334337
13509. a world	in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual	relationships in which wives are more self-assertive too	2452.221152339266
13510. yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination	of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy	and even dangerous	3917.636626177521
13511. it can in fact wreck a marriage	94.68184045179419
13512. when	a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires she	is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her	3701.86696520829
13513. and she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy	504.9780909916931
13514. on the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his self-respect	and robs him of his masculinity	2365.021645288232
13515. he is a target of ridicule	to his wife and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-	to the outside world as well	2315.68550550652
13516. a marriage can survive almost	any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's	maleness declares dr calderone	3245.8216695602996
13517. this opinion is supported	by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists dr maurice	e linden director of the mental health division of the philadelphia	department of public health	2974.278705691436
13518. when the roles of	husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the	husband follower dr linden says the effects on their whole	relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous	5477.596690507917
13519. in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office	worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband	unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded	3097.9604505796287
13520. to win her favors her	husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle	from his employer	2579.6603217210313
13521. caught at last he was sentenced to prison	166.4232666327345
13522. while	he was in custody his wife divorced him	389.7983841978504
13523. more typical is	the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage	counselor	1261.4904736151343
13524. this woman repeatedly complained she was too tired	for marital relations	753.6234044494529
13525. to please her her husband assumed some of the	domestic chores	502.47233778365046
13526. finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the	children and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations	as often as he desired them	4107.385468621624
13527. one wife described by a	new york psychologist so dominated her husband that she actually placed	their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between	the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood	card parties	3948.3466131939194
13528. another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis	141.3444551819261
13529. after	every money argument she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the	matter was settled in her favor	1406.012467392778
13530. experts say the partners in	marriages like these can almost be typed	963.0234770727405
13531. the wife is likely	to be young sophisticated smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed	a promising career for marriage	2343.794374158087
13532. she knows the power of the	sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband	2105.302426684264
13533. the husband	is usually a well-educated professional preoccupied with his job-	often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: don't	rock the boat	2606.2903419642307
13534. sometimes this leads to his becoming	demandingly dominant in marriage	558.8931642792455
13535. hemmed in on the job and unable to	assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one	area	2605.1147946935625
13536. more often though he is so accustomed to submitting	to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule	at home	3896.414740639078
13537. some psychologists in fact suggest that career-bound	husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their	wives	1714.9791545448588
13538. the wife's attempt at control these psychologists contend	is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay	as much attention to her as he does to his job	4987.629376240935
13539. naturally no	woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative	377.50434213552955
13540. unless her	husband also desires sex the act cannot be consummated	757.0167522829679
13541. generally	however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wife's	mercy	1097.3810718488621
13542. the pattern says dr morton	schillinger	psychologist at new york's lincoln institute for psychotherapy	is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually	trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight	is the night	6442.464014351042
13543. no one seriously contends of course that	the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world	1728.2762885143263
13544. after all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic	figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr schillinger	points out	4276.416809361692
13545. there is no evidence that these milquetoasts	became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master	bedroom	1720.78657506893
13546. furthermore dr calderone says a certain	number of docile retiring men always have been around	1648.7366678924184
13547. they aren't	frigid and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained	in all of life	941.5271407364069
13548. they like to be dominated	22.25828649547726
13549. one such man once	confided to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he	preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor	2185.8984249883492
13550. asked why he replied	primly: because that's no activity for a gentleman	967.3237953336999
13551. but such cases were in the past unusual	166.53478505161766
13552. society here and abroad	has been built around the dominating male- even the bible appears	to endorse the concept	2610.253951941523
13553. family survival on our own western frontier	for example could quite literally depend on a man's strength	and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom	questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed	4057.559644658201
13554. this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early	20th centuries when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring	life with father manner	4300.886631303043
13555. in those days a wife had mighty	few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere	1888.676467574526
13556. grandma wasn't expected to like it dr marion hilliard	the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of the	'90s	3053.981929853685
13557. wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as	used by their husbands- and history indicates they often quite	literally were	2016.7038697118733
13558. when was the turning point	22.05232500560333
13559. when did women	begin to assert themselves sexually	166.83268714379898
13560. some date it from	woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men	in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper	and bathtub gin	4828.119716626192
13561. virtually everyone agrees however that the trend	toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with	the postwar rush to the suburbs	2037.5098892051942
13562. left alone while her husband	was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties	normally reserved for the male	3704.8110300387198
13563. circumstances gave her almost undisputed	sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance	644.7748618457892
13564. she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was	once considered too helpless	2353.1417512373787
13565. she liked this taste of authority and	independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up	1570.0052965352904
13566. very few wives says dr calderone who balance the checkbook	fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with	the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned	5509.333411949109
13567. a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the	sexual relationship as well	943.6281584748858
13568. and an additional factor was	helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively	recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response	3874.221864816662
13569. marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the	importance of the female climax	1099.0030810951603
13570. they began to describe in detail the	woman's capacity for response	754.2497546503166
13571. in fact the noted psychologist	and sex researcher dr albert ellis has declared flatly that	women are sexually superior to men	2027.9486369213137
13572. according to dr ellis	the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual	arousal than her partner	2580.239722633352
13573. not surprisingly dr ellis says	some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities	1100.8686876323993
13574. yet paradoxically according to dr maurice linden many	wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them	2339.3548689038007
13575. an aggressive	woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under	500.9343329507213
13576. when the husband	becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness dr	linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate	3262.5312376006145
13577. often she	fails to gain sexual satisfaction	94.0365141766692
13578. one such wife dr	linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through	a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger	man	4464.330434219103
13579. but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until	that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity	2027.0620532385742
13580. then the	wife bed-hopped to the next on the list	563.1714817595667
13581. in some cases however	domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered	by a passing but urgent emotional need	2334.91931020004
13582. thus a man who is butting	a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed-	the one place he can still be champion	4102.756869856373
13583. if his on-the-job problems work	out he may return to his old pattern	786.1560128398694
13584. sometimes a burst of aggressiveness	will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels	age creeping up	3054.636561414463
13585. on the other hand a husband who always has	been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking	psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable	3090.337453198564
13586. or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered	or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted	3032.0839824371938
13587. in any case	dr calderone remarks such problems are a couple's own affair	and can't always be measured by a general yardstick	2198.3318690410765
13588. as long	as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little	difference if one or the other dominates dr calderone declares	4102.974241109403
13589. the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment	505.80740242287163
13590. other experts say however that if sexual domination	by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period	it is likely to shake the marriage	4482.643926312196
13591. and just as domination today often	begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband	1732.9512873447834
13592. to get a marriage back where it belongs comments dr	schillinger of the lincoln institute the husband must take	some very basic steps	3493.5494538722487
13593. he must begin paradoxically by becoming more	selfish	167.8126664814591
13594. he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding	and less 'understanding'	1421.77031449572
13595. too many husbands dr	schillinger continues worry about how well they're doing	and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual	play	2730.017296674302
13596. she gave herself a title h lady diana harrington	396.38663822926054
13597. the new york da gave her another h the golden girl	of cafe society	942.297430657249
13598. houston police gave her a third less flamboyant	title h prostitute	753.7747153466554
13599. and houston police have the final	say in the matter since she died there on september 20 1960 diane	harris graham 30 doa circumstances- unusual	2616.899644131977
13600. early in her life she had discovered that where there were men	there was money and with the two came luxury and liquor	3480.067022327699
13601. she was still	in the play for pay business when she died a top trollop who had	given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour	3097.868413036497
13602. she never hid the fact that she liked to play	559.6926182777436
13603. her neighbors	in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that	the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as	the golden	girl of the mickey jelke trial	3226.1431769536
13604. it was the trial of	oleomargarine heir minot jelke for compulsory prostitution	in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl	3483.8803583085346
13605. diane was needed as a material	witness in the case and new york police searched three continents	before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel	of course	3453.5196357324085
13606. she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington	a name that made some of the gossip columns	2833.4279119137186
13607. it was when	she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation	she liked best	1582.7016222269917
13608. clad in mink and diamonds she listened to assistant	district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning	judge:   this girl is the golden girl of cafe society	4482.214174480601
13609. in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county	375.1910273939865
13610. in	the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign	tycoon who took her to france where she later met a very wealthy man	and toured all europe with him	5454.812518440675
13611. at deauville she met an	egyptian by the name of pulley bey	641.9997927622113
13612. he was the official procurer for	king farouk now in exile	748.6338023269284
13613. she was in egypt during the revolution	and had passport difficulty	503.95701291954356
13614. she lied in order to get it	139.47527746769566
13615. we	have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally	back into this country h she has been acting as a prostitute	2601.493816383004
13616. our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts	to jelke	1173.149103599831
13617. diane sobbingly denied this to the court	93.84559766250345
13618. i never gave that boy a cent	140.1187632452362
13619. i am not a prostitute	and i had only one very wealthy boy friend she said	1268.2608531423746
13620. during the course of the trial jelke backed up part of that statement	1169.5212598225853
13621. diane is the type of girl jelke said who wouldn't	get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up	all your money in the middle of the floor	3222.2613199964976
13622. but she seemed to	have underestimated the number of her boy friends	957.8361802300631
13623. she	came to new york from detroit as a teenager but with a sponsor	instead of a chaperone	1583.4694805051622
13624. as she told it he's a rich boy friend	an old guy about 60	1415.9236157863165
13625. she was mary lou brew then wide-eyed	but not naive	372.7645210602087
13626. she had talked her boy friend into sending her	to new york to take a screen test	2118.6071859127687
13627. the screen test was never made- but diane was	261.57647863168893
13628. she quickly	moved into cafe society possibly easing her conscience by talking	constantly of her desire to be in show business	3034.701696408593
13629. she seemed	so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail	circuit set up a practical joke	2331.275246960988
13630. an ex-fighter was introduced	to her in a bar as mr warfield the famous producer	1648.7078329658739
13631. the	phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows	1258.6797876702253
13632. i'd love to audition for you she gushed	251.4680487780719
13633. the	audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment	498.8432860985546
13634. she	thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show	the eminent producer how well she could dance	3060.974902209967
13635. after a few minutes	he said i can't use you if you dance like that	1102.2900612531432
13636. i'd like	to see you dance nude	142.13204100725682
13637. diane loved	to dance in the nude something she was to demonstrate time and again	1095.8631000665723
13638. she developed another quaint habit	22.224667168285837
13639. even among the fast set	in which she was moving her method for keeping an escort from departing	too early was unique	2161.2202479392736
13640. when the date would try to bid her	good-night at the door she would tell him if you go home now i'll	scream	3488.0179591274305
13641. more often than not he would bow to the inevitable	376.02809525074355
13642. one who needed no such threats was a french financier	562.9579437398868
13643. one of	the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel	499.3938928406193
13644. she wanted	to go around the world but she settled for a french holiday	1426.3708941851146
13645. in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told	of spending several months with her	1410.1240812028086
13646. then she went to deauville	where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers	2120.4958502180784
13647. the greek evidently fell for her monsieur x recounted	and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he	gave her 100000 francs and led her to the roulette tables	3546.8502970962736
13648. she could do no wrong at the tables that time	560.1928503534615
13649. and in short	order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way	790.1224969880711
13650. smarter	than most gamblers she slipped away from the casino packed her bag	and took the night train to paris	2831.5022702784545
13651. no one ever learned what happened	to the greek	260.8427329763248
13652. the luxury of paris' most fashionable hotel	the george 5 bored the beautifully-built blonde so she high-tailed	it to rome	2834.4080803256243
13653. she teamed up with another beauty whose	name has been lost to history and commenced with some fiddling that	would have made nero envious	2462.2047838611434
13654. to climax her roman revels she	was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked	through its marble halls screaming for help	4095.7463665650052
13655. it was a rugged	finish for what must have been a very interesting night	942.4340437934316

13664. in the morning	she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally	luxurious hotel ambassador	2125.2408085050647
13665. with the ambassador as headquarters	she continued to promote good will abroad	639.8720950593876
13666. of course her benevolence	was limited to those who could afford it but then there is a	limit to what one person can do	3682.0545655249066
13667. by this time diane was a beguiling	lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world	1573.8211074180122

13673. pulley	bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him the friend	continued	789.4076669997798
13674. it seemed as though she were always auditioning	249.87546459132264
13675. no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors the plump	pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she	waited for nine months vainly hoping to see farouk	3438.7810030000533
13676. pulley	had set her up at the semiramis hotel but she grew impatient waiting	for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the	royal pimp had no key	5183.9395149821385
13677. she picked her own middle-eastern friends	from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her	1255.6731930121186
13678. tewfik	badrawi mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of	cairo society enjoyed her company	1644.2861890799663
13679. so extensive became her	circle of admirers egyptian police said that her escapades	caused distrust	1087.359289316871
13680. the roof was about ready to fall in on diane's	little world but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution	to bring it down	3875.2881280566316
13681. when farouk was overthrown police picked up	his personal pimp pulley bey	643.6753706743372
13682. they also called upon diane with	a request for a look at her passport	1418.5976988558616
13683. the cagey pulley bey	who spoke no english had taken the passport so that diane	couldn't	leave the country without his approval	2176.3618289703763
13684. officials provided a temporary	passport good only for return to the united states	1184.007220573644
13685. and	return to the united states she did into waiting arms- the unromantic	ones of the new york district attorney's office	2033.09103538985
13686. held	as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey	jelke the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed	to the women's house of detention a terribly overcrowded prison	5474.662568186817

13688. newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated	that she was co-operating with the district attorney	2106.245145298271

13692. houston police got to know diane two years ago	when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring	3492.4301698980075
13693. last may they said she admitted being a prostitute	262.6284770114621
13694. the	next time the police saw her she was dead	562.909397266219
13695. it was september	20 1960 in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles	943.7655183727505
13696. she had had a party with a regular visitor dr william w	mcclellan	1187.2215362315135

13702. pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the	walls	749.3168389184516
13703. an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane's	body	497.62572581284303
13704. police theorize that a combination of dope drink and	drugs killed her	955.8603208996462
13705. i think that maybe she wanted it this way	a vice squad cop said	937.8598682980271
13706. a maid told us that she still bragged	about getting $50 a date	1178.6535998410427
13707. she was on the junk and they slide fast when	that happens	636.2287235954939
13708. at least she never knew what the bottom was	like	560.31309690547
13709. i am a carpet salesman	14.699219043499408
13710. i work for one of the biggest chains	of retail carpet houses in the east	1645.1631100014097
13711. we cater mostly to nice people	in the $5-8000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy	neon-lit chromium-plated suburban stores	2325.06855574222
13712. i am selling the	stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams- wall-to-wall	carpeting	2119.2810045908886
13713. there is only one trouble with this big	beautiful dream	374.0040611122488
13714. from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare	566.525088976465
13715. people come to me with confidence	43.30754605614211
13716. they depend on my supposedly	expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little	1878.893334737951
13717. but i knowingly abuse their confidence	43.81463547533686
13718. franklin d lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs	claire shaefer accompanied by a friend visited him in bakersfield	california several months ago as a prospective patient	4653.841239925934
13719. doctor	lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes	939.3269009307242
13720. then	by squeezing her foot three times he came up- presto- with a	different diagnosis with each squeeze	2354.1179103647537
13721. she had- he informed her-	kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder	937.4661963485232
13722. that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because	he knew just the	thing for her- a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator	machine	4311.168193635599
13723. as he applied the applicator extending from the	machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed	on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions	of mrs shaefer's body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific	mumbo-jumbo	4240.292360036982
13724. yes the ozone from his machine would cure practically	everything he assured her	1190.080704451635
13725. did she know he asked why the	colors of the tubes were important to people's health	1250.118074248648
13726. the human	body- he pointed out for example- required 33 units of blue light	1407.2488280327086
13727. for that reason he informed her the lord made the sky blue	644.8181521871298
13728. continuing	glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her:   don't	you worry	1178.4651345869536
13729. this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body	94.18594122612393
13730. cancer! mrs shaefer practically shrieked	22.289416534309545
13731. you	didn't tell me i had cancer	93.94046638631472
13732. you have it all right	22.18372370888455
13733. but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing	to worry about	1425.0864669317564
13734. why i once used this machine to cure a woman with	97 pounds of cancer in her body	2352.8626763433085
13735. he urged her to buy one	of his machines- for $300	498.5626923417117
13736. when she said that she didn't have the	money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office	model until she was ready to buy one	4631.314778848504
13737. he then sold her minerals to cure	her kidney ailment a can of sage to make her look like a girl again	and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away	3546.577707930626
13738. lee renewed his pressure on mrs shaefer to buy his machine	when she visited him the next day	2356.797383159597
13739. after another treatment with the machine	he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors	and cysts	1870.9553405896647
13740. he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would	take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money	for buying his machine	4293.13750756572
13741. when she submitted to his treatment with	the capsules mrs shaefer felt intense pain	941.0145063245848
13742. leaving lee's	office mrs shaefer hurried over to her family physician who treated	her for burned tissue	2102.7343332645423
13743. for several days she was ill as a result	of lee's treatment	640.9096269466374
13744. mrs shaefer never got around to	joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30000 for his ozone	machines	3054.8063618948627
13745. for mrs shaefer- who had been given a clean bill	of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee- and her	friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection	bureau	3848.970572760301
13746. and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the	evidence of lee's quack shenanigans gathered by the tape recorder	under her friend's clothing proved adequate in court for convicting	franklin d lee	5307.6183072234835
13747. the charge: violation of the california medical	practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling	misbranded drugs	1735.9141364214022
13748. the sentence: 360 days' confinement in the	county jail	393.07070228362744
13749. an isolated case of quackery	14.838495592598955
13750. by no means	0.30041514999999996
13751. rather	it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic	devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands	of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them	away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases	4582.659962520376
13752. the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and	ends of metals wires and radio parts	2575.7787757543565
13753. with these gadgets-	impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs ticks	and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game capitalizing	on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of	our scientific age	4132.718545913588
13754. he milks the latest scientific advances translating	them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his	fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual	impotence and cancer	5356.746887307125
13755. the gadget faker operates or sells his	phony machines for $5 to $10000-	anything the traffic will bear	1571.0976630068524
13756. he	may call himself a naprapath a physiotherapist an electrotherapist	a naturopath a sanipractor a medical cultist a masseur a doctor-	or what have you	3922.6235136534183
13757. not only do these quacks assume impressive	titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific	or impressive foundations-	foundations which often have little	more than a letterhead existence	3228.17738822194
13758. the medical device pirate	of today of course is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor	of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and	other patent medicines	4653.7734559122655
13759. his plunder is therefore far higher- running	into hundreds of millions	501.00554411474633
13760. according to the food and drug	administration doctor ghadiali dr albert	abrams and his clique and dr wilhelm reich- to name three notorious	device quacks- succeeded respectively in distributing 10000	5000 and 2000 fake health machines	5794.986908031748
13761. authorities believe	that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are	still in business	1417.2457759668796
13762. look at the sums paid by two device quack victims	in cleveland	962.7947613444001
13763. sarah gross a dress shop proprietor paid $1020 to	a masseur and mr a a laborer paid $4200 to a chiropractor for	treatment with two fake health machines- the radioclast and	the diagnometer	3573.369157423829
13764. multiply these figures by the millions of people	known to be conned by medical pirates annually	1870.1895018730568
13765. you will come up	with a frightening total	167.22273603666397
13766. that's why the fda the american	medical association and the national better business	bureau have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery	to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical	charlatans annually	5940.043564493019
13767. the postmaster general recently reported	that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices	figure prominently- are at the highest level in history	2319.184203011252
13768. similarly	the american cancer society the arthritis and rheumatism	foundation and the bbb have each stated lately that medical	quackery is at a new high	3916.1625650432784
13769. for example the bbb has reported	it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and	10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago	3000.7694636643073
13770. authorities	hesitate to quote exact figures however believing that any	sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by	their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical	racketeer	5607.466147703778
13771. in this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony	device quackery are conservative	947.6320420635697
13772. the economic toll that	the device quack extracts is important of course	959.9927446159843
13773. but it is our health-	more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern	witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away	2866.7883870199175
13774. by preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate	by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care these medical	ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity	5501.047040828684
13775. typically	sarah gross and mr a both lost more than their money	as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks	2183.792786227811
13776. sarah	gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment	by the masseur were not helping her	2583.4849021228256
13777. as a result she consulted medical	authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was	using were phony	1725.3531939765385
13778. she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be	institutionalized	560.3448649456981
13779. mr a her fellow townsman also experienced	a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been	bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been	treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease multiple	sclerosis- and himself	4696.27764120123
13780. mr a has recovered but he is	justifiably a bitter man	751.3605774187483
13781. that's a lot of hard-earned money to	lose he says today	499.73504625208625
13782. neither me nor my wife were helped by that	chiropractor's treatments	743.742634356604
13783. and there was the case of tom	hepker a machinist who was referred by a friend to a health machine	quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what	doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine	4361.80758427084
13784. after	his pains got worse tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he	learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung	3709.5801068182445
13785. yes tom caught	it in time to stay alive	260.06370827903163
13786. but he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-	thanks to this modern witch doctor	1643.8933141715945
13787. but the machine quack	can cause far more than just suffering	502.58450635215996
13788. in such diseases as cancer	tuberculosis and heart disease early diagnosis and treatment are so	vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud's	cure-all gadget can prove fatal	5165.678251057769
13789. moreover the diabetic patient who relies	on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake	can be committing suicide	2321.8606706832425
13790. for instance:   in chicago	some time ago mr h age 27 a diabetic since he was six stopped	using	insulin because he had bought a magic spike- a glass tube	about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small	fraction of a cent- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306	as a cure-all	8222.724421365025
13791. hang this around your neck or attach it to other	parts of your anatomy and its rays will cure any disease you have	said the company	2726.037885497357
13792. mr h is dead today because he followed this	advice	559.593726201754
13793. doris hull suffering from tuberculosis was taken	by her husband to see otis g carroll a sanipractor- a licensed	drugless healer- in spokane	2319.8800721736357
13794. carroll diagnosed mrs hull by	taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic	machine and twirling some knobs	3686.4787925279547
13795. his prescription:	hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water	635.6484150645364
13796. although	she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him carroll permitted	her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water	4098.576653160025
13797. inevitably mrs hull died of starvation and tuberculosis weighing	60 pounds	501.8581520670541
13798. moreover her husband and child contracted tb	from her	393.2422607040859
13799. in california a few years ago a ghoul	by the name of h f bell sold electric blankets as a cure	for cancer	2338.67600560062
13800. he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric	blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died	reconditioning them and selling them at $185 each	5163.718333661278
13801. when authorities	convicted him of practicing medicine without a license	a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of	one of his victims was not around to testify: he was dead of	cancer	3844.762813541352
13802. by no means are these isolated cases	141.5328870422171
13803. unfortunately	says chief postal inspector david h stephens who has prosecuted	many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of	the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the	patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up	in court	4739.690160887652
13804. death! have no doubt about it	64.91267396556813
13805. that's	where device quackery can lead	43.889852969163165
13806. the evidence shows that fake therapeutic	machines substituted for valid medical cures have hastened the	deaths of thousands	2337.2880287731705
13807. who are the victims of the device quacks	168.6241591088855
13808. authorities say that oldsters are a prime target	251.30822368058088
13809. says wallace	f jannsen director of the fda's division of public information:	quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older	people or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis rheumatism	diabetes and cancer	3859.1928907861134
13810. people who have not been able to get	relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in	by quacks	3252.2284244779553
13811. the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people like	mr a who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice	to doctor fraud's avarice	2863.7127718224115
13812. they are often ignorant as well as	underprivileged	252.53561307805248
13813. ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome	for almost a year	642.5516782517991
13814. his grades had gone steadily downhill and	he had stopped bringing	friends and classmates home from school	2124.286967293042
13815. mr and mrs stewart were puzzled and concerned	167.4453600373709
13816. then one day	dick's classmate jimmy from next door let the cat out of the	bag	1881.7793310495879
13817. the youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed dick bugs	bunny because his teeth protruded	1106.5120381518393
13818. when richard's parents	told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who	specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested	4285.135549296535
13819. during the year that followed dick co-operated whole-heartedly	with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved-	an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his	facial appearance	3441.808982360958
13820. richard stewart is no special case	64.96817330070643
13821. the	majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form	of orthodontic treatment says dr allan g brodie professor	and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of	illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field	4391.7871667655145
13822. what do parents need to know about those years of the braces in	order not to waste a child's time and their money	3471.903577328393
13823. how can they	tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment	373.0551876804014
13824. why and when should	tooth-straightening be undertaken	140.91245424810216
13825. what is it likely to cost	43.197017322841035
13826. occlusion is the dentist's expression	for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed	1889.5854175657648
13827. malocclusion	or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for	787.5633630534692
13828. one main type	of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper	front teeth	1895.247480395309
13829. a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the	face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower	jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type	of malocclusion	3762.5219517737705
13830. these two basic malformations have of course	many variations	393.11945453642704
13831. a child probably requires some form of treatment	if he has any of the following conditions:  a noticeable	protrusion of the upper or lower jaw	2602.5606925431916
13832. crooked overlapping	twisted or widely spaced teeth	141.84313404818025
13833. front teeth not meeting	when the back teeth close	263.6290139044865
13834. upper teeth completely covering	the lowers when the back teeth close	762.3362595156333
13835. the eyeteeth	beginning	to protrude like fangs	94.22505064298973
13836. second teeth that have come in before	the first ones have fallen out making a double row	2125.345276083838
13837. contrary	to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago when all malocclusion was	blamed on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth	irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition	3659.174436738397
13838. however this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must	necessarily resemble those of someone in his family	2812.417882966612
13839. tooth deformity	may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking tongue-thrusting	or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that	there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking	habits	3101.4755309947495
13840. it's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and	no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two	or three years old	4493.5898474753685
13841. occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect	a youngster's teeth; but after that if thumb-sucking pressure	is frequent it will have an effect	2730.237523306981
13842. malocclusion can also	result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long	1650.0616583123215
13843. if a child	loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward	the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent	ones and producing a jumble	3583.19446147868
13844. if baby teeth are retained too long the	incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal	time or may have to erupt in the wrong place	4660.4628805459015
13845. every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by	their malformed teeth	504.2508389278696
13846. some such youngsters rarely smile or they try	to speak with the mouth closed	1406.6143339671823
13847. in certain cases as in dick stewart's	a child's personality is affected	643.3359734448883
13848. yet from the dentist's	point of view bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons	1648.00402570218
13849. bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through	a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots	1874.904462049606
13850. this serious	condition popularly known as pyorrhea is one of the chief causes	of tooth loss in adults	2365.5021961393477
13851. then too misplaced or jammed-together	teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the	likelihood of rapid decay	1576.832308156952
13852. for these and other reasons says dr	brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth	1648.2698727494212
13853. the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal	chewing so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden	on his digestive system	3100.135393687361
13854. because of these chewing troubles a child may	avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition	1874.1974939561028
13855. badly placed	teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping	646.1380351505703
13856. how of straightening	most orthodontic work is done on children	between the ages of 10 and 14 though there have been patients	as young as two and as old as 55 says dr brodie	5517.448145300981
13857. in	the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed	yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed	teeth comparatively easy	3111.2756841399123
13858. orthodontic work is possible because teeth	are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with	an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw; they are not	anchored directly to the bone	5925.935332595642
13859. abnormal pressure applied over a period	of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions	normally in the new position into which it has been guided	3228.099847005516
13860. what	can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's	office	751.0090919135307
13861. on her first visit the orthodontist will take x rays	photographs tooth measurements and tooth prints- an impression	of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws	3237.396962244501
13862. if he decides to proceed he will custom-make for susie an appliance	consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs	3264.767141792569
13863. this	appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure	on the bone	953.2337301759435
13864. as the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side	of it will dissolve and new ones will form on the side from which the	tooth has moved	4507.797297893894
13865. this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue	grows and no faster	1252.8449204548062
13866. if teeth are moved too rapidly serious	injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding	bone holding them in place explains dr brodie	4487.91999113074
13867. moving one	or two teeth can affect the whole system and an ill-conceived plan	of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face	2603.7453346875104
13868. during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately	following each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness	but after a short time this will disappear	4839.556394571375
13869. parents are often	concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay	642.2118560789723
13870. when	in place a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth	that is covered	1885.6373771319527
13871. next susie will enter the treatment stage	and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity	of her condition	2331.261879122454
13872. during these visits the dentist will adjust	the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth	1882.3730327951357
13873. last comes the	retention stage	14.88129349850812
13874. susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable	new position	753.3611065895249
13875. but because teeth sometimes may drift back to	their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in	place	2037.2089641322686
13876. usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and	stretching across the teeth	2113.4825741526765
13877. susie may wear this only at night or for	a few hours during the day	1105.6343008610552
13878. then comes the time when the last	wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive	girl than when she first went to the orthodontist	4478.968550008018
13879. how long	will this take	14.714655520633778
13880. straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may	take only a few months	1410.2125668672
13881. aligning all the teeth may take a year or more	376.66455960155764
13882. an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three	years to correct	1886.9865633673992
13883. the charge for a	complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country	942.2038725189666
13884. work	that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1200	in new york city or chicago	3043.2298968573787
13885. an average national figure for two	to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1000	1252.985235050624
13886. factors	in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill	and education of the practitioner says dr brodie	3475.7413261064803
13887. to	become an orthodontist a man must first be licensed by his state as	a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training	to acquire a license as a specialist	3665.293170414169
13888. costs may seem high	but they used to be even higher says dr brodie	1408.499275899251
13889. fees	are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago	938.6893376605749
13890. the	reason	0.30041514999999996
13891. people today are aware of the value of orthodontics and	as a result there are more practitioners in the field	1890.8562839943265
13892. most	orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic	materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder	of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years	5646.345648906654
13893. in many	cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools	will take patients at a nominal fee	1730.0457060685353
13894. some municipal agencies will	pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents	1180.8761198398283
13895. helps families	growth studies have been carried on consistently	by orthodontists	499.0372002823762
13896. dr brodie has 30-year records of head growth	started 20 minutes after children's births	1404.877761300167
13897. in the	past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was	scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth	formation to a large extent he says	3437.693806289827
13898. fortunately through our	growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that	helps us know what we can do	3476.7448876824174
13899. this knowledge both modifies	and dictates diagnosis and treatment	262.10295563097674
13900. for example a boy may inherit	a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another	2129.7110818198075
13901. in the past	an orthodontist might have tried over four or five years to straighten	and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth	would never accommodate them	3464.2273807087427
13902. now a dentist can recommend extraction	immediately	140.7564474407132
13903. in other cases in view of present-day knowledge	of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five	years before treatment	2024.0233053185798
13904. the child is kept on call and the orthodontist	watches the growth	966.2155858796243
13905. nature often takes care of the problem	says dr brodie	375.03836043394347
13906. a child with a certain type of head and teeth	will outgrow tooth deformity	1424.6102612552372
13907. that is why dr brodie	asks parents not to insist against their dentist's advice that their	child have orthodontic work done too early	2319.136439392166
13908. both because of our	culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions	some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it	is wise to do so	5007.7157656849695
13909. let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start	treatment he urges	640.1653228634528
13910. superior new material for orthodontic	work is another result of research	751.993997203049
13911. plastics are easier to handle	than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money	1412.5231840600477
13912. plaster of paris once utilized in making impressions of teeth has	been replaced by alginates that work quickly	and accurately and with least discomfort to a child	4298.851412272927
13913. best	as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started	the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be	2176.4195213481535
13914. after your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age	of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment	dr brodie advises	4641.803800915217
13915. then see that your youngster	has a routine checkup once a year	646.7306955959845
13916. to help prevent orthodontic	problems from arising your dentist can do these things:	he can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth	3517.889672130555
13917. if	a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay-	and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out	of position become overcrowded and malformed	3360.267899415279
13918. in turn the other teeth	are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them	2114.4181489219263
13919. from time to time the medium mentions other people around him	who were on the other side and reports what they are saying	2315.4056020444013
13920. after	a while there come initials and names and he is interested to hear	some rather unusual family nicknames	2590.0663691303394
13921. as the hour progresses the	sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific	statements	1730.154420850152
13922. there are a few prognoses of coming events	248.29347471773673
13923. another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different	content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing	reading	2189.7799717056378
13924. some mediums speak in practical down-to-earth terms while	others may stress the spiritual	1176.430896146912
13925. not all as a matter of fact consider	themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from	the deceased	1737.8808379530794
13926. in fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to	consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception		on this side of the veil	3270.710813790117
13927. however that may be people are	known to go to mediums for diverse reasons	941.3441267633596
13928. perhaps they are mourning	a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased	or seek indications for future plans	3485.1162917630745
13929. they may of course be curiosity	seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship	1569.3886551922758
13930. the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation	is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated	state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions	instead of talking with a control who speaks through an	entranced sensitive	6820.893771422816
13931. what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary	conversation	796.3182281467483
13932. but it is not really only a conversation	251.84540059575716
13933. many a sitter has been amazed to realize that	the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind	1731.1113145465747
13934. he himself	might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent	unspecified semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she	described it to him! most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability	to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them	7039.857191892212
13935. however in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium	he did not receive a personal reading	1726.0348071971778
13936. instead he brought with	him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium	knew nothing	3061.9738940806724
13937. for this was to be a proxy sitting	166.48698422797733
13938. as	was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of	this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated	from the sensitive	4103.790518972399
13939. dr karlis osis director of research at	the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment	in a tomorrow article		1217.180647869979
13940. he remarked: it has been clearly established	that in a number of instances the message did not come from a	spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter	5019.70248179069
13941. the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's esp	may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central	characters in this drama must be separated	3430.64378587432
13942. one way to do	this is by proxy sittings wherein the person seeking a message	does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute	the proxy sitter	5023.62676180902
13943. if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter	except his name he cannot possibly	give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions	2734.900831196758
13944. all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking	to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal	impressions	4114.60563368536
13945. sometimes in these experiments appointment	sittings are used	168.23956109573464
13946. here the absent sitter makes a date	with a communicator asking him	to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for	him	4330.234136442508
13947. in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator	nothing else	1265.2407567085256
13948. he gives this to the medium at the appointed	time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages	from the communicator	3914.2941217030393
13949. as always a tape recording or detailed	notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter	2040.3069080259872
13950. so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier	between the medium's esp and the absent sitter's mind	3055.146694752261
13951. it	is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though	research still does not know how far afield esp can range	2601.822609036845
13952. now the original absent sitter must decide whether the	statements are meaningful to him	1412.683761171585
13953. here again laboratory approaches	are being evolved for it is recognized how elastic these readings	can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated	in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case	4201.358693589789
13954. it is of course easy to see how j will mean	uncle jack to one person and little jane to another	2034.8994415216898
13955. a journey	a	little white house a change of outlook can apply to many	people	1649.5206327161989
13956. and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform	to one's own point of view which is by nature so personal	2174.35354923459
13957. one sitter	may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed	to him; to another it seems that nobody but his father ever	used the phrase atta boy!   to get around this quite difficult	corner there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the	distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him	7861.3753709378
13958. if he is	not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more	readily assess each item in a larger frame: does that statement	really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life	4366.0403799673795
13959. or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody	and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar	experience	3701.3502165640684
13960. conversely experimenters would consider as impressive	such statements as the following which if they turned out	to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant:   he	had four children two sets of twins	3768.8982399020088
13961. after being a lawyer for twenty-five	years he started studying for the ministry	1184.1553156006019
13962. part of his house	had been moved to the other side of the road	945.6644627240463
13963. he died of typhoid in	1921	65.19981904500966
13964. methods have been developed of assigning weights	to statements; that is it is known empirically that names beginning	with r are more common than those beginning with z; that	fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth; that in the united	states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox	4937.733697723095
13965. so each reading	can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these	weights	2371.8615293694047
13966. specific dates would be important as would double names	261.64796182870873
13967. various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical	probabilities against which to measure the readings	2354.536017112676
13968. in	the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment readings	are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating	sitters trying to throw light on this question of the significance	of mediumistic statements	3657.4580260979747
13969. it is very important indeed in the field	of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis	to know whether the statements are actually only those which any	intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself	6323.73639299036
13970. or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are	in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody	2178.202334273672
13971. that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out	750.0024507655606
13972. so after the sitting has been held several readings at one time	are mailed and the distant sitter	must mark each little item as correct	incorrect doubtful or especially significant		2362.700165539243
13973. he is required to	mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his	2117.669483025197
13974. all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated by adding	up the hits and significants with the weight placed on those in the	sitter's own reading	2873.346956593144
13975. that is if he marks as most correct a reading	not meant for him the total experimental score falls	2593.050057842153
13976. conversely	if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more	accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for	the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material	4049.0269448578483
13977. and there are some positive results though the final findings	will not be known for a long time- and then further research can	be formulated	3907.1993132928537
13978. in another approach to the same procedure the	content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium	is likely to slant her statements	2993.811984225543
13979. does she often speak of locations	of cause of death	554.2053816071142
13980. does she accurately give dates ages kind	of occupation	259.24459400614194
13981. it is possible to find out in which categories most	of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits	3460.719043103864
13982. now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the	items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked	to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the	sensitive is at her best	4233.478073453628
13983. mediumistic impressions are evidently	of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses	1404.2760692527447
13984. i feel cold	the medium says or my leg aches my head is heavy	949.7181179531219
13985. or perhaps she hears words or sounds: there's such a noise	of loud machinery or i hear a child crying or he says	we're all here and glad to see you	5027.046474234876
13986. maybe an entire scene comes	into consciousness with action and motion or a static view: a	house under a pine tree with a little stone path going up to the door	3355.6583709881343
13987. the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively	feels emotions	1182.2633790944917
13988. sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery	and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually	there	2017.231897097843
13989. if pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able	to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost	as if she were physically going closer	5008.660003278301
13990. if asked how she gets	her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them-	some more vividly than others	2182.384943431313
13991. perhaps this is not so extraordinary	after all	249.5042673600367
13992. even in normal experience one gets impressions without	knowing exactly how- of atmosphere of one another's personalities	moods intentions	1722.9096688588609
13993. of course there is an element of training	here: these gifted people by concentration study guidance	have	learned to develop their power	3260.7751130394417
13994. simply using it increases its intensity	i was told by one sensitive	640.0442521339344
13995. nor does a medium automatically	know how to interpret her imagery	746.5611457063113
13996. impressions often appear in	a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value	942.1945419367573
13997. it is apparently	by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium	has to translate these into meaning	3067.741303315839
13998. if communication with an entity	on the other side is taking place this too may assume the form	of clairvoyant symbolism	2042.4536371306974
13999. during one reading an image appeared	of a prisoner in irons	748.0059030154523
14000. but this did not necessarily refer to an	actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state	of mental or spiritual confinement	2728.24614425534
14001. in this connection it is worth	noting how names are sometimes obtained	960.3513168069233
14002. though they are often heard	clairaudiently as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they	are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name	hill for instance	3343.8228602596964
14003. one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line	and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter	2823.6137024357035
14004. the farmer's life must be arranged	to meet the demands of crops and livestock	946.4166591230485
14005. livestock must be	tended every day routinely	140.45687927918942
14006. a slight change in the work schedule may	cut the production of cows or chickens	1102.1219251409977
14007. even if there are no	livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly	during the growing season	2823.372920355982
14008. the worker who lives on a farm	cannot change jobs readily	502.5967327113137
14009. he cannot leave the farm to take work	in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of	capital	3470.854481858285
14010. hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part	of farm life	643.0831457483945
14011. the farmer must get up early and at times work late	at night	1183.7497213944266
14012. frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold	rain	791.1206698262932
14013. no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected	setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up	3061.0280991677055
14014. it may	not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery	that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably	2180.0834617838163
14015. production	may fall far below expectations	64.81612344138132
14016. drought hail disease and insects	take their toll of crops	374.2470206970473
14017. sickness or loss of some of the livestock	may cut into the owner's earnings even into his capital	2362.511358032877
14018. returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good	year	941.7141381859598
14019. the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult	to farm profitably on a part-time basis	2356.8330830342034
14020. land within commuting	distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has	subdivision possibilities	1729.2197736590522
14021. part-time farmers generally must pay higher	prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller	quantities	2331.8787847698245
14022. if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high	farm labor costs will also be high	1732.7894332579647
14023. a part-time farmer needs	unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre	as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer	4297.074805597006
14024. it will frequently	be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment	791.8363035479628
14025. he	may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations	such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his	turn	4088.476188632004
14026. there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he	is away at his off-farm job	1408.4651374668174
14027. the farm may be an additional	burden if the main job is lost	1183.5913536575727
14028. this may be true whether the farm is	owned or rented	505.4416411710854
14029. if the farm is rented the rent must be paid	561.1937994627563
14030. if it is owned taxes must be paid and if the place is not free	of mortgage there will be interest and	payments on the principal to take care of	3224.8278676275168
14031. a	farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children	564.8398086002611
14032. it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air	502.61404408702094
14033. the children can	do chores adapted to their age and ability	758.5627610001413
14034. caring for a calf a pig	or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for	work	1580.976932333955
14035. part-time farming gives a measure of security if the	regular job is lost provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes	enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs	5348.711175268587
14036. for some retired persons part-time farming is a good way	to supplement retirement income	941.5891351952394
14037. it is particularly suitable for those	who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health	2344.694080273878
14038. generally the s	ame level of living costs less in the country than	in the city	1249.6649227819348
14039. the savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed	752.6806572170098
14040. usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on	the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more	2310.5460966760684
14041. where schools fire and police protection and similar municipal services	are of equal quality in city and country real estate taxes are	usually about the same	4084.964178063915
14042. a part-time farmer and his family can	use their spare time profitably	640.4434079876784
14043. some persons consider the	work on a farm recreational	396.98653270964655
14044. for some white-collar workers it is a	welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner	1421.0050295741314
14045. labor and equipment needed	part-time farming can take comparatively	little land labor and equipment- or a great deal	2364.9992407479913
14046. it depends	on the kind and the scale of the farming operation	644.1038413028748
14047. general	requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below	560.0790873098448
14048. specific	requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed	on pages 8 to 14	1247.9195313355938
14049. three quarters to 1 acre of good land	is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a	small flock of chickens a cow and two pigs	4812.273082424377
14050. you could not of course	raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small	1103.3738594806885
14051. if you	want to	raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale you'll	need more land	2600.776296083239
14052. in deciding how much land you want take into	account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect	2026.8906789164344
14053. but	consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your	other work	2124.5384627425947
14054. the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in	value may influence your decision	1096.8454222915586
14055. some part-time farmers buy more	land than they need in anticipation of suburban development	1405.9200511200324
14056. this is	a highly speculative venture	43.7865963972697
14057. sometimes a desired acreage is offered	only as part of a larger tract	1188.281800428114
14058. when surplus land is not expensive	to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy	so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might	impair the residential value of the farm	4198.983490974967
14059. if you have a	year-round full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your	family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of	the work or you hire help	5650.372317418713
14060. as a rule part-time farmers hire little	help	165.88320566073975
14061. in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor	compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with	the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1	5456.796783778072
14062. list	the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month	944.6824256420357
14063. you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have	one	1416.0507453092478
14064. do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare	time- only what you are willing to use for farm work	2323.2928753881274
14065. if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only	hand tools	1881.5501387821373
14066. you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing	however	638.1327468777184
14067. for larger plantings you'll need some kind of power	for plowing harrowing disking and cultivating	1641.7147372372542
14068. if you have a planting	of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor		1216.3168415567047
14069. these	tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier	soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing	3674.277266299615
14070. cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the	small-scale farmer	945.2551321410558
14071. if you are going to farm for extra cash income on	a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments	when you choose among farm enterprises	4680.435454555167
14072. you can keep your	machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing	the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring	someone with machinery to do certain jobs	3564.099433493415
14073. if an expensive and specialized	piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig a combine	or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work	5371.596823589366
14074. before you look for a farm you'll need	to know the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and	whether you want to buy or rent	2984.3929400440006
14075. information on pages 8 to 14	may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture	2810.775865755337
14076. if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish	to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like	and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent	a place for a year or two before you buy	5038.533494934256
14077. discussed below are	some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm	2138.281911196874
14078. choose a location within easy	commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities	1259.662769546089
14079. then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell	the farm	1181.4125166781575
14080. the presence of alternative job opportunities also will	make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable	1727.6195752252054
14081. nearness to	if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby	1184.2117631586984
14082. if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example	you should be close to a town or city	2037.5693469461573
14083. look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes	560.6741387504849
14084. there are slums	in the country as well as in the city	643.102130638332
14085. few rural areas are protected	by zoning	140.23526536551554
14086. a tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant	or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to	hurt its value	2734.7681979550352
14087. check on the schools	in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation	to and from them	2817.168669497315
14088. find out whether fire protection sewage	system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the	locality	1567.4630972546606
14089. if these facilities are not at the door getting them may	cost more than you expect	1876.883682812842
14090. you may have to provide them yourself or	get along without them	639.6141606262097
14091. you cannot get along without an adequate	supply of pure water	754.0764831632665
14092. if you are considering a part-time farm where	the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well	on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled	3774.46824164618
14093. a pond may	provide adequate water for livestock and garden	565.893103900262
14094. pond water can be filtered	for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go	to so much trouble	2020.5084540952853
14095. the following amounts of water are needed per day	for livestock and domestic uses	1417.0323349649157
14096. is the land	suited to the crops you intend to raise	502.9076659449652
14097. if you can't tell get	help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist	1644.5711947286607
14098. soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between	good crops and poor ones	1416.5801593574
14099. small areas that aren't right for a certain	the	will the house on any part-time farm you are considering	make a satisfactory full-time residence	3715.6919993424117
14100. how much will it cost to	do any necessary modernizing and redecorating	638.5738843154561
14101. if the house is not	wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating	system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements	4489.300499627346
14102. the value of the farm to you will depend	on-  the value of	the products you can raise on it	1895.1455583728293
14103. the possibilities of selling	the property later on for suburban subdivision	754.2201310671123
14104. decide first	what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison	with what it would cost to live in town	2735.486828372875
14105. take into account the difference	in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and	the cost of travel to work	3055.3257624679827
14106. next estimate the value of possible	earnings of the farm	372.47620210914835
14107. to do this set up a plan on paper for operating	the farm	1192.5155999199064
14108. list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be	expected to produce in an average year	1570.354564014839
14109. estimate the value of the produce	at normal prices	392.88418557384915
14110. the total is the probable gross income from farming	263.29388727192486
14111. to find estimated net farm income subtract estimated	annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming	2128.0188058932063
14112. include	as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings	and equipment	641.2507690833755
14113. also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be	contributed by the family	1890.0187216735462
14114. it may be hard to decide what this labor	is worth but charge something for it	1243.5287891799935
14115. otherwise you may pay too much	for the farm and get nothing for your labor	1640.5760878499918
14116. to figure the	value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated	annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get	in interest if the money were invested in some other way	4128.67189747562
14117. everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his	day in court as in some vast collective dirge	3491.575680956213
14118. for almost two months	the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the	grave about fathers and mothers graybeards adolescents babies starved	beaten to death strangled machine-gunned gassed burned	3353.074907734499
14119. one	who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected	by height for the gas chambers	3274.3188764415927
14120. the gruesome humor of the nazis	was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name	of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david- nor	the gratuitous sadism of ss officers	4041.8559104053775
14121. public relations strategists	everywhere watching the reaction of the german press the liberal	press the lunatic-fringe press listening to their neighbors studying	interviews with men and women on the street cried out: too much	too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled the horrors	are losing their effect	7457.736068320666
14122. and still another witness one who had crawled	out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had	been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before	being shot	4136.153334649551
14123. h   most of this testimony may have been legally	admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi	crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it	of the defendant's department of jewish affairs	6412.968762787558
14124. counsel for the	defense however shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current	of dreadful recollections rarely raised an objection	2009.6678503422547
14125. would not the	emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming	if not exhausting effect likely to improve his client's chances	3672.09977946094
14126. those who feared emotionalism at the trial showed less	understanding than dr servatius of the route by which man achieves	the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies	2856.8154590798176
14127. interruptions	came	largely from the bench which numerous times rebuked the attorney	general for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious	effort to choke off the flow	5016.722725491428
14128. but there was a contrast even	more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem	and those in moscow and new york	2602.696558260625
14129. in each of the last the trial	marked the beginning of a new course: in moscow the liquidation	of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin's dictatorship;	in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism	with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard	6811.869943096001
14130. these trials were	properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was	a political act producing political consequences	1724.1950201632285
14131. but what could the	eichmann trial initiate	140.29184447684764
14132. of what new course could it mark the beginning	262.5325806602287
14133. the eichmann case looked to the past not to the future	753.3498503348756
14134. it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection	and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there	are jews	2973.5104791003014
14135. as such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification	by a message	1642.4267944367105
14136. it is not an individual	that is in the dock at this historical trial- said ben gurion	and not the nazi regime alone- but anti-semitism throughout	history	2856.6074633840594
14137. how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to	maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews	without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism	5160.8228725791805
14138. and if it was not an individual who was in the dock why	was the trial as we shall observe later all but scuttled in the	attempt to prove eichmann a fiend	3439.0342044271856
14139. these questions touch the	root of confusion in the prosecution's case	752.3401767444415
14140. it might be contended	of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic	feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism	2311.8790119350174
14141. but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined	by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment	3680.179723900442
14142. in such a case	the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied	to the issue by argument	2320.271694336824
14143. one who could be linked to anti-semitism	only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the	jew-baiter throughout the ages	3479.4039567452432
14144. shout at eichmann though he might	the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying	the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally	recognized category of anti-semitism	3849.122167672779
14145. yes he believed that the	jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course	typical of patriotic anti-semites; but he believed in the	jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member	of a cult speculating on the nature of things	7119.249492891399
14146. the real question was	how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer	to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself	2969.680995326842
14147. in	regard to eichmann	it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained	a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism a	principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent	5927.241527676324
14148. perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could	as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the	jews and still be their murderer	2464.762283136513
14149. not through fear of disobeying orders	as eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar giddiness	that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained	in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler's	victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical	rightness that was able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous	the better well let's try it	8738.8682074878
14150. at any rate the substance	of eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from	his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor	did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success	on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to	that extent	5064.058300233305
14151. but if the trial did not expose the special	nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened	to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary	anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany	and wherever else they could find it	7687.110247063424
14152. if anti-semitism was on trial	in jerusalem why was it not identified and with enough emphasis	to capture the notice of the world press in its connection with the	activities of eichmann's department of jewish affairs as exemplified	by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites	in germany as well as in poland czechoslovakia hungary	5448.26944356078
14153. the measures for annihilation	proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation	civilian agencies of government	1419.4884632823396
14154. heydrich in opening the conference	followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order	issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as	a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the jews	from german living space through violence economic strangulation	forced emigration and evacuation	7076.332577576737
14155. in other words the promulgators	of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews	was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating	in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on	the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective as	a readiness for murder	5152.929462506067
14156. this in fact it turned out to be	248.33131425331084
14157. since	the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible once the wheels had	began to turn persons controlling german industries social institutions	and armed forces became through their anti-semitism or their	tolerance of it conscious accomplices of hitler's crimes; whether	in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually	5262.164720144139
14158. what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn	the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the	exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp	brute	5004.437010453999
14159. not in eichmann's anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism	of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning	of the trial	2177.560158120745
14160. no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had	conceived their anti-semitism as an innocent dislike of jews	as do others like them today	4107.243281866324
14161. the final solution proved that the	jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the	criminality and madness of others	2174.648728000063
14162. ought not an edifying trial have	made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how	representative types of mere anti-semites were drawn step by	step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings	5779.859988066475
14163. the prosecutor	in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-semitism	among the germans which hitler stimulated and transformed	2035.1017857190614
14164. but	if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann's	head	at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned the press	seems to have missed it	4656.726903931994
14165. nor did the trial devote much	attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis	both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations	and states	3324.349994309752
14166. certainly one of the best ways of warning the	world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous	weapon	3066.1562925114317
14167. eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew	can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society	into a menace to all his neighbors	3215.3245535488104
14168. do patriots everywhere know	enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in	the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations splitting	apart individuals and groups arousing the meanest and most dishonest	impulses pulverizing trust and personal dignity and finally	forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them	partners in unspeakable crimes	8257.132961473344
14169. the career of eichmann made the trial	a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization: fearful	of being mistaken for a jew he seeks protection in his nazi uniform;	clinging to the enemy-jew idea he is forced to overcome habits of	politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent	to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania	and envy of those above him	5831.750535528576
14170. is this the type of citizen you	desire	251.90257205963456
14171. the trial should have asked the nations	94.0397256673936
14172. but though this	characterization in no way diminished eichmann's guilt the prosecutor	more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a	political one would have none of it	5009.275702117019
14173. finally if the mission	of the trial was to convict anti-semitism how could it have failed	to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which	the final solution was aided by native jew-haters- ie	germany poland hungary czechoslovakia- and those in which it	met the obstacle of human solidarity- denmark holland italy bulgaria	france	5402.106187796378
14174. should not everyone have been awakened to it as an	outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism	proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose	citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports	6424.557873487615
14175. wasn't	this meaning of eichmann's experience in various countries	worth highlighting	496.1197238559412
14176. as the first collective confrontation	of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represents a recovery	of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen	years and which is still by no means complete		4965.855139370085
14177. only across a distance	of time could the epic accounting begin	504.9282696223295
14178. it is already difficult to	recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to	the jews of europe	3454.3845192891686
14179. it is not that the facts of the persecution were	unavailable; most of the information elicited in jerusalem had	been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and	investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors'	accounts	4209.365499024713
14180. in poughkeepsie n y in 1952 a roman catholic hospital	presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the	planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff	4870.734164104239
14181. three agreed but four declined and were suspended	166.3079224646362
14182. after a flood of	protests they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953	1173.4468541758356
14183. the peace	of the community	was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the	incident felt uneasy	1725.3784226483629
14184. in new york city in 1958 the city's	commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide	a protestant mother with a contraceptive device	3921.3139054518397
14185. he thereby precipitated	a bitter controversy involving protestants jews and roman	catholics that continued for two months until the city's board	of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy	3115.0685625351966
14186. a year	later in albany n y a roman catholic hospital barred an	orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood	association	3706.0792471165196
14187. immediately the religious groups of the city were	embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's	right to freedom of religious belief and conscience	2984.902664561049
14188. these incidents	typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no	controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension	rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control	issue	5639.158491145287
14189. it has flared up periodically on the front pages of	newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in	municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies	2605.6730836417278
14190. it has erupted	on the national level in the matter of including birth-control	information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries	3261.278360581226
14191. where	it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment	like a volcano ready to explode at any moment	2167.0800614821037
14192. the	time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove	this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life	of our nation	4821.3101507267265
14193. the first step toward the goal is the establishment	of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication	on other than the polemical level	2740.858408544378
14194. instead of emotional recrimination	loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study	of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more	serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is	reached	6202.7824544606165
14195. all too frequently points out james o'gara	managing editor of commonweal catholics run roughshod over	protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the	reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their	jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed	in recent decades	4882.447786353123
14196. all too often our language is unduly	harsh	250.26913760077156
14197. the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-	frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-	already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the	over-all objectives of family planning	3220.536161618391
14198. instead of catholics' being	obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number	of offspring as many non-catholics imagine the ideal of responsible	parenthood is stressed	4318.860007227376
14199. family planning is encouraged so that parents	will be able to provide properly for their offspring	1253.0613678849872
14200. pope	pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from	the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the	whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as	those often mentioned in the so-called medical eugenic economic and	social indications	7526.785107390136
14201. this means that such factors as the health	of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their	children with the necessities of life the degree of population density	of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately	be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring	5012.793367411183
14202. these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics	in family planning	958.7664647288536
14203. the laws of many states permit birth control	only for medical reasons	639.238078674746
14204. the roman catholic church however	sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning	1413.543793134782
14205. catholics	protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of	family planning but disagree over the methods to be used	2023.936456411712
14206. the roman	catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also	known as the use of the infertile or safe period	3293.066413872924
14207. the church considers	this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author:	it involves no frustration of nature's laws but simply an intelligent	and disciplined use of them	3324.2750887537527
14208. with the exception of the roman	catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no	moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives	allowing the couple free choice	4843.352429606569
14209. here is a difference in	theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement	932.5518882128454
14210. the	grounds for the church's position are scriptural	the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the	unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest	ecclesiastical authority and the natural law	5807.452105810071
14211. the latter plays a prominent	role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive	entirely apart from scripture in determining the ethical character of	birth-prevention methods	2735.5297052675764
14212. the roman catholic natural-law tradition	regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of	the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual	love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end	5811.160530428678
14213. this conclusion	is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason	can ascertain god's purpose in the universe and that god makes known	his purpose by certain given physical arrangements	3646.638701935373
14214. thus	man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal	act is procreation the propagation of the race	3053.7835370591874
14215. moreover man	may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by	god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for	the control of conception	3119.259083191606
14216. believing that god is the author of this	law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are	obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them	4985.368145995828
14217. let	it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between	protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable	2018.4793988025176
14218. but	people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without	taking up arms against those who disagree with them	3017.8310365305806
14219. why is it	so different in regard to birth control	372.8360558545645
14220. it is because each side has	sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation	and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical	consequences thereof upon others	4851.380749887773
14221. it is always a temptation	for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant	one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint	upon others	3105.4764596400237
14222. both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed	to this temptation in the past	1176.5148773063713
14223. consider what happened during	world war 1 when the protestant churches united to push the	prohibition law through congress	1729.5222801933348
14224. many of them sincerely believe	that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically	evil and sinful	3266.837901770733
14225. with over four million american men away at war protestants	forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general	public	1727.082714945204
14226. with the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that	the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens	3239.1571785682595
14227. the attempt	to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers	hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled	in our history	2831.5668357416716
14228. the so-called noble experiment came to an	inglorious end	392.5900431623034
14229. that tumultuous painful and costly experience	shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced	when it has little correspondence with the general view of society	3118.4753786547167
14230. that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control	today	1404.8527730966362
14231. up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned	by all christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary	to divine law	2173.9393104710284
14232. this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian	countries	749.7346228858663
14233. today the roman catholic and orthodox churches	stand virtually alone in holding that conviction	933.3879614282245
14234. the various lambeth	conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual	change that has taken place among protestants generally	2604.9949027491593
14235. in 1920 the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception	and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural	means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers-	physical moral and religious- thereby incurred and against	the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race	5015.136583871253
14236. denouncing	the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference	declared: we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded	as the governing considerations of christian marriage	4837.76733108056
14237. one is the	primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance	of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is	the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful	self-control	3854.4791063968996
14238. the conference called for a vigorous campaign against	the open or secret sale of contraceptives	1651.6163954500432
14239. in 1930 the lambeth	conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be	the procreation of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances	contraception might be morally legitimate	3214.475248614067
14240. in 1958	the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by	god on parents everywhere	1888.1344591357822
14241. many other protestant denominations	preceded the anglicans in such action	376.0206250001414
14242. in march 1931 22 out	of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified	artificial methods of birth control	3463.9691919295437
14243. as to the necessity	the committee declared for some form of effective control of the	size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control	of conception there can be no question h	3853.2034441342175
14244. there is general agreement	also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression	of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right	3683.1786766615173
14245. since then many protestant denominations have made separate	pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared	it at times to be a religious duty	2844.5633485329417
14246. what determines the morality	they state is not the means used but the motive	1419.9162142179796
14247. in	general the means that prove most effective are	considered the most ethical	789.9862902924981
14248. this development is reflected in	the action taken in february 1961 by the general board of the	national	council of churches the largest protestant organization in the	us	4472.223622926757
14249. the board approved and commended the use of birth-control	devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning	1725.8313213811264
14250. it	called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting	the information or availability of contraceptives	1883.8073890236028
14251. the general	board declared: most of the protestant churches hold contraception	and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are	right h	2466.609292813412
14252. the general protestant conviction is that motives rather	than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are	limited to the prevention of conception	3903.054492313839
14253. an action once universally	condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil	law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant	denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive	religious duty	4135.952846642785
14254. this viewpoint has now been translated into	action by the majority of people in this country	1886.0800591572356
14255. repeated polls have	disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the	practice of birth control	1571.6370535331575
14256. for all concerned with social-welfare	legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary	change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american	people is clear profound and far-reaching	5167.602296357387
14257. to try to oppose the general	religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative	fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was	occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment	3942.836010764762
14258. this brings	us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in	the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion:	they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief	6051.337016869198
14259. conscience and religion are concerned with private sin: the civil	law is concerned with public crimes	1268.0882810864161
14260. only confusion failure	and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority	the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the	possibility of sin	4839.1035727413955
14261. among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived	imposition would be religion itself	789.69003874471
14262. on april 17 1610 the sturdy little three-masted bark discovery	weighed anchor in st katherine's pool london and	floated down the thames toward the sea	3902.337991872976
14263. she carried besides her captain	a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration	of the arctic waters of north america	2313.3532641649035
14264. seventeen months later	on september 6 1611 an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery	limping eastward outside galway bay	2605.2111843642697
14265. when she reached port	she was found to have on board only eight men all near starvation	1417.5701907588473
14266. the	captain was gone and the mate was gone	389.92771514205907
14267. the man who now commanded	her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman	946.9258368906494
14268. what disaster	struck the discovery during those seventeen months	389.32195888132594
14269. what happened	to the fourteen missing men	94.41908559676368
14270. these questions have remained	one of the great sea mysteries of all time	1177.1441422641017
14271. for hundreds of years the	evidence available consisted of the captain's fragmentary journal	a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors a note	found in a dead man's desk on board and several second-hand	reports	3858.219918509225
14272. all told they offered a highly confused picture	252.56933535072676
14273. but	since 1927 researchers digging into ancient court records and legal	files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information	2022.3909614196061
14274. not	enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate	picture of the events of the voyage	3254.4865335611203
14275. historians have had	two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations	641.5692177935439
14276. first	they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma	395.68437988830254
14277. second they believed	it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose	name is permanently stamped on our maps on american towns and counties	on a great american river and on half a million square miles	of arctic seas	4394.400501499375
14278. this	is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able- or	ever probably will be able- to determine:   the sailing in	the spring of 1610 was hudson's fourth in four years	5773.262507609432
14279. each time	his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from western	europe to the far east	1735.3132180693403
14280. in 1607 and 1608 the english muscovy	company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole	or across the top of russia	4284.488083950311
14281. twice he had failed and the muscovy	company indicated it would not back him again	1096.8550578641411
14282. in 1609 the	dutch east india company hired hudson gave him two learned geographers	fitted him out with a ship called the half moon and supplied	him with dutch sailors	4833.971294166542
14283. this time he turned westward to the	middle atlantic coast of north america	791.8220192329785
14284. his chief discovery was important-	the great north river- but it produced	no northwest passage	1634.038739474941
14285. when the half moon put in at	dartmouth england in the fall of 1609 word of hudson's findings	leaked out and english interest in him revived	2720.232063103142
14286. the government	forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship	746.9211727258289
14287. he thereupon went	to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth	941.0807671127592
14288. by springtime	he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage	of henry prince of wales	2349.15776874435
14289. he had obtained and provisioned a veteran	ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one	the largest he had ever commanded	2464.437456592541
14290. the purpose of this	fourth voyage was clear	248.85030149707342
14291. a century of exploration had established that	a great land mass north and south america lay between europe	and	the indies	2040.8905082304416
14292. one by one the openings in the coast that promised a	passage through had been explored and discarded	2364.3503321913963
14293. in fact hudson's	sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes	1415.760290300525
14294. but there remained one mysterious unexplored gap far to	the north	752.2397555502406
14295. nearly twenty-five years before captain john davis had	noted as he sailed near the arctic circle a very great gulf the	water whirling and roaring as it were the meeting of tides	3464.8220078376207
14296. he	named this opening between baffin island and labrador the furious	overfall	963.4371425510257
14297. in 1602 george waymouth in the same little discovery that	hudson now commanded had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his	frightened men turned the ship back	2989.1566483171473
14298. hudson now proposed to sail all	the	way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway	2358.723041100483
14299. even hudson experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he	was must have had qualms as he slid down the thames	2038.096372353331
14300. ahead were perilous	ice-filled waters	22.43865982371079
14301. on previous voyages it had been in precisely	such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain	1884.424231416258
14302. on the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of	novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that	he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case	6077.231388551211
14303. on	the third voyage a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch	and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him	to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic	3548.2431288247667
14304. worse	his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before	1179.7829635470969
14305. of	only one could he be sure- young john hudson his second son	790.4641362646142
14306. the	mate robert juet who had kept the journal on the half moon	was experienced- but he was a bitter old man ready to complain or	desert at any opportunity	4814.126065793385
14307. philip staffe the ship's carpenter was	a good worker but perversely independent	636.7247966802863
14308. arnold lodley and michael	perse were like the rest- lukewarm ready to swing against hudson	in a crisis	2366.3386860700657
14309. but men willing to sail at all into waters where	wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find	2024.4237590768134
14310. hudson	knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer	1652.6406572519013
14311. and	he refused to be anything else	93.32781861451221
14312. it is believed that hudson	was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was	trained	on company ships	3033.771603974155
14313. he was a londoner married with three sons	166.38858934768368
14314. in 1610	hudson was probably in his early forties a good navigator a stubborn	voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession	3479.0188063735486
14315. hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a	few miles down the thames	1104.1001646655573
14316. there at the river's edge waited one henry	greene whom hudson listed as a clerk	1664.6018301143354
14317. greene was in actuality	a young ruffian from kent who had broken with his parents in	order to keep the company he preferred- pimps panders and whores	2867.1448082544293
14318. he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board	and he had greene wait at gravesend where the discovery picked	him up	4502.815753384106
14319. for the first three weeks the ship skirted up the	east coast of great britain then turned westward	1571.5744299938447
14320. on may 11 she	reached iceland	64.93773979012352
14321. poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the	crew called lousie bay	1099.5317293960165
14322. the subsequent two-weeks wait made the	crew quarrelsome	251.177927310706
14323. with hudson looking on his protege greene picked	a fight with the ship's surgeon edward wilson	1258.0460061277993
14324. the issue was	settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining ashore determined	to catch the next fishing boat back to england	3275.315267346
14325. with difficulty	hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship and they sailed from iceland	944.0562182747066
14326. early in june the discovery passed desolation	and in mid-june entered the furious overfall	1405.7015066746455
14327. floating ice bore down from the north and west	263.7222469930208
14328. fog hung	over the route constantly	65.38042549721771
14329. turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet	167.70766029818049
14330. the ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic	north pole	1405.8368725208834
14331. as the bergs grew larger hudson was	forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay an inlet of the	great strait	2322.016096426843
14332. after finding that its coasts led nowhere however he	turned north again toward the main ice-filled passageway- and the	crew at first uneasy then frightened rebelled	4104.708741080699
14333. the trouble	was at least partly juet's doing	168.4313059420362
14334. for weeks he had been saying that	hudson's idea of sailing through to java was absurd	1869.3846050368088
14335. the great	crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice	of pure reason	1425.7794950649436
14336. a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would	sail no farther	1185.7962751733573
14337. instead of quelling the dissension as many	captains of the era would have done	hudson decided to be reasonable	1747.201985125909
14338. he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which	he set up in view of the crew	2810.8832001849773
14339. patiently he explained what he knew	about their course and their objectives	642.6357944875429
14340. when hudson had finished	the town meeting broke down into a general wordy	argument	1423.8003079384346
14341. one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety	of them to be back in england	2035.625031342221
14342. up spoke carpenter staffe who	said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home	1406.6514039673211
14343. the meeting broke up	2.9487302515177216
14344. hudson was free to sail on	65.28459020622059
14345. all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long	strait avoiding ice and rocky islands	1416.1634865843378
14346. on august 3 two massive	headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before	so far as hudson knew seen by europeans	3482.516928276937
14347. to starboard was a cape	a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands	of screaming sea birds	2038.2640451307009
14348. to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind	to a precipice of 2000 feet	1873.3732660448466
14349. hudson named the capes digges and	wolstenholme for two of his backers	639.0550440316849
14350. hudson pointed the discovery	down the east coast of the newly discovered sea	confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the	pacific	4077.5178965774803
14351. after three weeks' swift sailing however the ship entered	an area of shallow marshes and river deltas	1406.4068133772928
14352. the	great sea to the westwards was a dead end	563.4475029905268
14353. this must have	been hudson's blackest discovery	93.45049429947676
14354. for he seemed to sense at once	that before him was no south sea but the solid bulk of the north	american continent	3461.4819505337014
14355. this was the bitter end and hudson seemed to	know he was destined to failure	1099.7866738910436
14356. feverishly he tried to brush	away this intuition	248.137974773013
14357. north and south east and west back and forth	he sailed in the land-locked bay plowing furiously forward until land	appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after	week	3564.572855120846
14358. hundreds of miles to the north the route back to england	through the furious overfall was again filling with ice	2812.02660397452
14359. the men were at first puzzled then angered by the aimless tacking	641.4193188519625
14360. once more juet's complaints were the loudest	140.88240363566467
14361. hudson's reply	was to accuse the mate of disloyalty	261.59066744583026
14362. juet demanded that hudson prove	his charges in an open trial	755.9171615905134
14363. the trial was held september	10	43.65395893548869
14364. hudson presiding heard juet's defense then called for testimony	from crew members	961.0274561429502
14365. juet had made plentiful enemies several men	stepped forward	261.98673596848494
14366. hands on bible seaman lodley and carpenter staffe	swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords	in their cabins	3689.6774423827983
14367. cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted	bloodshed on the ship	501.13285110226934
14368. others added that juet had wanted to turn the	ship homeward	750.5030789792913
14369. hudson deposed juet and cut his pay	93.4596335057152
14370. the new	mate was robert bylot talented but inexperienced	391.0941948049955
14371. there were other	shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves	1099.889361140538
14372. the important result however was that juet and francis	clemens the deposed boatswain became hudson's sworn enemies	2104.291778852177
14373. as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little	bay every incident lessened the crew's respect for him	1576.7303540753257
14374. once	after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather hudson ordered	the anchor raised before the sea had calmed	3037.6321715427594
14375. just as it was being	hauled inboard a sea hit the ship	642.0918848452941
14376. michael butt and adame moore	were thrown off the capstan and badly injured	1187.8508584372062
14377. the anchor cable would	have been lost overboard but philip staffe was on hand to sever	it with his axe	1861.7782188462766
14378. thomas douglas fifth earl of selkirk a noble humanitarian	scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands	conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river	of the north	5916.798413659545
14379. since the land he desired lay within the great northern	empire of the hudson's bay company he purchased great blocks of	the comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies	3340.47502149418
14380. having	achieved this end he was able to buy 116000 square miles in the	valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers	3043.9788682783865
14381. the grant which stretched	southward to lake traverse- the headwaters of the red- was	made in may 1811 and by october of that year a small group of scots	was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay	4212.0163926297155
14382. thus	at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify	the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle	of tippecanoe anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the	center of the north american continent to the west of the american	agricultural frontier	7245.157642801129
14383. seven hundred miles south of york factory	at the forks of the red and the assiniboine twenty-three	men located a settlement in august 1812	2463.877919633448
14384. by october the little	colony about fort douglas numbered 100	560.188929874807
14385. within	a few years the scots engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring	the rich soil of the valley were joined by a group called meurons	2863.6595272064087
14386. the latter members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported	by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the	war of 1812 had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of	the war in 1815	6054.252953670929
14387. selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go	to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect	his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the	intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire	4309.024436062563
14388. the mercenaries	were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of	the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as	1818	4828.282679073405
14389. it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages	of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement	southward	2587.7174016610825
14390. when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was	assessed all but fifty of the scots swiss and metis moved up	the red to the mouth of the pembina river	5311.253522901782
14391. here they built huts and	a stockade named fort daer after selkirk's barony in scotland	1107.6224665302748
14392. the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer	to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for	food	4081.784269189925
14393. the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move	southward by british fur traders	945.0860848923869
14394. for many years the northwest company	had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi	river some 300 miles southeast of present-day st paul	minnesota	4272.139781741489
14395. when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm	out of the united states its british-born employees now become american	citizens- joseph rolette joseph renville and alexis bailly-	continued in the fur business	3756.651006896208
14396. on big stone lake near the	headwaters of the red river robert dickson superintendent of	the western indian department of canada had a trading post and planned	in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small	artillery pieces	6804.992254031543
14397. his trading goods came from canada to the forks	of red river and from selkirk's settlement he brought them south	in carts	2185.924588530262
14398. these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days	of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk	colony was begun	4112.526449551256
14399. in 1802 henry referred to our new carts as	being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as	a horse could pack	2871.957382813253
14400. they were held together by pegs and withes and	in later times drawn by a single ox in thills	2581.3978087922114
14401. it was dickson	who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast	by way of the united states	2018.4662968723646
14402. in september 1817 at fort daer	dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of sioux	he escorted to prairie du chien	4083.0719737892773
14403. during the trip selkirk decided	that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern	united states was the best route for goods from england to reach	red river and that the united states was a better source of supply	for many goods than either canada or england	4912.653246314141
14404. upon arriving at	baltimore selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams	secretary of state at washington inquiring about laws covering trade	with missouri and illinois territories	4481.700300488853
14405. this traffic he	declared prophetically tho' it might be of small account at first	would increase with the progress of our settlements h	2308.9816986861606
14406. the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop	into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might	have expected	4298.885613562638
14407. in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the	forks and in december 1819 twenty men left fort	daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien	3090.61544426628
14408. it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three	months of labor on mackinac boats	2570.299701637849
14409. with these completed and ice	gone from the st peter's river	their 250 bushels of wheat 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels	of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats	and rowed up the river to big stone lake across into lake traverse	and down the red	5158.190934527863
14410. they reached fort douglas in june 1820	141.05354818421662
14411. this	epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk 1040	642.1143586860659
14412. nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were	forced to retreat to fort daer for food	2798.4826345956258
14413. thereafter seed and food became	more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round	1421.4877842741148
14414. activity by british traders and the presence of a colony	on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send	lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post	300 miles northwest of prairie du chien until then the most advanced	united states post	7121.6518526946575
14415. in september 1822 two companies of infantry	arrived at the mouth of the st peter's river the head of navigation	on the mississippi and began construction of fort st	anthony which upon completion was renamed in honor of its commander	colonel josiah snelling	4462.740439800664
14416. it was from the american outposts	that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good	2104.7404128955895
14417. hercules	l dousman fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien contracted	to supply selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle and	alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers	3439.352004279181
14418. bailly	after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 was forced to leave	some of the cattle at the hudson's bay company's post on lake	traverse in the sieux country and reached fort garry as the	selkirk hudson's bay company center was now called late in the	fall	7141.8278218356645
14419. he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families	of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward	the united states	2463.4680051408186
14420. observing their distressing condition colonel	snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military	reservation	1895.5437697273342
14421. as these swiss were moving from the selkirk	settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota dousman	of michilimackinac michigan and prairie du chien was traveling	to red river to open a trade in merchandise	3841.377904031576
14422. early in 1822 he was	at fort garry offering to bring in pork flour liquor and tobacco	2118.721782232057

14440. the resultant town platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father	galtier's mission st paul was to become an important center	of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers	who remained at red river	6666.139282673712
14441. while population at fort	garry increased rapidly from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 economic	opportunities did not increase at a similar rate	2450.8865003070705

14488. in the south after the first year of	the war paper and ink were very poor	1885.3168174599355

14538. the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion	to the popularity of nationalism in america	2109.3446486903567
14539. and the emphasis on nationalism	in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence	across the world	1723.4000081464994
14540. thus if we are to observe american folklore	in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships	between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset	4456.550788762307
14541. historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism	every age rewrites the events	of its history in terms of what should have been creating legends	about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary	actions	3942.420036932895
14542. what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important	as a country	superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches	its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness	4993.372191634851
14543. its folklore	and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account	for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to	become a cohesive force for national identification	3451.212597707271
14544. one can apply	these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries	as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be	applied again to the united states in more recent years	5947.789928118479
14545. the popularity	of local color literature before the spanish-american war the	steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the	frontier west in our mass media are cases in point	3432.071119385079
14546. nor is it an accident	that baseball growing into the national game in the last 75 years	has become a microcosm of american life that learned societies such	as the american folklore society and the american historical	association were founded in the 1880s or that courses in american literature	american civilization american anything have swept our school	and college curricula	8273.356907793084
14547. of course nationalism has really	outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours and its	continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the	twentieth-century	united states	3349.9172088878463
14548. yet nationalism has lost few of its	charms for the historian writer or man in the street	2113.6708368075947
14549. it is an understandable	paradox that most american history and most american literature	is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic	point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion	over palm and pine	4051.7852407639534
14550. after all the average american as he lies and	waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain	hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or	her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental	actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control	8144.04672406819
14551. anyone's identification with an international struggle whether	warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense	emotional involvement	1424.9733449218695
14552. such identification comes for each group in each	crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate	national heroes	2587.8115565643952
14553. in america such self-deception has served	a particularly useful purpose	375.9293207478111
14554. a heterogeneous people have needed it	to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and	ever-changing	land	3049.7534427890623
14555. but we must never forget most of the appropriate	heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs	almost always with conscious aims and ends	2837.179168654222
14556. parson weems's george	washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of	the uniting states	2119.228726688473
14557. abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of	the national constitution	375.75342473012876
14558. robert e lee represented the dignity	needed by a rebelling confederacy	755.4786110625073
14559. and their roles are paralleled by	those of patrick henry nathan hale andrew jackson davy crockett	theodore roosevelt and many many more	2181.520468044786
14560. therefore the	scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years	most of the legends that are created	to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are	the concept that an american national	folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend	7133.590198831417
14561. folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group	of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission	1571.214111138407
14562. it	has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions	rhymes and such literary forms of expression	2587.587388581908
14563. related to	written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written	form it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral	existence	2463.3431468424983
14564. though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies	it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter	3259.666582303754
14565. in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our	folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as	this	2029.715217423221
14566. enthusiastically americans have swept subliterary and bogus	materials like paul bunyan tales abe lincoln anecdotes and labor	union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition	4482.579225729488
14567. nor	have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of	isolated and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did	not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education	and industrialization	had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as	a means of carrying culturally significant material	5099.7135716236135
14568. naturally	such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make	money or fan patriotism by means of folklore	3247.072656342556
14569. that much of what he	calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people	with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction	to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant	4037.914996571323
14570. as long	as his material is americana can in some way be ascribed to the masses	and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied	3903.120132342739
14571. from all this we can now see that two streams of development	run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore	1875.282826609005
14572. on	the one side we have the university professors and their students trained	in teutonic methods of research who have sought out collected	and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic	regional and occupational groups that make up this nation	6789.814735773036
14573. on the other	we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been	willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material	willy-nilly	2594.6553451941722
14574. unfortunately few of the artists	who have used american folklore	since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams	even in the most general of ways	4467.665790324096
14575. after all the field is large difficult	to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates	1251.2358004352293
14576. in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many	heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of	print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and changing society	5511.572310995797
14577. the problems confuse even the experts	43.79754380838313
14578. for that matter	the experts themselves are a mixed breed	566.1573660491596
14579. anthropologists housewives	historians and such by profession they approach their discipline	as amateurs collectors commercial propagandists analysts or some combination	of the four	2324.666135083566
14580. they have widely varying backgrounds and aims	140.55031637908246
14581. they have little esprit de corps	43.55979543254074
14582. the outlook for the	amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local	history or for the picturesque	2830.3910513000474
14583. his love of folklore has romanticism	in it and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote	1730.2012836630406
14584. folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain	as such	1640.21916191036
14585. the amateur is closely related to the collector who is	actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field	2183.4085327338225
14586. the collector	enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the	very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game; and	only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has	located	6077.684624915426
14587. fundamentally both these types the amateur and the collector	are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between	real folklore and bogus material	2464.7245993463507
14588. but there are also the commercial	propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money the other	by nineteenth-century german scholarship	2832.376438705008
14589. both are primarily concerned	with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector	has found	1736.79546367805
14590. both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond	the sewage system and the electric light lines	2363.4451198033094
14591. the commercial propagandist	who can't afford to be critical gets along well with the	amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the analyst's	toes by refusing to keep his material genuine	3675.29430295713
14592. his standards are	of course completely foreign to those of the analyst	960.1079610497909
14593. to both the amateur	and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul lacks appreciation	with his endless probings and classifications	2043.5754872887173
14594. dominated by	the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks	down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although	he cannot deny his debt to the collector	5347.254201082842
14595. the knowledge that	most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial	propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors	2033.744781217873
14596. the work	done by the analysts the men who really know what folklore is all about	has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort	and reaches a limited learned audience	5673.173908758019
14597. publishers want books that	will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to	ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint	but moral material	3434.4047214453394
14598. the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit	in	752.6898699853128
14599. as a result most people don't have more than a vague idea what	folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming moral	legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown	in here and there	4134.010908129537
14600. and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur	and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the	hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment	and nationalism alone	5780.26312526601
14601. if one wishes to discuss a literary	figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize	is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american	public	3552.027129375839
14602. and while every writer must be dealt with as a special	case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions	about each	4095.095210884453
14603. does the writer know the difference between an ersatz	ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk	1893.492752239647
14604. when	the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial	effect or does he leave it pure	3043.417930661988
14605. is the writer propagandistic	2.945342972546741
14606. is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was	1179.6771856991354
14607. or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american	attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they	may be	2451.68590327569
14608. when he gets the answers to his questions he will be	discouraged	961.9219386549805
14609. in the first place a good many writers who are said to	use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or	tale	2467.813380939352
14610. robert frost for instance writes about rural life in new england	but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in	his poems	3674.3854779365456
14611. this has not however prevented publishers from labeling	him a folk poet simply because he is a rural one	1740.4402007171727
14612. in the second	place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than frost	to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make	no distinctions between genuine and bogus material	5485.255677221072
14613. stephen vincent	benet's john brown's body comes immediately to mind in this	connection as does john steinbeck's the grapes of wrath	and carl sandburg's the people yes	2880.4406704729936
14614. the last two writers	introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union	leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of	protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass	5787.627949512618
14615. folklore as	used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very	person using it	1571.8292671723184
14616. the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect	to nation or political attitude	1185.6825963813387
14617. in fact there is much evidence to	indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular	regional ethnic and occupational limits	2317.747034592435
14618. as part of the same arrangement torrio had in the spirit of peace	and good will and in exchange for armed support in the april election	campaign bestowed upon o'banion a third share in the hawthorne	smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade	4752.3493394980305
14619. the coalition	was to prove inadvisable	65.5001850738121
14620. o'banion was a complex and frightening	man whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour	into others'	1889.7537166548104
14621. he had a round frank irish face creased in a	jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets	into someone's body	4096.893981064499
14622. he carried three guns- one in the right	trouser pocket one under his left armpit one in the left outside coat	pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands	3107.674132431442
14623. he killed accurately	freely and dispassionately	65.4675076389743
14624. the police credited him with twenty-five	murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them	1569.7398210333922
14625. like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol	389.07002523147383
14626. he was an expert	florist tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths	937.6455825466692
14627. he had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity	into right guys and wrong guys and the wrong ones he	was always willing to kill and trample under	4686.564927580285
14628. he had what was described	by a psychologist as a sunny brutality	645.2438476950906
14629. he walked with a heavy	list to the right as that leg was four inches shorter than the other	but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns	4988.393233523415
14630. landesco	thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was	in fact with his aggression and hostility and nerveless indifference	to risking or administering pain a casebook psychopath	3218.8103755372085
14631. he was also	at this time although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets	as torrio and capone the most powerful and most dangerous mob	leader in the chicago underworld the roughneck king	5630.747925933951
14632. o'banion	was born in poverty the son of an immigrant irish plasterer	in the north side's little hell close by the sicilian quarter	and death corner	2725.4570972417055
14633. he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral	and also served as an acolyte to father o'brien	2826.8245935559594
14634. the influence	of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested slum tenements	among the bawdy houses honkytonks and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;	he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and	went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving police-dodging	and housebreaking	4746.115129591808
14635. at the age of ten when he was working as	a newsboy in the loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted	in his permanently shortened leg	4673.958550521596
14636. because of this he was known as	gimpy		79.07261143491465
14637. in his teens o'banion was enrolled in the vicious	market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern's	cafe a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street where	befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing	waiters before being thrown out	7231.075768811985
14638. he then got a job with the chicago	herald-examiner as a circulation slugger a rough fighter	employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon	by rival vendors	3326.6621848579684
14639. he was also at the same time gaining practical	experience as a safe breaker and highwayman and learning how to shoot	to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary later	committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac but whose eyes	misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish	mother in his clear and syrupy tenor	8510.890915481106
14640. o'banion's first conflict	with the police came in 1909 at seventeen when he was committed	to bridewell prison for three months for burglary; two years	later he served another three months for assault	3542.1909975519898
14641. those were his only	interludes behind bars although he collected four more charges on his	police record in 1921 and 1922 three for burglary and one for robbery	4484.133777540075
14642. but by now o'banion's political pull was beginning to be effective	499.5742883154783
14643. on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10000 bond was	furnished by an alderman and the charge was nolle prossed	3051.866501598075
14644. on one	of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant	john j ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour	office safe in the postal telegraph building; the jury wanted	better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of $30000	in bribes it was estimated	5367.299522413097
14645. as promptly as torrio o'banion jumped	into bootlegging	252.57196444330253
14646. he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous	violence than the sicilians but he had his huge north side	portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money	3345.646923504406
14647. unlike the	sicilians he additionally conducted holdups robberies and safe-cracking	expeditions and refused to touch prostitution	1889.5745343578667
14648. he was also personally	active in ward politics and by 1924 o'banion had acquired	sufficient political might to be able to state: i always deliver	my borough as per requirements	3224.380166700067
14649. but whose requirements	0.30041514999999996
14650. until 1924 o'banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had	kept his north side domain solidly democratic	1100.6822880932193
14651. there was a question-and-answer	gag that went around at that time: q who'll	carry the forty-second and forty-third wards	2585.5909873974083
14652. a o'banion	in his pistol pocket	43.73515703879111
14653. but as november 1924 drew close the democratic	hierarchy	was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o'banion	was being wooed by the opposition and was meeting and conferring	with important republicans	4972.967686836191
14654. to forestall any change of allegiance	the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o'banion	as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where	his loyalties lay	3346.5250890024827
14655. the reception was held in a private dining	room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west	2129.2311019564486
14656. it was an interesting	fraternisation of ex-convicts union racketeers ward heelers	sold-out officials and gunmen	1095.62019304662
14657. the guest list is in itself a little	parable of the state of american civic life at this time	2588.8339307367187
14658. it included	the top o'banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes	639.7919886300035
14659. when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes	for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department	by consorting with these felons and fixers	4667.7792255398
14660. hughes said that he had	understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o'connor the	proprieter of a loop gambling house	2318.5581017851755
14661. but when i arrived and recognised	a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective	bureau basement half a dozen times i knew i had been framed and	withdrew almost at once	5494.498397489919
14662. in fact o'connor was honoured	during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin	1254.5342633001437
14663. there was a brief interruption while one of o'banion's men	jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering	him for a tip	4463.9014955979255
14664. then o'banion was presented with a platinum	watch set with rubies and diamonds	790.9599265032278
14665. this dinner was the start	of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians	which prior to 1924 says pasley had been maintained with	more or less stealth but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious	gatherings denounced by a clergyman as belshazzar feasts	at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters	openly in the big downtown hotels	8468.809879848259
14666. pasley continued: they	became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the	moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments	in 1928-29	2984.0519970463993
14667. however this inaugural feast did its sponsors	no good whatever	556.3391528450213
14668. o'banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes	to his loyalty and proceeded with the bigger and better republican	deal	1885.4957319867767
14669. on election day- november 4- he energetically marshalled	his force of bludgeon men bribers and experts in forging repeat	votes	2813.0687534087083
14670. the result was a landslide for the republican candidates	263.61311543678914
14671. this further demonstration of o'banion's ballooning power	did not please torrio and capone	1172.6162186251734
14672. in the past year there had been	too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement	for their liking	1726.8498851839558
14673. he behaved publicly with a cocky swaggering truculence	that offended their vulpine latin minds and behaved towards	them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath	their blandness	4659.152766035867
14674. they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as	when his bodyguard yankee schwartz complained that he had been snubbed	by dave miller a prize-fight referee chieftain of a jewish	gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation who were hirschey	a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o'banion	frank a policeman and max the youngest	5409.703968185988
14675. to settle this	slight o'banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop	where he had learned dave miller was attending the opening of	a musical comedy	4686.74174616204
14676. at the end of the performance dave and max came	out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed	first nighters	2597.628173869012
14677. o'banion drew his guns and fired at dave severely	wounding him in the stomach	1408.7057691317393
14678. a second bullet ricocheted off max's	belt buckle leaving him unhurt but in some distress	1104.2002175025957
14679. o'banion	tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither	prosecuted nor even arrested	2364.3062607641104
14680. that sort of braggadocio for that sort	of reason in the view of torrio and capone was a nonsense	1713.407748950233
14681. a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was	when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street	and demanded $300 to let it through	4985.428560386312
14682. one of the beer-runners telephoned	o'banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and	reported the situation	1581.389184436675
14683. o'banion's reaction was: three hundred	dollars! to them bums	388.5848867417024
14684. why i can get them knocked off for	half that much	498.58032223051003
14685. upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle	squads to prevent trouble if o'banion should send his gunmen out	to deal with the hijacking policemen	3695.5788743215585
14686. but in the meantime the beer-runner	unhappy with this solution telephoned torrio and returned to	o'banion with the message: say dionie i just been talking	to johnny and he said to let them cops have the three hundred	4039.357106755131
14687. he	says he don't want no trouble	139.78696539885848
14688. but torrio and capone had	graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman	794.6329902124589
14689. for three years	since the liquor territorial conference torrio had with his elastic	patience and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent	warfare and disaster to business tolerated o'banion's impudent	double-crossing	5333.592069321024
14690. they had suffered in sulky silence the sight of	his sharp practice in cicero	940.4269384223813
14691. when as a diplomatic gesture	of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election	torrio had given o'banion a slice of cicero the profits from	that district had been $20000 a month	5916.902927753139
14692. in six months o'banion had	boosted the profits to $100000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure	to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the	suburb	3123.016376013716
14693. these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies	from the sheldon saltis-mcerlane and druggan-lake gangs	and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons;	once again o'banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation	of ill will	6347.284451749549
14694. the revenue from o'banion's cicero territory	went up still higher until the yield was more than the torrio-capone	takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago's south and	west sides	3338.5001950423803
14695. but he still showed no intention of sharing with the	syndicate	758.7949889698776
14696. at last even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still	and he tentatively suggested that o'banion should take a percentage	in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer	concession	3651.995213050633
14697. o'banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal	566.3919982498031
14698. still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o'banion	gang's seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car	load of canadian whisky worth $100000 and by one of the biggest	coups of the prohibition era- the sibley warehouse robbery	which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation	5026.7180089717385
14699. here was	stored $1000000 worth of bonded whisky	248.38535418482016
14700. these 1750 cases were carted	off in a one-night operation by the o'banion men who left in	their stead the same number of barrels filled with water	2852.2710383801077
14701. a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake	or a volcanic eruption	1887.4000154286791
14702. the most infamous of all was launched by the	explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the pacific	at 300 miles an hour devastated the coasts of java and sumatra	with waves 100 to 130 feet high and pounded the shore as far away	as san francisco	5016.870641050934
14703. the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic	inundations by huge waves	563.9259244749891
14704. whether or not plato's tale of	the lost continent of atlantis is true skeptics concede that the myth	may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times	3098.9011779229977
14705. indeed	a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea	in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists	in the biblical story of the flood	4655.403279528707
14706. one of the most damaging	tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november	1 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away	as the english coast	3556.8019180802394
14707. tsunami are rare however in the atlantic	ocean; they are far more common in the pacific	1880.6191019454159
14708. japan has had 15	destructive ones since 1596	167.23673493329056
14709. the hawaiian	islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years	1185.2506468568104
14710. in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled	into the inland sea; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and	boats in osaka bay	3097.089911493483
14711. a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869	washed away an entire town leaving only two forlorn trees	standing where the community had been	3692.926364247178
14712. in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed	27000 people and swept away 10000 homes	789.6215143877992
14713. the dimensions	of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement	963.7699216377989
14714. an ordinary	sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to	crest- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1000 feet in the	pacific	3331.385757312285
14715. but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes	as much as 600 miles from crest to crest	2825.1386905444774
14716. while a wind wave never	travels at more than 60 miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in	the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour	3348.6994081447883
14717. the greater	the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave;	lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of	the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity	6217.210787835868
14718. in	the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles	per hour	1427.4817920303428
14719. tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length	that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable	2338.2334739937664
14720. their amplitude	sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest	793.1293845452092
14721. usually it	is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build	up to their terrifying heights	2797.515995189954
14722. on the fateful day in 1896 when the	great waves approached japan fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells	1731.4749216253554
14723. not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea	strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what	had happened	4648.783637179435
14724. the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water	from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers drowning	thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore	3334.809848156652
14725. the	giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones	1181.3547769016504
14726. they	usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they pour into	a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions	2731.4814623258344
14727. generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell	not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers	3485.178486155814
14728. this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore	as the first great trough arrives	1745.357130777637
14729. reefs are left high and dry and	the beaches are covered with stranded fish	1426.6607063163153
14730. at hilo large numbers	of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach	1411.2176011541274
14731. many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives for some	minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore	3270.9200797353906
14732. after an earthquake	in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified	by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher	ground	3073.323789187606
14733. when a second quake came they dashed back to the beach	fearing that they might be buried under landslides	2582.728021340947
14734. just as they reached	the shore the first huge wave crashed upon them	787.1109242989803
14735. a tsunami	is not a single wave but a series	561.6217662566264
14736. the waves are separated by intervals	of 15 minutes to an hour or more	and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great	wave has crashed that it is all over	3676.3092458887645
14737. the waves may keep coming for many	hours	251.6811426709165
14738. usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the	biggest	791.8409484654043
14739. among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was	francis p shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography	one of the world's foremost marine geologists	4072.224738655567
14740. he was able to make	a detailed inspection of the waves	502.6160657528768
14741. their onrush and retreat he reported	was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling	1646.9171705782733
14742. the	third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest	374.2859888196913
14743. on some of the islands'	beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the	shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come	4673.867965523176
14744. in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high	501.93620584264846
14745. the highest waves	55 feet occurred at pololu valley	391.4179803966671
14746. scientists and fishermen	have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon	502.8397526972432
14747. during	a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night	963.2429494538676
14748. the	luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the	stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris	by the turbulence of the sea	3217.4096827034905
14749. japanese fishermen have sometimes	observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have	enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers	of bottom-living diatoms raised to the surface by the disturbance	5627.071048355601
14750. the	waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and	battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth	of 3000 feet	3229.8860822540028
14751. gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands	248.84476304987453
14752. the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in	hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised	by commander c k green of the coast and geodetic survey staff	3341.0630952563274
14753. it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber	which record the rise and fall of the water surface	3049.344960176485
14754. ordinary water	tides are disregarded	14.913313476837615
14755. but when waves with a period of between 10 and	40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding	oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit	5623.360168297516
14756. this in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the	station that a tsunami is in progress	1735.3150013535494
14757. such equipment has been installed	at hilo midway attu and dutch harbor	959.2873367934393
14758. the moment the alarm	goes off information is immediately forwarded to honolulu which	is the center of the warning system	1881.3471751636487
14759. this center also receives	prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the	pacific which are equipped with seismographs	3044.2413546890884
14760. its staff makes a preliminary	determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide	stations near the epicenter for a tsunami	2188.4918836818542
14761. by means of charts showing	wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is	possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival	at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific	6641.932479961719
14762. the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger	and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps	2035.239909019286
14763. all	of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system	and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work	smoothly	3688.2415668192175
14764. since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami	in the pacific but only one was of any consequence	1728.0402444457195
14765. on november 4	1952 an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula	1426.9053937023261
14766. at 17:07 that afternoon the shock was recorded	by the seismograph alarm in honolulu	935.2414534656409
14767. the warning system immediately	went into action	141.58120036892723
14768. within about an hour with the help of reports	from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quake's	epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees	east longitude	3454.7640495943224
14769. while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came	in from various points in the pacific	the hawaiian station made its calculations	and notified the military services and the police that the first big	wave would arrive at honolulu at 23:30 greenwich time	6709.458173231023
14770. it	turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946	789.4184788488631
14771. they hurled a	cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor knocked down telephone	lines marooned automobiles flooded lawns killed six cows	3265.338465117683
14772. but not a single human life was lost and property damage in the hawaiian	islands did not exceed $800000	1715.2494374123646
14773. there is little doubt that the	warning system saved lives and reduced the damage	1414.3867301871137
14774. but it is	plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough	785.948943636152
14775. in the	vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against	building homes on exposed coasts or at least a requirement that they	be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves	5638.72321184404
14776. the key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the	same	791.6566572431743
14777. life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the	sea to complex combinations in man	1873.9152575803869
14778. the land too is changing and	earthquakes are daily reminders of this	637.9719307647266
14779. earthquakes result when movements	in the earth twist rocks until they break	955.8840183017546
14780. sometimes this is accompanied	by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts	cannot be seen but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars	of earlier breaks once deeply buried	3554.3130229905264
14781. today's earthquakes are most	numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated	but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth	that has not had them	5323.615943484501
14782. the effects of earthquakes on civilization	have been widely publicized even overemphasized	643.1694449235176
14783. the role of	an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously	frightening but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular	disaster	4291.231475620385
14784. superstition has often blended with fact to color reports	261.5605275999918
14785. we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know	about the earth's interior for they send waves through the earth	which emerge with information about the materials through which they	have traveled	5481.966558084713
14786. these waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface	a liquid core begins and that it in turn has a solid inner core	2474.1207924038026
14787. earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface	but they do not occur at greater depths	2355.6532724315075
14788. two unsolved mysteries are	based on these facts	168.02460656242232
14789. as far down as 400 miles below the surface	the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to	twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking as rigid surface	rocks do	5775.933084172282
14790. if earthquakes do occur at such depths why not deeper	370.9651534378103
14791. knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been	applied in various fields	958.4989051888691
14792. in the search for oil and gas we make	similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from	them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation	of these resources	3555.719998463079
14793. we have also developed techniques for recognizing	and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the	ground which they generate	3056.7903436460865
14794. the following discussion of this subject	has been adapted from the book by	l don leet	1261.8895645573352
14795. at twelve	minutes after five on the morning of wednesday april 18 1906	san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake	3028.7752679337027
14796. a sharp tremor	was followed by a jerky roll	261.31093407715593
14797. ireland's county limerick near the river	shannon there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which	means garden of owen	3482.6425125737683
14798. undoubtedly none of the residents realize	the influence their town has had on american military history	or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name	2989.019721413676
14799. the cry garryowen!	bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was	the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes	sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese	in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists	in korea	7043.436105795983
14800. garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u s cavalry	regiment the fighting seventh	1103.9670269991777
14801. today a battle	cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern army esprit de corps	has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables	3697.7955599977868
14802. but don't	tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh especially in a	saloon on saturday night	1578.3050406040852
14803. of all the thousands of men who have	served in the 7th cav perhaps no one knows its spirit better than	lieutenant colonel melbourne c chandler	4078.3200443275555
14804. wiry and burr-headed	with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals chandler	is the epitome of the old-time trooper	2037.8660476653185
14805. the truth is however that	when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he	had ever ridden	was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded	was a pencil	5659.493736269112
14806. chandler had been commissioned in the medical	service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas	city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make	the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it	4679.245025686352
14807. though	he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other	desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces	3702.3787279922108
14808. the	next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer	of troop h 7th cavalry in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan	2733.7319074387274
14809. outside of combat he couldn't have landed in a tougher	spot	749.8760088059788
14810. first of all no unit likes to have a new co brought in from	the outside especially when he's an armchair trooper	2186.756963865022
14811. second	if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him it's	on maneuvers	2576.326093080781
14812. in combat helping your co make a fool of himself	might mean getting yourself killed	1089.7391385675141
14813. but in maneuvers with the top	brass watching him all the time it's easy	1413.18511143832
14814. chandler understood	this and expected the worst	94.31699553715858
14815. but his first few days with troop	h were full of surprises beginning with first sergeant robert	early	2343.569995935824
14816. chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice	508.23125713932114
14817. instead sergeant early was quiet sharp and confident	250.05425361251628
14818. he had	enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately	set about learning his new trade	1884.3980859929666
14819. there was no weapon early could not	take apart and reassemble blind-folded	962.5345424514051
14820. he could lead a patrol and	he knew his paper work	505.64298837254074
14821. further he had taken full advantage of the army's	correspondence courses	751.5840576062219
14822. he not only knew soldiering but mathematics	history and literature as well	639.7809931881503
14823. but for all his erudite	confidence sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold	1644.7021808386194
14824. he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh	375.8998610292122
14825. sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky	he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united	states army	4292.875282724809
14826. he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and	the regiment	791.5827428382576
14827. for example it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry	under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the	battle of the little big horn	4463.276035412044
14828. it didn't take captain	chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition	on his shoulders as commander of troop h	2727.3305224670435
14829. but what made the	load lighter was the realization that every officer non-com and trooper	was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop	and the regiment	5347.814228398019
14830. maneuvers over the 7th returned to garrison	duty in tokyo captain chandler still with them	1097.4295953647897
14831. it was the	7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial	palace of the emperor	2124.960648662643
14832. but still mel chandler was not completely	convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word garryowen	1579.1874187380902
14833. the final proof was a small incident	140.30238412309654
14834. it happened	at the st patrick's day party a big affair for a regiment which	had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains	of an irish march	3474.885099694442
14835. in the middle of the party chandler looked	up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above	the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen	4657.550887673137
14836. the faces belonged	to lieutenant marvin goulding his wife and their two children	783.9661425652318
14837. and	when the singing began it was the gouldings who sang the old irish	songs the best	2129.409495806086
14838. though there was an occasional good-natured	chuckle about marvin goulding the jewish officer from chicago	singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange	2990.1571293942307
14839. for marvin goulding like giovanni martini the bugler boy	who carried custer's last message or margarito lopez the one-man	army on leyte was a garryowen through and through	4463.333736022438
14840. it was no	coincidence	that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders	in the regiment	1412.339409104433
14841. and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen	395.72900554635197
14842. he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment	950.8627061806714
14843. one of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook	and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the	troop	4092.8808285577375
14844. even the mess sergeant bill brown a dapper cocky transfer	from an airborne division went out on the range	1722.038106725539
14845. the troop received	a new leader lieutenant robert m carroll fresh out of	rotc and bucking for regular army status	2815.1525786450648
14846. carroll was sharp	and military but he was up against tough competition for that ra	berth and he wanted to play it cool	2321.3610793444404
14847. so mel chandler set out to	sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold	a short time before	3699.0570818913234
14848. when the korean war began on june 25	1950 the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the	little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead	of leyte during world war 2 the 7th cavalry was not in the	best fighting condition	4918.036361249896
14849. its entire complement of non-commissioned	officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit	and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world	war 2	5310.256607800629
14850. just a month after the korean war broke out	the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat	1884.2790521393683
14851. from	then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting	in korea	1886.9081408179652
14852. one night on the naktong river mel chandler	called on that fabled esprit de corps	1095.5836402642067
14853. the regiment was dug in	on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building	up a concentration of crack troops on the other side	4645.131152416266
14854. the troopers	knew an attack was coming but they didn't know when and they	didn't know where	1412.6762212005099
14855. at 6 o'clock on the morning of august 12 they	were in doubt no longer	1638.9634098892934
14856. then it came against troop h	43.72695394396871
14857. the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full	force of 1000 men armed with russian machine guns attacked the position	held by chandler's men	4650.802038067542
14858. first came the	cannon fodder white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive	human battering ram	1412.3550434956155
14859. they were followed by crack north korean troops	who mounted one charge after another	1411.0762554598416
14860. they overran the 7th cav's	forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers over	piles of their own dead	1729.5229559851346
14861. another force flanked the company	and took up a position on a hill to the rear	1891.8408310906057
14862. captain chandler saw	that it was building up strength	258.82824364792316
14863. he assembled a group of 25 men composed	of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation the company clerk supply	men cooks and drivers and led them to the hill	4283.810060352703
14864. one of the more	seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll the young officer bucking	for the regular army	1419.6566250441924
14865. chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill	to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight	2589.274398203109
14866. then	mel chandler started up the hill	94.17598639685626
14867. he took one step two broke	into a trot and then into a run	1425.2600791705831
14868. the first thing he knew the words garryowen!	burst from his throat	647.4529022469502
14869. his followers shouted the old	battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran	2140.023797234175
14870. the koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned	down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire	2188.428839335986
14871. chandler looking to	right and left to see how his men were faring suddenly saw another figure	bounding up the hill hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry	as he ran	5004.552041591321
14872. it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued	with the spirit of garryowen	1100.7563284654602
14873. he had formed his own task force	of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge	3045.964898209969
14874. because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been	pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again	2176.2530848730903
14875. but an enemy	grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously	965.7563032638736
14876. he	went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face	of	the withering enemy fire	2041.8790883960223
14877. enemy reinforcements came pouring down	seeking a soft spot	396.79706421634285
14878. they found it at the junction between troops	h and g and prepared to counterattack	1103.4261472354538
14879. marvin goulding saw	what was happening	64.46166034419241
14880. he turned to his platoon	14.688702311809706
14881. goulding leaped to his feet and started forward	garryowen! on his lips his men following	1640.0900352638891
14882. but the bullets	whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding	fell dead	1253.6750733052663
14883. for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that	their lieutenant	the most popular officer in the regiment was dead	3038.6079004108
14884. then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and cursing screaming	and hollering garryowen! they charged into the enemy like	wild men	2473.3759072002485
14885. that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant	carroll had begun	962.6811971262889
14886. goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy	soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack	1417.2537712158053
14887. reinforcements	came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding's	platoon	1405.9333802141334
14888. the north koreans threw away their guns and fled	across the rice paddies	789.4716101621251
14889. artillery and air strikes were called in	to kill them by the hundreds	1171.0979787300275
14890. though bob carroll seemed to have	had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived	1577.4385912044713
14891. today he is a major- in the regular army	392.68679386009177
14892. so filled	was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was	over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment	2993.3207293901305
14893. after years of digging nights and weekends he put together the	big profusely illustrated book of garryowen and glory which	is probably the most complete history of any military unit	4836.195872644536
14894. the	battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle	cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off	2613.844891982513
14895. for nearly	a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the	regiment	2138.472871407944
14896. take the case of major marcus a reno who survived	the battle of the little big horn in 1876	1723.7570109222302
14897. from the enlisted	men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried	to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus	reno	4649.199069908396
14898. many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him	374.0598086356103
14899. but	when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice	made against him the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield	and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left	to be tortured by the sioux refused to say a harsh word against him	7777.424490651608
14900. he was a member of the fighting seventh	166.78162010656877
14901. although it was	at	the battle of the little horn about which more words have been	written than any other battle in american history that the 7th cavalry	first made its mark in history the regiment was ten years old by	then	6558.4959116686205
14902. brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment's	first permanent commander and like such generals as george	s patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military	prominence	custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare	4292.04255546216
14903. during	the civil war custer who achieved a brilliant record was	made	brigadier general at the age of 23	2588.795690195812
14904. he finished the war as	a major general commanding a full division and at 25 was the youngest	major general in the history of the u s army	2999.831726896088
14905. i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident in	the sense that everyone agrees with them	2576.1294410950704
14906. if they were walter lippmann	would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky and herblock	would have nothing to draw cartoons about	2329.057255254568
14907. i do mean however that	i take them for granted and that everything i shall be saying	assumption	the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish	a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom	and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular-	since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions	be enjoyed by the people of the united states	8785.889716591615
14908. i speak of the largest	possible measure because any person who supposes that these	conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons	without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human	assumption	these conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable	in the qualified sense i have indicated- without the prior defeat	of world communism	5295.609486657194
14909. this is true for two reasons: because communism	is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions;	and because communists have the will and as long as soviet	power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization	6097.556749536326
14910. moreover	as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions	throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of	their restoration becomes increasingly remote	2615.981326707016
14911. it	follows that victory over communism is the dominant proximate goal	of american policy	1411.3385700621418
14912. proximate in the sense that there are more distant	more positive ends we seek to which victory over communism	is but a means	2323.341269618684
14913. but dominant in the sense that every other objective	no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it	2351.1475183025477
14914. peace is a worthy	objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the	communists out of berlin then we must fight	2305.5416789225774
14915. freedom in the sense	of self-determination is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination	to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into	the sino-soviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postponed	5157.221743312996
14916. justice	is a worthy objective; but if justice for bantus entails driving	the government of the union of south africa away from the west	then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards	yet a while longer	4130.3257540931845
14917. prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing	higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient	guns to resist communist aggression then material sacrifices and	denials will have to be made	5467.590345632838
14918. it may be of course that such objectives	can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism;	my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be	resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant	world- the absence of soviet communist power	4805.461698930516
14919. power	this much having been said the question remains whether we	have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat communism-	and if so how those resources ought to be used	5320.438014146853
14920. this brings us squarely	to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power	1421.7668933494074
14921. i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that	it always has been that it always will be	3039.3883987376453
14922. and i suggest further	that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of	american policy-makers ever since we assumed free world leadership	in 1945 to deal with this problem realistically and seriously	4036.6147076310262
14923. in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting	the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them	into proper focus	4444.405671331822
14924. one was demonstrably false; the other for the	most part true	501.49911206958257
14925. the first was that america had become- or	was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power	2132.3278723139365
14926. i know i	do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention	1095.7332470121391
14927. you	may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment-	i certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all american	strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states	not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the	development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent	feature of us-soviet relations for the foreseeable future	8539.140110092627
14928. i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority	on those americans who have doubts and i think mr jameson	campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet	myth	3934.5280782170585
14929. suppose he says that the tables were turned and we	were in the soviets' position: there would be more than 2000	modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at 250 bases	in mexico and the caribbean	5918.08570324593
14930. overwhelming russian naval power would	always be within a few hundred miles of our coast	1098.0781339286639
14931. half of the population	of the us would be needed to work on arms just to feed	the people	2596.60608807404
14932. add this to the unrest in the countries around us where	oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity	2460.7065219202273
14933. add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would	severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the	missile field which is reputed to be our main strength	5168.118149399415
14934. if	we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of khrushchev's	nightmarish worries- or at least of the worries he might have if	his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage	3737.4758882037145
14935. the other charge was that america's political position	in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years	2114.781047006626
14936. the	contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it	ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to	see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it	4011.392774731676
14937. the argument was typically advanced in terms of us prestige	552.4588778643049
14938. prestige however is only a minor part of the problem; and	even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading	2183.8178799841457
14939. prestige	is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill	1409.6351058518683
14940. but contrary	to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important	for its own sake	1565.8659140257218
14941. only the vain and incurably sentimental among	us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed	by our strength as they ought to be	4287.714511897567
14942. the thing to lose sleep over	is what people having concluded that we are weaker than we are are	likely to do about it	2459.015472988681
14943. the evidence suggests that foreign peoples	believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union and	is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead	4480.649327049919
14944. this ignorant	estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes	very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically	do- namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be	the winning side	4358.379552609827
14945. to the extent then that declining us prestige	means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on	an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet	intimidation there is reason for concern	6044.9219806248275
14946. still these guesses	about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the	actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves	2474.8164422446825
14947. here	i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and	overwhelming but of political power- of influence if you will-	about which the relevant questions are: is soviet influence throughout	the world greater or less than it was ten years ago	6936.5832693592865
14948. and is western	influence greater or less than it used to be	639.826517588471
14949. in answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether	communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy	before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform	are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded:	the success of communism's war against the west does not depend	on such spectacular and definitive conquests	8241.796832434999
14950. success may mean merely	the displacement of western influence	262.53806353519667
14951. communist political	warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages	1179.5497455331438
14952. fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they	could not win the communists seek to undermine western power where	the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla	skirmishes	in mob uprisings in the streets in parliaments in clandestine	meetings of undercover conspirators at the united nations	on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences- preferably at	the highest level	5710.048343026812
14953. the soviets understand moreover that the	first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against	the west	3049.213231816561
14954. thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover	is to neutralize a country	942.3393260195078
14955. the second stage is to retain the	nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turning the	country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy	4093.157981826253
14956. and	this may be as far as the process will go	507.1264442928149
14957. the kremlin's goal is	the isolation and capture not of ghana but of the united states-	and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade	under a neutralist mask yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries	of the soviet foreign office	6673.187100095771
14958. to recite the particulars of	recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring	502.8103962324104
14959. six years ago	french indochina though in troubie was in the western camp	1182.996929766784
14960. today	northern vietnam is overtly communist; laos is teetering between	communism and pro-communist neutralism; cambodia is for all	practical purposes neutralist	2036.6123851454718
14961. indonesia in the early days of	the republic leaned toward the west	965.9208851308664
14962. today sukarno's government	is heavily besieged by avowed communists and for all of its neutralist	pretensions it is a firm ally of soviet policy	2446.1715154314384
14963. ceylon	has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly	hostile to the west	1656.7377851380224
14964. in the middle east iraq syria and	egypt were a short while ago in the western camp	1416.433104250276
14965. today the nasser	and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west are dependent	for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel;	in almost every particular follow the kremlin's foreign policy line	5322.867395486424
14966. a short time ago all africa was a western preserve	373.4015039513307
14967. never	mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination:	the point is that in the struggle for the world that	vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west	5500.236794481739
14968. today	africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging	it would seem into the soviet orbit	1591.1463686796574
14969. latin america was once	an area as safe for the west as nebraska was for nixon	1891.6859583003716
14970. today	it is up for grabs	43.17610466645239
14971. one latin american country cuba has become	a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast	1660.5213033387924
14972. in some countries	the trend has gone further than others: mexico panama and venezuela	are displaying open sympathy for castroism and there is no country-	save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently	arranged- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent	the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause	4974.386546786786
14973. only in europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the	surface	1415.72857757293
14974. the strains of neutralism are running strong notably in	england and even in germany	940.5249979064638
14975. what have	we to show by way of counter-successes	390.67194134774013
14976. we have had opportunities-	clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron	curtain	1575.8198061866563
14977. there was the hungarian revolution which we praised	and mourned but did nothing about	1404.9073157049531
14978. there was the polish revolution	which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable	to soviet interests	1734.9021051621676
14979. there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended	did not exist	953.111328565675
14980. only in one instance have we moved purposively	and effectively to dislodge existing communist power: in guatemala	1415.9286986107568
14981. and contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside	pressures and world opinion to bring down that communist	government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist	coup	d'etat	5322.672207792184
14982. we served our national interests and by so doing we	saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery	1735.2258542715358
14983. the first rattle of the machine guns at 7:10 in the evening	roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear	3265.48800185209
14984. sounds	exactly like last time	14.766388611526134
14985. the young man spoke steadily enough	but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven	1404.2495342196585
14986. the middle-aged man	said over and over why did i come here why did i come	here	1410.488152783238
14987. amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons	i heard the thumping of mortars	1641.9236308296254
14988. then the lights went out	14.718754318129303
14989. this was my	second day in vientiane the administrative capital of	laos and my thoughts were none too brave	2584.992416010631
14990. where was my flashlight	2.9551971609912426
14991. where should i go	4.466868170305814
14992. to my room	0.20041515
14993. better stay in the hotel lobby	where the walls looked good and thick	1186.3538805711778
14994. chinese and indian	merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters	641.6528174546714
14995. hotel	attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby	251.08528011472077
14996. a woman with a small	boy slipped in between them	372.451033425844
14997. she held out her hand to show that she had money	749.7110138527797
14998. the american	newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office	374.8930206859595
14999. but what	was the story	22.2527185532844
15000. had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this	far	258.99635864496736
15001. or was it another revolt inside vientiane	138.96116628253253
15002. let's	play hero i said	14.791428510597646
15003. let's go to the roof and see	141.16271754328696
15004. saves the moon	by 7:50 the answer was plain	259.7813798232955
15005. there had	been an eclipse of the moon	250.7676886782139
15006. a traditional lao explanation is that	the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all	possible noise ideally with firearms	2726.4519198403596
15007. the din was successful	too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had	begun	to spit it out again which meant good luck all around	4283.566888239341
15008. how	quaint it all seemed the next day	166.90076897687507
15009. a restaurant posted a reminder to	patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks	1872.7180197206048
15010. but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later	643.1040120045052
15011. and no wonder for vientiane the old city of sandalwood had	become the city of bullet holes	2121.033839765011
15012. i saw holes in planes at the	airport and in cars in the streets	940.3567184802771
15013. along the main thoroughfares hardly	a house had not been peppered	756.1420019490288
15014. in place of the police headquarters	was a new square filled with rubble	791.0451729771662
15015. mortars had demolished the	defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door	1633.8214837471085
15016. what	had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened	brick	783.5844284320217
15017. this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane	fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments	had ruled here in three days	4092.227826924959
15018. and now in march	all laos suffered a state of siege	502.386719794659
15019. the pathet lao forces held	two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more	1888.3002508752802
15020. throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush	and death	643.10789503397
15021. and it's all the more tragic because it's	so little deserved said mr j j a frans a belgian	official of the united nations educational scientific and cultural	organization	4681.071983088355
15022. we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with	the u n flag	786.9120177673383
15023. practically all the people of laos he	explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers and the means	and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel	plows	5487.2866988924425
15024. they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes	in ten or eleven thousand villages with an average of 200 souls	2175.9310032428566
15025. nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are	562.5546658291257
15026. they spread	over an area no larger than oregon; yet they include peoples as different	from one another as oregonians are from patagonians	2328.086388101613
15027. must be kept in harmony	what matters here is family loyalty;	faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis the spirits;	and to live in harmony with nature	5011.048682747834
15028. harmony in laos	0.20041515
15029. precisely said mr frans	4.409159810250076
15030. he spoke of the season of	dryness and dust brought by the monsoon from the northeast in harmony	with the season of rain and mud brought by the monsoon from the southwest	3474.5630412424116
15031. the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering	mekong river	749.0951583230365
15032. shy slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with	the frangipani by the wayside	947.8265156423031
15033. even life in harmony with death	65.22056541313515
15034. for	so long as death was not violent it was natural and to be welcomed	making a funeral a feast	1880.2702718914031
15035. to many a frenchman- they came	95 years ago colonized and stayed until laos became independent in	1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti	4483.114524085823
15036. yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen	around the globe	1098.5639437999525
15037. the pathet lao stiffened by communist veterans	from neighboring north viet nam were supplied by soviet aircraft	2122.7551927716836
15038. the royal lao army on the other hand was paid and equipped with	american funds	1097.6755235285343
15039. in six years u s aid had amounted to more	than $1	964.6545908705336
15040. 60 for each american- a total of three hundred million dollars	498.34506955916106
15041. we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened	to ignite another war among the world's giants	2812.862478436905
15042. even if it	did not how would this little world of gentle people cope with its	new reality of grenades and submachine guns	2307.879311890253
15043. to find out we	traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled in	the daytime at least by the royal lao army: from attopeu the	city	of buffalo dung in the southeast to muong sing the city of	lions in the northwest close to communist china	7108.042642913055
15044. we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil	between ruts all four wheels spinning uselessly	2172.8660590005006
15045. we flew in rickety	planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash	1402.4412028142701
15046. in the	end we ran into communist artillery fire	262.02798917411826
15047. we were bill	garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff whose	three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any	fighting man we met; boun my our interpreter; and myself	5352.741187350538
15048. boun my- the name means one who has a boun a celebration and	is therefore lucky- was born in savannakhet the border of paradise	2478.536059377724
15049. he had attended three universities in the united states	391.64044204758034
15050. but	he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane	including the royal capital luang prabang	2028.814491947811
15051. before the airplanes	came he said travel in laos was just about impossible	1183.8175263597905
15052. minister moves fast	alas so it almost proved for us too	499.82464919486
15053. to	go outside the few cities required permits	250.86785318659045
15054. and getting them seemed	a life's work	94.7749212373578
15055. nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured and	few soldiers could be spared as escorts	1879.854816084162
15056. we were told that to	the pathet lao a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 a fortune	in laos	1867.1962312879757
15057. everyone had heard of the american contractor who had	spurned an escort	957.3577729725087
15058. now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching	him barefoot from village to village as evidence of evil american	intervention	1723.976863323326
15059. although we enjoyed our rounds of the government	offices in vientiane with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation	in french we were getting nowhere	3679.363531370897
15060. we had nearly decided	that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true when we were invited	to take a trip with the prime minister	2720.5034002515326
15061. could we be ready in 15	minutes	140.07741263570102
15062. his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of	town and he was eager to be off	1883.9962844758982
15063. and	so after a flight southeast to savannakhet we found ourselves bouncing	along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun	oum of champassak a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket	and a ten-gallon hat from texas	6578.95031511008
15064. from his shoulder bag peeked the	seven-inch barrel of a luger	504.21065489940673
15065. the temperature rose to 105`	22.276813079609433
15066. with our company of soldiers we made one long column of reddish dust	787.5581721254268
15067. in keng kok the city of silkworms the prime minister	bought fried chickens and fried cicadas and two notebooks for me	3055.7040287968657
15068. then we drove on until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice	fields bouncing across their squat earth walls	2173.3555915839443
15069. it was a	spleen-crushing day	22.153509423595587
15070. an hour of bouncing a brief stop in a village to	inspect a new school or dispensary	1418.9009708010276
15071. more bouncing another stop a	new house for teachers a new well	958.397080844066
15072. then off again rushing to keep up	93.6979794546082
15073. but our two jeep mates- keo viphakone	from luang prabang and john cool from beaver pennsylvania-	were beaming under their coatings of dust	3485.989591048213
15074. together they had probably	done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century-	constructively	1733.5600109846946
15075. mr keo once a diplomat in paris and washington	was commissioner of rural affairs	1411.1972855632862
15076. john an engineer and anthropologist	with a doctorate from the london school of economics	headed the rural development division of usom the united states	operations mission administering us aid	3108.69904681745
15077. what	you see are self-help projects john said	249.13001140639858
15078. we ask the people	what they want and they supply the labor	636.9974983318895
15079. we send shovels cement	nails	and corrugated iron for roofs	561.9842199394109
15080. that way they have an infirmary	for $400	166.6514966727112
15081. we have 2500 such projects and they add up to a lot more	than just roads and wells and schools	2825.383011747533
15082. mr	keo agreed	0.20041515
15083. our people have been used to accepting things as	they found them he said	1405.6824358587237
15084. where there was no road they lived	without one	261.9962811273598
15085. now they learn that men can change their surroundings	through their traditional village elders without violence	1872.49561724151
15086. that's	a big step toward a modern state	169.2900180704938
15087. you might say we are in the nation-building	business	393.6227251519986
15088. in the villages people lined up to give	us flowers	374.1938194517472
15089. then came coconuts eggs and rice wine	141.7729373680927
15090. the prime minister	paid his respects to the buddhist monks strode rapidly among the	houses joked with the local soldiery and made a speech	2477.8268350002963
15091. the soldiers	are fighting and the americans are helping he said but in the	fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself	4106.000843209595
15092. then we were off again	14.852882038465983
15093. we did it for three days	64.67615773696028
15094. but	our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery	376.6475423175606
15095. crossing the 4000-foot	width of the mekong at champassak on a raft with an outboard	motor we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean	breeze	4486.345619125639
15096. then we hung overboard in the water	93.6671525837012
15097. briefly we rolled	over a paved road up to pak song on the cool bolovens plateau	1907.6290008249002
15098. the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood supported	by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines and fed rice	to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song	3544.216924183176
15099. keep souls in place	in the village of soukhouma which means	peaceful we had a baci	1893.1164859396104
15100. this is the most endearing of lao	ceremonies	165.76011981111725
15101. it takes place in the household a rite of well-wishing	for myriad occasions- for the traveler a wedding a newborn child	the sick the new year for any good purpose	4830.883503870961
15102. the preparations	were elaborate: flowers candles incense sticks rice wine dozens	of delicacies and pieces of white cotton string	1729.6999248032066
15103. the strings were	draped around flowers in tall silver bowls	560.3574589295106
15104. the	candles were lighted and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village	notables	943.9358682857455
15105. i was careful to keep my feet the seat of the least worthy	spirits from pointing at anyone's head where the worthiest spirits	reside	3703.3768785206403
15106. now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to	come and join us	934.7158486243603
15107. next he addressed himself to our souls	140.62607966543294
15108. a	man has 32 souls one for each part of the body	644.6793993657468
15109. those souls like to	wander off and must be called back	750.8871095294882
15110. with the divinities present	and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power	1258.6667235365996
15111. then one after another the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings	around our wrists	1418.3080813885867
15112. these were to be kept on to hold in the 32 souls	646.6838443012346
15113. as we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to john	cool and silently showed him his hand	2834.242939586395
15114. it had a festering hole as	big as a silver dollar	508.8657233670541
15115. we could see maggots moving	22.071946058360634
15116. john said:	i have some antiseptic salve with me but it's too late for	that	1092.4404441236218
15117. my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening	of religious and ethnic bonds	1643.0897448148305
15118. jewish identity was often confused	with social and economic strivings	375.55379552090966
15119. being jewish gives you tremendous	drive a boy remarked	395.1368932189825
15120. it means that you have to get	ahead	166.3822023260285
15121. when i pressed for a purely religious definition i encountered	the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and	a small residue of ethnic loyalty	4099.672712026399
15122. i like the tradition	a girl said	94.72887599066681
15123. i like to follow the holidays when they come along	561.8616121598245
15124. but you don't have to worship in the traditional way	373.5269243631037
15125. you can communicate	in your own way	140.35195343720096
15126. as i see it there's no real difference between	being jewish catholic or protestant	939.7994947700405
15127. another teen-ager	remarked: most jews don't believe in god but they believe	in people- in helping people	2112.163202172568
15128. still another boy asserted:	to be a good jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person	1881.692792114884
15129. when asked how this was different from being a good protestant	the boy answered it's the same thing	2363.358661687651
15130. this accords	with the study by maier and spinrad	263.64491926385824
15131. they discovered that although	42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the	protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings	of their religion only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this	conviction	6782.439760267896
15132. the most important aims of the jewish students were as	follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent;	to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence-	21 per cent	4043.062254318987
15133. nevertheless most of the teen-agers	i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even	envisioned joining a synagogue or temple	3048.554595979688
15134. however they were hostile	to jewish orthodoxy professing to believe in judaism but in a	moderate way	1403.0187201863878
15135. one boy said querulously about orthodox jews: it's	the twentieth century and they don't have to wear beards	2350.0852583077176
15136. the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked	force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds	1581.9577881112832
15137. we were brought	up that way was one statement which won general assent	1172.9717984393271
15138. i	want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which	a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism	2462.4952730397818
15139. still	another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons	since i'll be living in a suburb	2589.3536712307027
15140. intermarriage which	is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not	with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval	2732.244127484749
15141. most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic	grounds	753.6646551370314
15142. when you marry you want to have things in common a	girl said and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your	own background	2597.9428863519224
15143. a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle	west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered	with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities	that many middle class jews now regard as religious	5484.049072169886
15144. it appears	that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing	sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would	not travel on saturday and in addition required kosher food	3758.925536213238
15145. another	girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the	only orthodox girl in town	2124.449975360432
15146. this is no doubt inaccurate	but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the	nonobservant	1872.7284389765252
15147. one of the significant things about	jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented	2592.1040953940783
15148. sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college	age attend institutions of higher learning	1097.7558860515887
15149. this is substantially higher	than the figures for the american population at large- 45	1399.9753956306563
15150. 6 per	cent for males and 29	93.7368171154854
15151. 2 per cent for females	22.201951967509746
15152. this may help explain	a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy	644.1209515040644
15153. in their first two	years in high school jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions	to win positions on the school teams	3467.287515278983
15154. however in their junior and	senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably	in the interest of better academic achievement	2038.083161790598
15155. it is significant	too that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed unlike the	younger ones that jewish students tend to do better academically than	their gentile counterparts	4281.038393973424
15156. the percentage of jewish girls	who attend college is almost as high as that of boys	1260.4962063972375
15157. the motivations	for both sexes to be sure are different	558.6144924124583
15158. the vocational motive is	the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social	reasons and to become culturally developed	2187.5214015160336
15159. one of the significant	developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers	are largely the women	2130.814928176088
15160. it is they who read- and make- jewish	best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them	1400.4606901370742
15161. in	upper teen jewish life the non-college group tends to have a sense	of marginality	1645.3009703052703
15162. people automatically assume that i'm in college	a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably	643.4194122403841
15163. however among	the girls there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going	to college	1413.1495302427568
15164. the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an	office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and buttressed	by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live	more expansively than the college student	3877.7963182067915
15165. she is even prone to regard	the college girl as immature	759.6170583193737
15166. one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers	in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend	local colleges at modest cost	3099.700937087347
15167. this is particularly true in large centers	of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia	1869.4877658861546
15168. what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is	that although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their	gentile counterparts	they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed	jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish	world	4206.0351854176215
15169. perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college-	constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can	serve as a paradigm of the urban lower-middle class jewish student	4822.433835528795
15170. there is to begin an important sex difference	167.4294953997205
15171. typically in	a lower-middle class jewish family a son will be sent to an out-of-town	school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will	attend the local college	4654.915510683751
15172. there are two reasons for this	43.20795111694108
15173. first	the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's	758.4997656101725
15174. second	the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter	than toward the son	1419.6972963800176
15175. most jewish mothers are determined to exercise	vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by	keeping them home	3044.1639271393733
15176. the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn	college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically	1729.5715355907498
15177. one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town	1178.1687113073299
15178. brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their	school	375.0596446274587
15179. on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond	the ambiance of their high school	2584.4073271774605
15180. this is particularly acute for	those who attended midwood high school directly across the street	from brooklyn college	1571.8660827479366
15181. they have a sense of marginality at being denied	that special badge of status the out-of-town school	2127.1060381881985
15182. at the same	time there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good	college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable	virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling	that the college generates	4126.496799440821
15183. it's people of your own kind a girl	remarked	393.5816803179234
15184. you don't have to watch what you say	166.8703632572311
15185. of course	i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds	of people but i would want lots of jewish kids there	4274.888682152059
15186. for	most brooklyn college students college is at once a perpetuation	of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood	and family	2745.933363349357
15187. rooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in	tone and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably	midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing	3911.6425093661587
15188. however a	growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by	courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly	critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents	2996.151987119389
15189. and	the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional	conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they	view as softly and insidiously enveloping	4838.632976828617
15190. as long as i'm home	i'll never grow up a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly	942.658112989534
15191. they don't like it if i do anything away from home	756.8122653307286
15192. it's so	much trouble i don't usually bother	165.59129057763582
15193. for girls the overprotection	is far more pervasive	251.32406820163152
15194. parents will drive on friday night	to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting	1587.5513430720807
15195. a freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn	college and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out	with his daughter	4458.790342293215
15196. the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice	of a major field	646.1432876298303
15197. under pressure from parents the majority of brooklyn	college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with	marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient	working hours	4497.856212814333
15198. this means that a great many academically talented girls	are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature	1902.9122238112748
15199. a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls	as it does in the realm of sex	2824.8819690941277
15200. the breaking away from the prison	house of brooklyn is gradual	502.2572454326672
15201. first the student trains on his	hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological	and sociological insights	2576.968979509954
15202. then with the new affluence there is	actually a sallying forth into the wide wide world beyond the precincts	of new york	2180.407716269135
15203. it is significant that the catskills which used to	be the summer playground for older teen-agers a kind of summer suburb	of new york no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for	those who work there as waiters bus boys or counselors in the day	camps	7118.719247502499
15204. the great world beyond beckons	14.704125277043227
15205. but it should be pointed out	that some of the new watering places- fire island nantucket westhampton	long island for example- tend to be homogeneously jewish	4077.302043549205
15206. although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad	program a good number of students spend summers in europe	1722.270141870808
15207. in	general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that	of the student at harvard or smith	2347.84128428796
15208. and acculturation into the world	at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after	college rather than during the four school years	2596.46411223654
15209. brooklyn	college is marjorie morningstar territory as much as the bronx or	central park west	1650.4837230285775
15210. there are hordes of nubile young women there	who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry	1574.7728290861994
15211. it is interesting that although the percentage of married students	is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per	cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class-	the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate	7023.286202072406
15212. almost	everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically	503.52192573537104
15213. and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities	and houses that have good	news to impart	2348.2842697401284
15214. these announcements are in effect advertisements	for themselves as thriving marriage marts	642.617850773055
15215. there are boxed proclamations	in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagements and	marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity	3026.753110287911
15216. witt house	happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz	of fife house	1097.3833409366962
15217. the brooklyn college student shows	some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models	973.4915577011554
15218. the ivy	league enjoys no easy dominion here and the boys are as likely to	dress in rather foppish continental fashion or even in nondescript	working class manner as they are in the restrained button-down ivy	way	3961.1867997086215
15219. the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts	out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant	hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel-	are not unknown even in early morning classes	6036.806009094961
15220. among the	boys there is very little bravado about drinking	373.84667874871127
15221. brooklyn college	is distinctive for not having an official drinking place	750.3568801495139
15222. the fort lauderdale	encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college	boys	787.4806789832135
15223. this should be used frequently	22.37875702579661
15224. for galled	breasts the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard	enough white chalk to make a paste	2178.553287909915
15225. this could also be used for any	other skin irritation	558.8814814574182
15226. or she might place cornstarch in the oven for	a short time and then apply this under her breasts	1734.4955694541575
15227. female	troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the	frontier; at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind	in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation	5601.669780707374
15228. the sufferer	drinks tansy tea	14.729117445815977
15229. bruises burns cuts etc occurred frequently	on the frontier and folk medicine gave the answers to these	problems too	2609.6433670540414
15230. bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of	raw beefsteak	496.63868140498363
15231. salted butter was	another	cure for bruises	140.51517476898843
15232. many people agreed that burns should be treated	with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard but one informant	told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed	watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by	bathing it with epsom salts	5003.480984680019
15233. another swore by vinegar baths for burns	and still another recommended salted butter	1181.4292125726165
15234. butter salve or	butter ointment was used for burns and for bruises as well	941.7365863358318
15235. this	was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;	when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled	4264.949174905038
15236. cow's	milk was another cure for burns and burns covered with gum arabic or	plain mucilage healed quickly	1572.0964737926502
15237. one man badly burned about the face and	eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor	at the time	3903.6927667085547
15238. a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings	which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat	2322.2136728297373
15239. later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns	395.5469122938273
15240. the results	were good but which treatment helped is still not known	635.6024030329338
15241. to	stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds	557.6965425075297
15242. one old-timer	said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut even when on a knuckle if it	was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent	infection	3458.8431764263005
15243. my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy	for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury	and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth over which she poured	turpentine	5768.842102275134
15244. he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically	amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar	showing	2472.948822660116
15245. tobacco was common first aid	22.247956874493266
15246. a chaw of tobacco put	on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing	948.533420466505
15247. or a thin slice	of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing	1874.8580315085794
15248. one	old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a	fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his	head	3671.8000601056838
15249. his brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached	the boy the father sliced a new plug of tobacco put the scalp back	in place and covered the raw edges with the slices	5787.40684463409
15250. then he put a rag	around the dressing to keep it in place	790.80481256877
15251. there was no cleaning or further	care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no	scar	2829.436646802571
15252. veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding	and rue was an antiseptic	1263.8735598027624
15253. until quite recently sterile maggots	could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface	leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated	4652.840440149549
15254. tetanus	could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound	502.11599939183253
15255. one family	bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips or if these were not	handy plain lard	2355.523456547232
15256. another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the	wounded foot or hand in the smoke	1260.5240810902187

15259. another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds	then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker	2367.411177389982
15260. while nowadays	we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at	the nose not long ago a nosebleed was simply that and treatment had	little	variation	3101.428030928072
15261. since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack	was usually first aid	1875.5051295735666
15262. this might be applied to the top of the nose	or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the	nostril	2745.270405635562
15263. nosebleed could be	stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and	tying in it a knot for each year of his life	4092.0062259266283
15264. or the victim could chew	hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in	his ears	1726.1624429487347
15265. old sores could be healed by the constant application	of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water	2587.5896462960527
15266. blood blisters could	be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with	any hard nonpoisonous substance	1561.6694772605363
15267. felons were cured by taking common	salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal	parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on	a cloth and wrapped around the affected part	6309.623205452296
15268. as the cloth dried more	of the mixture was applied and after twenty-four hours the felon was	supposed to be killed	2024.4366889655134
15269. insect bites were cured in many	ways	141.0210240576544
15270. many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; get a bite	spit on it was a proverb	1411.4737044769156
15271. this was used also for bruises	65.53462992943913
15272. yellow	clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings;	not long ago denver mud was most popular	2183.6908245409363
15273. chiggers were a	common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so	small as to be scarcely visible to the eye they buried themselves in	the victim's flesh	4841.259248948688
15274. bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief	and also killed the pests	794.5624650414496
15275. ant bites were eased by applying liquid	bluing	250.62993775242703
15276. for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half	a glass of soda was made	1722.3289817517445
15277. for wasp stings onion juice obtained by	scraping an onion gave quick relief	1184.5009175715732
15278. a handier remedy was to bathe the	painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well	as soap	2021.0338818394034
15279. just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve	wasp or bee stings	2125.626591957793
15280. bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days;	to keep them out of homes even in the 1900's was a chore	2015.8604116442452
15281. bed	slats were washed in alum water legs of beds were placed in cups	of kerosene and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate	applied with a feather	4630.814457775916
15282. kerosene was very effective in ridding	pioneer homes of the pests	501.83971486139336
15283. at times pioneer children got lice in their	hair	392.85590966327476
15284. a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the	job	635.9930628256657
15285. to remove an insect from one's ear warm water should	be inserted	963.0928977600357
15286. a cinder or other small object could be removed from the	eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye	1731.0054636861926
15287. as the seed swelled its glutinous	covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder	and the seed could soon be washed out	3696.219488555399
15288. another way to remove small	objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle	would then move toward the nose where it could be wiped out with	a wisp of cotton	3762.930175370013
15289. shingles were cured by gentian an old drug	used in combinations	754.5401866441293
15290. for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and	one	ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth	2043.7190654806795
15291. itching	skin considered just nerves was eased by treating with	whiskey and salt	1187.749873498463

15293. to cure fungus growths	on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of	sassafras bark in a quart of water	3892.0826445227417
15294. they drank half a cup of this morning	and night and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same	solution	2178.2306452380317
15295. six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and	had defied other remedies	1419.2430716526235
15296. frostbite was treated by putting the feet	and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow	1564.94635433999
15297. now one hears that	heat and hot water are used instead	755.4382198956012
15298. another remedy was oil of eucalyptus	used as well for chilblains	501.13927198217027
15299. chilblains were also treated with	tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves	751.5131300980844
15300. boils have always been	a source of much trouble	260.9856281470454
15301. a german informant gave me a sure cure	made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice	2349.026264036761
15302. another poultice	was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water	until it formed a sticky gummy solution	2183.216562137296
15303. this was also used for sores	65.28555914364937
15304. another frequent pioneer difficulty caused by wearing rough and heavy	shoes and boots was corns	1098.901194737118
15305. one veracious woman tells me she has	used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they	remove the pain or fire	4096.449131719684
15306. another common cure was to soak the	feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of	equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight	3649.216395348843
15307. this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed	the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on	4485.735622781385
15308. there were many cures for warts	43.152552717740406
15309. one young girl told me how her	mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in	vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several	times	5440.873717089153
15310. another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a	bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the	house for seven days	3218.2031480310825
15311. saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's	sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on	wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear	after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did	just that	7001.921589851101
15312. one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy	941.0463985194638
15313. another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours tie	it on the wart and wear it for a week	3260.9297441269364
15314. a simpler method was to tie	a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way	1876.9086289226404
15315. one person recommended to me washing the wart with	sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato	three times daily	3656.722454142714
15316. another common method was to cut an onion in two and	place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened	together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave	3651.1092303600417
15317. as the	onion decayed so did the wart	248.99208664477297
15318. sore muscles were relieved by	an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot an herb from the pioneer's	ubiquitous herb garden or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water	in which two cups of salt had been dissolved	4225.355660403133
15319. leg cramps one person	tells me were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the	body on the heel and pressing down hard	3682.020639702915
15320. this does give relief as i	can testify	168.28846708667126
15321. one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy	before each meal for leg cramps	1646.1068156293818
15322. pains in the back of the leg and in	the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope	about the patient's waist	2747.399541231406
15323. for sprains and swellings one	pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added	to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief	4656.181489488872
15324. except for the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable	plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the keys to unlock	the gates of the wine world are one's dealer and the foreign shipper	or negociant who in turn supplies him	4310.8135045084655
15325. in instances where	both of these are persons or firms with integrity the situation is ideal	1894.687209234262
15326. it may on occasion be anything but that	166.16084780591027
15327. however by cultivating	a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain	whether he has any knowledge of wines	and better yet whether he	has a taste for wine	5172.839104616909
15328. again by spreading one's purchases over several	wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties	of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad	2460.12453903901
15329. this is important because	despite all the efforts of the french government an appreciable	segment of france's export trade in wines is still tainted with a	misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty and there are many	too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a	creditable reputation overseas	7342.715381302523
15330. a good negociant or shipper	will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from	the best vineyards or the best parts of them; he may also be the	one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards	generally in his own district	5050.686845661314
15331. these are the wines the french themselves	use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one	drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis	4095.886065406981
15332. the grands	crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them	636.1795304288165
15333. and certainly	in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine	drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready	for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse	to crus of less renown	6453.086574358854
15334. there is nothing infra dig about a	good blend from a good shipper	798.4147658056552
15335. some of them are very delicious indeed	and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately along with	others not so good and worse	3496.104921083236
15336. consultation with a reputable wine dealer	and constant experimentation- steering ever from the known to	the unknown- are the requisites	1888.6784221052883
15337. wine waiters are something	else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great	deal their importance mounts	2828.5955397658026
15338. most of them the world over operate	on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and	some other latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty	of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof	on the customer himself	4608.23915430084
15339. now the drinking of wine	is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone	in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the	supply would dry up in no time at all	6217.646679567795
15340. this is the only valid and extenuating	argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible	attitude of the common wine waiter	2306.274142935809
15341. a really good wine waiter is	paradoxically the guardian of his cellar against	the visigoths	1653.1320013936443
15342. faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible	supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped	with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine	waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence	4300.009125887131
15343. the one way to	get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking	to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter	is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending	money	6652.969089351798
15344. only then perhaps will he reveal his jewels and his bargains	501.35241398741647
15345. wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest	for several weeks before it is served	2356.6635105738137
15346. this is especially true of	red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well	worth the effort	1887.1975614138519
15347. it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter	of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal	3870.338292385998
15348. wine stored	for a long time should be on its side; otherwise the cork dries	and air enters to spoil it	2018.2033852170177
15349. when stacking wine on its side in a bin	care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next	to the cork	4270.755014231057
15350. fat bottles such as burgundies have a way of rolling	around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard	or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture	4045.6266056516906
15351. too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects	1181.1133091392005
15352. the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine	is to smell the wet end of the cork after	pulling it: if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right;	if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion	4379.789404879772
15353. seasonal	rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely	1404.2483933581148
15354. the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five	degrees with an allowable range of five degrees above or below	this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes	3198.883572008269
15355. prolonged vibration	is also undesirable; consequently one's wine closet or cellar	should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces	2838.9482162936865
15356. if	one lives near a subway or an express parkway the solution is to have	one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time	3120.5713909520045
15357. light especially daylight is always bad for wine	251.0605962762882
15358. all in	all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations	thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go	to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without	further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious	cork	4778.565444023252
15359. a white wine already at cool	cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and	water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator	in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter	climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow	4902.452305971366
15360. though	by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought	from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so	before serving time	4860.836749587308
15361. it may be a bit cold when poured; but again	as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should	be served in a large tulip-shaped glass which is never filled more	than half full	4038.8263698336887
15362. in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly-	and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste	and fragrance until after the middle of the meal in	the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting	stages	7220.854090183767
15363. the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming	a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an	open fire	3214.2810146545385
15364. this invariably effaces any wine's character and drives	its fragrance underground	752.6411792100955
15365. it should not be forgotten that	wines mature fastest in half-bottles less fast in full bottles slowly	in magnums- and slower yet in tregnums double magnums jeroboams	methuselahs and imperiales respectively	3319.279345833449
15366. very old red wines	often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from	the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed	some air	5029.365938498374
15367. but white wines never! white wines should be opened	when served having been previously chilled in proportion to their	sweetness	1869.964531435761
15368. thus sauternes or barsacs should be very cold; a pouilly-fuisse	or a chablis somewhat less cold	1890.356792951178
15369. over-chilling is an accepted	method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white	wine especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving	a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive	4231.625633943273
15370. the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death	when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air	4279.320271628001
15371. if	this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place;	it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably	shorter than those of milk	5010.39378758977
15372. a few red wines notably those	of the beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature	1093.4832511238858
15373. by	tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-	if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin	and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well	5765.360710439033
15374. thus	red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken; very old	red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which	have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself	4044.8775327028025
15375. a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may	do as much harm as a week at sea	2831.690554619016
15376. the cork should be pulled gradually	and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward	1260.459270239228
15377. many	people use wicker cradles for old red wine lifting the bottle carefully	from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without	disturbing the sediment	4509.288628076502
15378. another school frowns on such a shortcut and	insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand	on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom	after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position	on its side in the cradle	5205.2575590581455
15379. in france when one wishes to entertain	at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines one visits the	restaurant well ahead of time chooses the wines and with the advice	of the manager and his chef builds the menu around them	6699.012118358131
15380. the wine	waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened	at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allowed to stand on	end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines	be decanted	4733.386555971847
15381. decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be-	practically speaking- a matter of good economy	2115.8662265352054
15382. for in the process	of decanting the bottle is only tilted once instead of several	or more times at the table: hence a minimum of the undesirable mixture	of wine and dregs	3454.2619759800773
15383. though there are many exceptions which	we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed	between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three	and ten	5486.22933946508
15384. red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep	longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite	number red burgundy	2579.9847045006222
15385. some clarets do not come into their own until	they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more	2842.882189359046
15386. if a red bordeaux	of a good name and year is bitter or acid or cloying and muddy-tasting	leave it alone for a while	2467.9375293438543
15387. most of the wines of beaujolais on	the other hand should be drunk while very young; and alsatians	may be	2806.8193985684215
15388. giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: rest assured that	your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter	and spirit strictly complied with h and most particularly in regard	to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane	views	4515.716666643601
15389. giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation	249.77014623054907
15390. the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey's	overseer	1100.2813913419043
15391. an excellent crop was expected that year	139.8546732739889
15392. william	who lived in neighboring st mary's parish had taken charge and	decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated	for another year	2980.47689980004
15393. giffen advised acceptance of this plan citing the	depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions	at the plantation	3468.345716147583
15394. if sold then the land and improvements might	bring only $5000	506.4116228706157
15395. early in january 1844 he had a conference with	henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorham's	intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother	4686.132024745853
15396. the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs	he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless	negroes	2739.2138107065475
15397. they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation	and louisiana law required their removal from the state	2613.5181831077293
15398. gorham	refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how	much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the	north involved	2717.5109316554926
15399. the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was	not realistic since no planter would take the risk of having negroes	who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves	5313.218535558402
15400. henry hid	his annoyance although both he and william were furious with their	yankee brother	1099.6175396125966
15401. william who did not write to gorham told giffen	that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would	sue amicably to protect his interests	4661.663977447478
15402. palfrey was	determined	that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers	during the transition period before emancipation	1881.2859083632877
15403. if william wished	to continue operations for a year why not simply leave the negroes	undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever	paid the labor of persons of their sex + age	4550.941953908964
15404. a disposition to exert	themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them	h to come into the scheme	2328.0375885221347
15405. their having family ties on our plantation	+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement	966.3175394322864
15406. when he heard	of his brothers' anger palfrey was still hopeful that they could	be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages	2300.627915896057
15407. if not he was willing	to accede to william's wishes in any way that did not block	his ultimate aim	2789.4492617117307
15408. william was adamant on one point: under no circumstances	would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his	and henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom	3446.704246030429
15409. knowing	the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the	number of free negroes giffen suggested that palfrey bring them	to boston at once and then send them on to liberia	4971.758638242611
15410. lacking specific	instructions he agreed to william's condition	166.60228599119506
15411. in march	there was a division of the slaves and giffen carried out his instructions	as nearly as possible	2595.534121768113
15412. of the fifty-two slaves giffen succeeded	in getting a lot of twenty twelve of whom were females	1405.800584079557
15413. i considered	that your views would be best carried out he explained	by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend	the philantrophy of emancipation	3384.8362620056528
15414. i have also taken the old servants	of your father as a matter of conscience + justice	749.1449268134912
15415. the ages	of the slaves ranged from sixty-five for an old house servant to	an unnamed newborn child	2377.326090932095
15416. if palfrey ever had any doubts about the	wickedness of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory	of the slave property he had inherited	2868.870238135303
15417. this cold reckoning of human	worth in a legal paper devoid of compassion or humanity was all	he needed	2585.228440337554
15418. each human being known only by a given name had a cash value	797.4984494094888
15419. old sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;	rose a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential was worth $400	2593.3656613147537
15420. in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property palfrey	was giving up close to $7000	1567.1049762245855
15421. palfrey's brothers each received	lots of sixteen negroes and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed	that all lots were to be valued at $6666	3661.4497236717516
15422. thus twenty black	souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land	of free men	1565.7072871859878
15423. giffen extracted one concession from william: the house	servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient	2366.411912250106
15424. despite giffen's warning palfrey still had plans for freeing	his slaves in louisiana	788.879758390217
15425. yet even if he could get the necessary approval	fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special	permission	2809.1139596461044
15426. according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty	years old before he could be freed	1737.5241953811612
15427. palfrey petitioned the state legislature	to waive the requirement	394.6926049565168
15428. otherwise freedom would mean removal	from the state in which as the place of their past residence from	birth or for many years it would h be materially for their advantage	to be at liberty to remain	3966.1810710405066
15429. on march 11 the louisiana legislature	voted unanimously to table the petition	959.1429368282932
15430. news of the legislative	veto appeared in the new orleans papers and henry and william	became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt	in advance	3340.472119778209
15431. henry stormed into giffen's office waving a copy of	the new orleans courier shouting that the emancipation scheme	had become a public affair and that it would reach the ears of the	people on the plantation and make them restless + unhappy	5121.50896760764
15432. his brothers' anger caused palfrey genuine concern for he had	imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves and to keep	the family from falling apart over the issue	3356.820607286952
15433. when giffen decided	to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey gorham readily	assented vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers	would never have any cause to complain of him	5769.25033196844
15434. in view of these	difficulties palfrey decided to go to louisiana	506.8715810869864
15435. giffen had already	urged him to journey south if only for a few days to clear up matters	2353.5188876548536
15436. his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him	to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april	1728.1419462701276
15437. palfrey	told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for new	orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence	that he might be allowed to see his family again	5302.749918866081
15438. during his journey	palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists	373.89659422069394
15439. in both cases he	desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived	in the north	2342.847840753854
15440. in new york lydia maria child welcomed him	enthusiastically: i have lately heard of you from the legislature	of louisiana and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood	of man	3436.9119234228574
15441. mrs child who had once apologized for sending	editor palfrey a book on slavery now confided that she had helped one	of henry palfrey's slaves escape to canada some years before	but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana	6463.705003044996
15442. she agreed to	take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send	them north immediately	1866.7796079602674
15443. at lexington kentucky palfrey consulted	with cassius m clay on the same subject but with no apparent	result	2362.1971700213426
15444. despite his apprehensions about his personal safety	palfrey's reception in new orleans was more than cordial	1256.196236137025
15445. instead	of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission	he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark	on whom i had no sort of claim + have had many more invitations	than i could accept	4988.425772035797
15446. he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of	the marked attention and civility with which the new orleans	gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him	2461.2015927821717
15447. the memory of this southern	hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years	and civil war	2351.089755044229
15448. palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic	account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas	many of whom were coarse + passionate people much excited by what	they heard of my plans	2550.598337981649
15449. he proceeded with his task bravely- in	his memoirs at least- before the passions of my neighbors should	have time to boil too high	3686.4913233540146
15450. palfrey had already made up his	mind that he would allow the men but not the women to choose freely	whether or not to go north for freedom	2986.8821433433995
15451. the women by remaining behind	condemned their children born and unborn to bondage	1188.1462345456284
15452. he had a	short private talk with each adult slave	374.8794599047592
15453. only one objected but palfrey	soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others	1885.4803515681774
15454. all the	slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure	until the end of the planting season so that they could get in their	own little produce	3319.830351897701
15455. palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain	as wage laborers for his account	1178.7935704618308
15456. william's threat that under	no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with	his own was not carried out for the plantation continued in operation	as before	2992.9033708056622
15457. palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to	have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience	1470.2943818889817
15458. from cambridge palfrey maintained a close interest	in the welfare of his slaves	795.5172590370879
15459. in fact as the time for their departure	approached his solicitousness increased	966.240580096582
15460. should any slave change	his mind and request to leave earlier giffen was to provide passage	at once	1574.4453715913064
15461. when a sailing date of march 1845 was finally	established	palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters	in new orleans and aboard ship	4093.0219492189017
15462. giffen assured him that the captain	and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration	1579.9542036997532
15463. palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage	to pay for their labor throughout 1844	2119.4455239573344
15464. the plantation was sold in january	1845 and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people	two months' wages	2025.8859375681714
15465. giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation	for a year's work; the new owner at attakapas declined to	enter into any philanthropic arrangement	3477.7439573268994
15466. on march 21 1845 the	bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans while on the levee	henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father's former	chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled	regret and jubilation	4312.277133521205
15467. not all of palfrey's slaves were	aboard the bashaw	393.021814195073
15468. giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult	to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants	1718.9475921923972
15469. two of	these were included in palfrey's lot	248.75085450843835
15470. giffen filed a petition for	permission to emancipate four slaves	with the st martin's parish police jury	1425.765780593788
15471. after an initial rejection	which he attributed to a general excitement against abolition	and emancipation giffen bribed the right individuals on the	jury and got the permission without further delay	4868.033203891692
15472. when the	negroes landed at boston a month later they were of course no longer	slaves	1250.14762244215
15473. slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of	the constitution of 1780 which declared all men are born free and	equal	3258.6038385130187
15474. nevertheless palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king's	chapel to formalize the emancipation	792.639362953165
15475. an eyewitness recalled	how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed	in the church doorway and the diffidence the former slaves displayed	while they listened to the few words that declared them free	5649.182812380003
15476. once the question of emancipation was settled to palfrey's satisfaction	he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes	as servants	2468.259321206872
15477. palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in	the hopedale community but he had better luck in his other attempts	3036.6874696367436
15478. mrs child true to her word helped place anna and her four children	with a quaker	family named hathaway near canandaigua new york	2315.6138613048615
15479. this group had been palfrey's greatest worry since anna was	in bad health and her children were too young to work for their keep	3688.8372630693425
15480. but certainly the new frontier has brought to washington a	group more varied in background and interest	1422.3791911700387

15500. two men show promise of playing prominent	roles:   william walton a writer-turned-painter has	been a long-time friend of the president	1890.1069224061062
15501. they arrived in washington	about the same time during the early postwar years: kennedy as the	young congressman from massachusetts; walton after a wartime stint	with time-life to become bureau chief for the new republic	5662.90951159219
15502. both lived in georgetown were unattached and shared an active	social life	643.1842427592953
15503. walton who soon made a break from journalism to become	one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters vows that he	and kennedy never once discussed art in those days	4664.380241059533
15504. nonetheless they	found common interests	14.81330411653237
15505. during last year's campaign kennedy asked	walton an utter novice in organization politics to assist him	1878.0466973487037
15506. walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the	hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted	to be liaison officer to critically important new york city	3431.115107284848
15507. walton who served as a correspondent with general james gavin's	paratroopers during the invasion of france combines the soul	of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy	4659.534697846817
15508. he provoked outraged editorials	when after a post-inaugural inspection of the white house	with mrs kennedy he remarked to reporters we just cased the	joint to see what was there	3224.879208747145
15509. but his credentials are impeccable	22.236939911356806
15510. already the president and the first lady have deputized him to advise	on matters ranging from the furnishing of the white house to the	renovation of lafayette square	2993.9234932397453
15511. a man of great talent he will continue	to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter strictly ex	officio for culture	3062.2871686496937
15512. a more official representative is the secretary	of the interior	377.3233526956597
15513. udall who comes from one of the mormon	first-families of arizona is a bluff plain-spoken man with a lust	for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight	5345.1304256451895
15514. but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians he displays	a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments	1882.481164564104
15515. his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals	such as c p snow arnold toynbee and aaron copland	3293.2493081678076
15516. udall argues that interior affairs should cover a great	deal more than dams and wildlife preserves	1266.2104754912853
15517. after promoting frost's	appearance at the inauguration he persuaded the poet to return	several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet	members members of congress and other washington notables gathered	in the state department auditorium	6315.840178673904
15518. the event was so successful	that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar	ones from time to time hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment	of the administration	3458.6267451072854
15519. his ideas in this respect however	sometimes arouse critical response	561.022617043976
15520. one tempest was stirred up last	march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue	of william jennings bryan sculpted by the late gutzon borglum	would be sent on indefinite loan to salem illinois bryan's	birthplace	3858.7829622750914
15521. spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors	promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his	own hostility to this art form	3460.1693247362077
15522. they dug up a speech he had made two	years earlier as a congressman decrying the more than two hundred	statues monuments and memorials which dot the washington landscape	h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching	new plans	4340.900721721588
15523. hoping to cut down on such works udall had proposed	that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized	3506.688612958334
15524. he is not likely to win this battle easily	258.93527017889187
15525. in the	case of the borglum statue an interior aide was obliged to announce	that there had been a misunderstanding and that the secretary had no	desire to hustle it out of washington	5328.936656205846

15527. active	warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first	roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac and t	r's own living children who wish to preserve the island as	a wildlife sanctuary	6084.301255711508
15528. the hotly debated plan for the capital's franklin	d roosevelt memorial a circle of huge tablets engraved with	his speeches	is another of udall's headaches since as supervisor	of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility	for building it	4386.42468748369
15529. washington president kennedy	has been heard to remark ironically is a city of southern efficiency	and northern charm	2366.0374996833375
15530. there have been indications that he hopes	to redress that situation commencing with the white house	1251.3594390108015
15531. one of	mrs kennedy's initial concerns as first lady was the sad state	of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national	shrine	4296.742517289519
15532. ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture	assembled by president thomas jefferson the white house has collected	a hodgepodge of period pieces few of them authentic or aesthetic	3328.535902766796
15533. mrs kennedy shows a determination to change all this	389.0348814527527
15534. not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk hewed from	the timbers of the british ship hms resolute and	presented to	president hayes by queen victoria	3234.2253919506634
15535. it now serves the president	in his oval office	393.0507453771885
15536. later browsing in an old issue of the	gazette des beaux-arts she found a description of a handsome gilt	pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe	2875.2791968951356
15537. she traced	it to a storage room	141.59876047861718
15538. with its coating of gold radiator paint removed-	a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its	rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white	house	3665.8908079296534
15539. but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century	furniture	for	must be pursued in places other than government storage	rooms	3264.415730559428
15540. the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee	for the white house to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange	ways to acquire them	2733.6387362301484
15541. her effort to put the home of living presidents	on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes	no party lines	3267.5319236331134
15542. by rough estimate her committee headed by henry	francis du pont contains three times as many republicans as democrats	1723.9849448194686
15543. the press releases emanating from the white house give	a clue to the activity within	1656.4848184571777
15544. a curator has been appointed	14.784041541253714
15545. a valuable	pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of benjamin franklin by jean-honore	fragonard has been donated by the art dealer georges wildenstein	and now hangs in the blue room	4270.104339802072
15546. the american institute	of interior designers is redecorating the white house library	642.0886301992437
15547. secretary	and mrs dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire	furniture including dolley madison's own sofa to furnish a room	in that style	3477.590998614979
15548. and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware	bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs margaret	thompson biddle has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display	in the state dining room	4038.9086866674816
15549. woman's place is in the home:	man must attend to matters of the yard	1405.086380807167
15550. one of the vexatious problems	to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just	across pennsylvania avenue from the white house	2188.6695357318868
15551. congress had	already appropriated money and plans were well along to tear down the	buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one	critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings	5333.01772207741
15552. while a senator kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to	preserve the belasco theater as well as the dolley madison and the	benjamin taylor houses all scheduled for razing	3128.1563782576472
15553. what to	do about it now that he was president	560.2607041780578
15554. only a few days after moving	into the white house	376.0288439130691
15555. kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square	250.766928147086
15556. then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem	to him with instructions to work out what was best- provided it	didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the president	3339.9191956630566
15557. the situation	involved some political perils	65.65230308998385
15558. one of the offices slated for reconstruction	is the aged court of claims diagonally across the street	from the white house	2028.684063166597
15559. logically it should be moved downtown	64.91589974676012
15560. but	judge marvin jones senior member of the court is an elderly	gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk	to work	2742.909588876024
15561. more importantly he also happens to be the brother-in-law	of sam rayburn speaker of the house	1875.2231470274687
15562. there were aesthetic	problems as well as political	167.81854473575703
15563. on delving deeper walton discovered	that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified	as early nondescript	2593.0741592782106
15564. the old belasco theater over which many	people had grown sentimental was only a shell of its former self	after arduous years as a uso center	2753.289645312175
15565. the dolley madison house	walton concluded was scarcely worth preserving	557.4387918273135
15566. the attempt	to save the square's historic value he declares came half a	century too late	1266.9251805325137
15567. surrounded by ancient elms the campus is spacious and beautiful	563.2873013845929
15568. the	buildings are mostly georgian	14.859872651304382
15569. the dartmouth student does not live	in monastic seclusion as he once did	1177.3831967368699
15570. but his is still a simple life	relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go	far even though he may go fast for sophisticated pleasures	3118.41446233996
15571. he is	still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence if he chooses to be	2119.640123471682
15572. he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the	last century down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal	for book learning in his heart	3780.442535579413
15573. the men's shops on hanover's	main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven	1881.3781152333188
15574. and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend	toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke are no less rakish than	those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia	2978.689959524826
15575. but there has	always been an outdoor air to dartmouth	562.269589066804
15576. the would-be sophisticate	and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment	636.9274893584363
15577. no one	here pokes fun at manly virtues	248.94265683040922
15578. and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie	probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league	1107.527606174597
15579. it even affects	the faculty	22.340802593464765
15580. thus when dartmouth's winter carnival-	widely recognized as the greatest wildest roaringest college weekend	anywhere any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup	prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter	garb topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been	acquired from a smith girl	5027.497924571752
15581. president dickey's golden retriever	frolicking in the snow at his feet added to the picture of masculine	informality	2351.5320726486543
15582. this carefree disdain for side cropped up	again in the same television broadcast	782.196312691119
15583. dean thaddeus seymour wearing	ski clothes was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival	1652.610840205273
15584. she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown	on her head	1427.2367131993528
15585. no dartmouth man was surprised	22.05893377030542
15586. dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal	sang-froid	260.3193259113292
15587. for example groups regularly canoe down the connecticut	river	393.4862397729355
15588. this is in honor of john ledyard class of 1773 who scooped	a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in	his own student days	3330.1473611469446
15589. and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated	today	250.69261566656982
15590. they are hailed by the nation's press and smith girls throng	the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with	hot soup and kisses	2479.776074680375
15591. dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic	recreation is skiing	252.30489092943589
15592. since the days when their two thousand	pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united	states the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team	as another name for their own	3655.1038266246514
15593. yet dartmouth still is the dominant	member of the intercollegiate ski union which includes the winter	sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country	4282.703037739322
15594. dartmouth	students ski everywhere in winter starting with their own front	door	641.8294985516907
15595. they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him or move	out to oak hill where there's a lift	2832.1185859704656
15596. the dartmouth skiway	at holt's ledge ten miles north of the campus has one of the best	terrains in the east ranging from novice to expert	2735.986856533628
15597. forty	miles farther north is mount moosilauke dartmouth's own mountain	561.8801821995605
15598. here at the ravine lodge president dickey acts as host every	year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth	outing club to life on the trails	3352.945939306593
15599. the lodge built of hand-hewn	virgin spruce can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or	lounging in its huge living room	3044.227200965598
15600. the outing club also owns a chain	of fourteen cabins and several shelters extending from the vermont	hills just across the river from the college through hanover to the	college grant- 27000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in	the logging country	4469.106338146173
15601. the cabins are equipped with bunks blankets	and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips	2586.8815039980154
15602. the club runs regular trips to the cabins but many of the students	prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting	fishing climbing or skiing	3217.9387665829445
15603. under the auspices of the outing	club dartmouth also has the mountaineering club which takes	on tough climbs like mount mckinley and bait + bullet whose interests	are self-evident and even sports a woodman's team which	competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and	chopping	canoe races and the like	6221.725779411952
15604. there is much to be said for a college	that while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies still gives	its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along	back roads where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear is not	uncommon	4826.715875880362
15605. city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle	or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods	logging camp	4831.818356168065
15606. and on the summit of mount washington where thirty-five	degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered	higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom	to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas because	it is there	4824.4299584422
15607. there is much to be said for such a college-	and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too	loudly	3682.6340433443083
15608. their affection for their college home has even caused president	dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather	specially hanoverian	2190.80415820703
15609. probably a lawyer once said it best for	all time in the supreme court of the united states	2353.5679146981975
15610. early in the	nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about	for a way to found its own state university	2187.285427364432
15611. it fixed on dartmouth college	which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered	1415.4193689761792
15612. the	legislators decided to liberate dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war	with the college trustees over the control of classrooms faculty	and chapel	2334.5364705753345
15613. for a time there were two factions on the campus	fighting for possession of the student body	2120.1797717375593
15614. the struggle was	resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing	cases in our judicial history	2027.5933914805307
15615. in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating	the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters	1641.0911355172248
15616. a lawyer	hired by the college was arguing specifically for dartmouth:	daniel webster class of 1801 made her plight the dramatic focus	of his whole plea	2734.100313104601
15617. in an age of oratory he was the king of orators	and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly	tears as uncle dan'l reached his thundering climax:   it	is sir as i have said a small college and yet there are those	who love it h	7439.088511807642
15618. dartmouth is today still a small college-	and still a private one thanks to webster's eloquence	1267.5187674798221
15619. this	is not out of keeping with its origins probably the most humble of	any in the ivy group	2578.127225655138
15620. eleazar wheelock a presbyterian minister	founded the school in 1769 naming it after the second earl of dartmouth	its sponsor and benefactor	2177.9991605067235
15621. it was a hardy undertaking and wheelock's	was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness	1105.6257892951542
15622. a road had to	be	hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to	permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first	dartmouth commencement in 1771	4828.64721960716
15623. the governor and his retinue thoughtfully	brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still	one of the cherished possessions of the college	2458.384749258816
15624. the exuberance	on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings	961.3009998857045
15625. a student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned	even before the punch was served	1582.0949368764784
15626. then from the branches of a	near-by tree an indian underclassman disdaining both the platform and	the english language harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue	4099.686322781293
15627. governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green	beneath the three-hundred-foot pines and a barrel of rum was broached	2190.6147925870837
15628. the cook got drunk and president wheelock proved to be a man	of broad talents by carving the ox himself	2818.2461967713816
15629. future commencements	were more decorous perhaps but the number of graduates increased	from the original four at a relatively slow pace	2032.692139573539
15630. by the end of the	nineteenth	century in 1893 when the big three columbia and penn	were populous centers of learning dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine	3902.937535781395
15631. the dormitories including the beloved dartmouth hall could barely	house two hundred students in spartan fashion	1261.9662982710688
15632. then in 1893	dr william jewett tucker became president and the college's	great awakening began	1655.34169515336
15633. he transformed dartmouth from a small new	hampshire institution into a national college	795.3083780107498
15634. by 1907 the number of	undergraduates had risen to 1107	557.5299341132358
15635. and at his last commencement in	that year dr tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence	of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the	college	3104.644966246694
15636. the presidents of cornell wisconsin ccny	bowdoin vermont brown columbia princeton yale and harvard	and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there	3673.953191970625
15637. dartmouth is numerically still a small college today with approximately	twenty-nine hundred undergraduates	786.2382037094038
15638. but it has achieved a	cross-section of students from almost all the states and two-thirds of	its undergraduates come from outside new england	3482.9961139504985
15639. over 450 different	schools are usually represented in each entering class	499.44068605419636
15640. only a dozen	or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more	than fifteen men in any single delegation	3695.9539004502562
15641. about two-thirds of the	boys now come from public schools	379.3531928134113
15642. it is still a college only	and not a university; it is in fact the only college in the ivy	group	3077.134598724587
15643. however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer	professional curriculums- the dartmouth medical school	the thayer school of engineering	and the amos tuck school of business administration	2748.8055699688603
15644. all	three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of	about two hundred	1642.2849437868244
15645. all three schools coordinate their educational	programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college	proper	place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation	for specialized study	3562.9705413007587
15646. students of the college who are candidates	for the ab degree and can satisfy the academic requirements	of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated	schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the	two-year postgraduate course in one year	6944.384892535207
15647. the thayer school offers	a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy wins	a bs in engineering	2179.8961500405103
15648. so dartmouth is moving closer	to the others in the ivy group	965.3411850079301
15649. it is still however the junior member	of the league if not in years at least in the catching up it has	had to do	2599.7558379726056
15650. it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span	the other ivies have enjoyed	2355.496237131341
15651. however much football has been over-emphasized	the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by	the scoreboard so while yale need never give its record a thought again	since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 dartmouth	had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national	recognition	5142.655958757285
15652. it has come on with a rush in more significant areas	751.6002125113562
15653. today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions	might consider somewhat breathtaking	1098.9575197811769
15654. but dartmouth preserves	its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes and although	some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage they	make for lively copy	4638.712830311064
15655. president emeritus hopkins once proposed	to corral an aristocracy of brains in hanover	788.687616635881
15656. the person who left the buggy there has never been identified	754.2451878382908
15657. it was	a busy street conveniently near the shopping center and unattended	horses and wagons were often left at the curbside	2037.4273353832573
15658. there are	of course many weaknesses in any case against emma	745.9908376059886
15659. she didn't like	her stepmother but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before	the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage	2456.896647629347
15660. she had no	way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed	1413.1749419564958
15661. she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized	during her travels	1571.8431956763459
15662. if she avoided the train and hired a buggy	the stableman might have recognized her	1643.677622275678
15663. if police had checked on	her more thoroughly than is indicated she would be completely eliminated	as a suspect	1733.3075031180338
15664. uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate	popular suspect	389.65970564204633
15665. his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden	home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him	although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer	3430.2896725945125
15666. lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were	in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been	disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was	a very hot day	6449.342444460215
15667. it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything	she overheard between her father and her uncle morse	1558.3653784930843
15668. at that	time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s phillips	1188.0291623104454
15669. a few years ago not too long before his death phillips revealed	in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders	2585.624123583455
15670. he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that	day information which must have come from lizzie	2827.515083907788
15671. it was obviously	the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door	1094.0972316827715
15672. the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton	as saying long after the trial that if he only knew what borden said	during his conversation with morse he would have convicted somebody	5002.121046795133
15673. notice knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a	conviction in the trial of lizzie borden	1577.4865571246517
15674. he said he would have convicted	somebody	140.32495621153762
15675. it is known that morse did associate with	a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at	westport a town not far from fall river	2845.4168241040284
15676. they were a vagabond lot	and considered to be shady and undesirable characters	1177.8135819118647
15677. fall river police	did go to westport to see if they could get any information against	morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from	among these men	3330.368989000713
15678. these officers found no incriminating information	64.97485826139516
15679. morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed	262.3339723604558
15680. he said he	returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar	1414.5663658255087
15681. the woman	in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said	she left when he did to shop for her dinner	2717.1445173318725
15682. fall river is not a	fashionable town	141.1025986569419
15683. the dinner hour there was twelve noon	92.92165012929209
15684. if this woman	had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping she would have	had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was	eaten at dinner in those days	5302.831473023496
15685. it is possible that morse told the woman	it was 11:20 but it could have been earlier since she did serve	dinner on time	2438.6480814949537
15686. police did make an attempt to check on morse's alibi	564.9474275631001
15687. they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he	had taken but the man did not remember morse as a passenger	2172.285446765069
15688. questioned	further morse said that there had been four or five priests riding	on the same car with him	2600.22644832824
15689. the conductor did recall having priests	as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also	pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests	riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so morse's statement	really proved nothing	4301.76349238573
15690. we do know that morse left the house	before nine o'clock	749.3286681600855
15691. bridget testified she saw him leave through the	side door	373.18201444964586
15692. morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door	753.5401469306654
15693. from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked	leisurely to where his niece was staying more than a mile away	2870.5232560825625
15694. he met nobody he knew on this walk	249.6942677575254
15695. there is no accounting of his movements	in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs	borden was killed	2307.2313784981793
15696. morse testified that while he was having	breakfast in the dining room mrs borden told the servant bridget	i want you to wash these windows today	4098.018711574903
15697. bridget's testimony	was in direct contradiction	43.35379685560686
15698. she said it was after she returned	from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs borden told	her to wash the windows	3676.6890542211722
15699. this was long after morse had left the house	262.92382512096975
15700. morse's knowledge of what mrs borden told bridget could	indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden	there	3259.98116125177
15701. he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous	visits during the past three or four months alone	2183.032702325675
15702. and despite knowlton's	attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than	a drum this was not true	2804.5117761165397
15703. the screen door was unlocked for some ten	or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back	1575.7823247976976
15704. it was unlocked	all the time she was washing windows	562.2113783316668
15705. morse could have returned	openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room	he had occupied	2182.79329168211
15706. mrs borden would not have been alarmed if she	saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand	2582.3677923336154
15707. he had been to the farm	the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet	at the farm	2330.3656576334056
15708. mrs borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him	and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she	could cry out	4089.357645770061
15709. he could have left for weybosset street after her	murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar	2039.2807934495675
15710. if	he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return he could	have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr borden came	home	4097.935741173148
15711. with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget	upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to	the house	2883.6756761161832
15712. with the second murder over he could have left hidden the	weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood	3515.4282428112665
15713. his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree	with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding	the side door was odd	3215.097757492748
15714. there was no close examination of his	clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of	them	2592.4373482989654
15715. and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing	a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed	2709.999008019786
15716. the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was	no financial gain for morse in the murders	2345.9623896807916
15717. on the other side	of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with	whom she was staying	2466.3751846871896
15718. the time would have been shortly after the	murder of mrs borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior	2813.4048752881777
15719. he said he had promised mrs borden to return in time for dinner	and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden	house	3086.1615593958677
15720. what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible	suspect in his trial-book essay	1650.5694154602618
15721. he wrote:   the	police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr morse as in	possession of guilty knowledge	1880.6638899432903
15722. neither had any interest in the deaths;	indeed it was probably to mr morse's advantage to have	mr and mrs borden alive	3266.8443114578613
15723. both he and bridget were exonerated	by lizzie herself	259.8931605243461
15724. that was his complete discussion of bridget	sullivan as a possible suspect	966.2362384912328
15725. although pearson disbelieved	almost everything lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost	everything she did he happily accepted her statement about bridget	as the whole truth	2980.617097808811
15726. he felt nothing further need be said about the	servant girl	757.5492205251228
15727. the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration	but lizzie's expression of her opinion as reported in the	testimony of assistant marshal fleet	2460.680603349383
15728. this officer had asked lizzie	if she suspected her uncle morse and she replied she didn't	think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned	after them	5158.651180984998
15729. fleet asked the same question about bridget and lizzie	pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her	room	before her father's murder and came down when she called her	3757.7352197321766
15730. lizzie actually never named any suspect	64.8338657848647
15731. she told police about	the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some	weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of	town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner	4286.755643252288
15732. and much as she detested hiram harrington she also did not	accuse him	1185.9684069158989
15733. at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew	anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings	toward	her father	2593.315797853472
15734. she replied i know of one man that has not been	friendly with him	1411.5228678283745
15735. they have not been friendly for years	94.23806884528298
15736. asked	who this was she named harrington	140.91361532607326
15737. her statement certainly was true;	the press reported the same facts in using harrington's interview	but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the	killer	2984.0562300253423
15738. when i interviewed kirby who as a boy picked up pears	in the borden yard i asked if anybody else in the household besides	lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the	murders	6060.571145868711
15739. he said he had not heard of anybody else	260.54133996937855
15740. how about bridget	sullivan	4.418320676565615
15741. i inquired	0.20041515
15742. oh she was just the maid there	he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant	she was	2585.203503308244
15743. kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed	at the time of the murders	1101.7885528545878
15744. everyone somehow manages to overlook	completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two	people in and about the house at the time of both murders: lizzie	borden and bridget sullivan	5635.175202555639
15745. all the officials on the case	seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was	concerned although records in police files contain many reports of	servants who have murdered their employers	3861.6657994136976
15746. true it is no longer cricket	for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing	here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters	and situations	5320.797090365422
15747. the actions of bridget should be examined	since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her	innocence	2024.0101561452914
15748. there are also other factors that require closer examination	391.9733358736309
15749. the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes	the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the	trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping	her mouth shut	3938.5127006138055
15750. the people who believe and retell the legend have	apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know	that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to	the detriment of lizzie	5939.880776014574
15751. if bridget did get any bundles of cash	the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would	have been lizzie borden	2450.692693873573
15752. bridget was born in ireland one	of fourteen children	393.20142086014715
15753. she was apparently the pioneer in her family because	she had no close relatives in this country at that time	1869.917899131876
15754. she worked	as a domestic first in newport for a year and then in south	bethlehem pennsylvania for another year	2822.770592608252
15755. she finally settled in fall	river and after being employed for a time by a mrs reed was	hired by the bordens	2176.057492749776
15756. i have previously described how during	the week of the murder bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing	and ironing clothes	3290.45869503703
15757. her father james upton was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in	the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who	came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor	of the port	4232.455052786235
15758. a gentleman of the old school mr upton possessed	intellectual power ample means and withal was a devoted christian	2593.1267944484193
15759. the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical	subjects	504.7533247562675
15760. her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad	interests	963.225210846862
15761. there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood	had an unusual mind	643.834675556284
15762. she possessed an observant eye a retentive memory	and a critical faculty	972.4520500890745
15763. when she was nine years old she wrote	a description of a store she had visited	1260.7419109397288
15764. she named 48 items and said	there were many more things which it would take too long to write	2574.205608015626
15765. an essay on freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the	declaration of independence the freedom given to slaves in canada	and the views of george washington	2991.1348869711037
15766. lucy upton was graduated	from the salem high school when few colleges only oberlin and	elmira were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning	that could not be denied	5181.447499875069
15767. a picture of her in high school comes	from a younger schoolmate albert s flint friend of her brother	winslow and later like winslow a noted astronomer	2864.7309266828142
15768. he recalled	lucy as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly	through the boys' study hall to join the class in greek in the little	recitation room beyond	4665.80519380442
15769. the study of greek was the distinctive	mark of boys destined to go to college and lucy upton too expected	to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men	3558.583453339066
15770. the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this	389.43596430776586
15771. with four younger	children at home lucy stepped into her mother's role and even after	the brothers and sisters were grown she was her father's comfort	and stay until he died in 1879	3554.942231328474
15772. but even so lucy could not give up	her intellectual pursuits	748.733571163105
15773. when her brother winslow became a student	at brown university in 1874 she wrote him about a course in history	he was taking under professor diman: what is prof diman's	definition of civilization and take the world through is its progress	ever onward or does it retrograde at times	4892.410651072422
15774. do you think i	might profitably study some of the history you do perhaps two weeks	behind you h	2601.650794994718
15775. and that she proceeded to do	43.394530140649394
15776. many years later	lucy upton wrote winslow's daughter soon	to be graduated from smith college: while i love botany which	after dabbling in for years i studied according to the methods	of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating	to take up zoology in the way you are doing	7955.044487237539
15777. whatever was the	science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite	study	1571.3305572850982
15778. her study of history	was persistently pursued	139.5845687812463
15779. she read maitland's dark ages which	i enjoyed very much; la croix on the customs of the middle	ages; 16 chapters of bryce and liked it more and more;	more chapters of guizot; lecky and stanley's eastern church	4050.6868314153753
15780. she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions	that came to her as she studied alone	2591.6389741302823
15781. lucy's correspondence	with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken	up with academic studies	1406.2478267624833
15782. she played chess with him by postcard	141.32758274030397
15783. also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could	make the most words from the letters in importunately	2201.25059526912
15784. who won	is not revealed but winslow's daughter eleanor says they got up to	1212 words	1887.9391345453114
15785. there was another family interest also	43.71888712891705
15786. winslow	had musical talents as had his father before him	564.4541653986854
15787. at different times	he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist	793.3134544046411
15788. and it was	lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music	at spelman college	2574.6739484898203
15789. winslow upton after graduation from brown	university and two years of graduate study accepted a position	at the harvard observatory	1893.7229573814147
15790. for three years he was connected with	the us naval observatory and with the us signal corps;	and after 1883 was professor of astronomy at brown university	4289.859436698442
15791. the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun of which he was	a member took him to colorado virginia and california as well as	to the south pacific and to russia	3461.432010757776
15792. after her father's death lucy	and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington	dc	2578.690525081787
15793. their house writes albert s flint	was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful	to one like myself far from home	2477.2189779037385
15794. lucy was a lively part of the	household	251.1949164469751
15795. moreover she had physical as well as mental vigor	263.98449566601124
15796. winslow	as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall used to characterize	her as our iron sister	1885.013563387669
15797. there is reason to suppose that lucy	would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother	had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about	to enter college	3760.149317626575
15798. as a matter of fact albert s flint expressed	his conviction that her physical strength her mental power her	lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve	her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career	amongst the noted women of this country	7299.354941583822
15799. while in washington	dc lucy upton held positions in the us census	office and in the pension bureau	1567.825383511736
15800. they were not sufficiently challenging	however and she resigned in 1887 to go to germany with her	brother winslow and his family while he was there on study	4446.148896787008
15801. after the	months in europe she returned to boston and became active in church	and community life	1408.1589972898923
15802. what was called an accidental meeting	with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman	1867.477249299101
15803. here was a cause she believed in	93.68907756284311
15804. after correspondence with miss	packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles she came	to atlanta in the fall of 1888 to help wherever needed although	there was then no money available to pay her a salary	6277.897483227573
15805. she served for	a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance	938.2497675798625
15806. her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship	and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students;	of her great power of discernment; of her exquisiteness	of dress her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts	of the hearers; her great love of flowers and plants and birds;	and her close knowledge of individual students	8336.953270703994
15807. she drew	on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them	at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall she drew on	her purse as well	3533.3748889166736
15808. many a student was able to remain at spelman only	because of her unobtrusive help	1631.9828830139459
15809. under miss upton the work	of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption	787.6980684716207
15810. after all	she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 and had been since 1891 except	for one year associate principal or dean	3492.827742608649
15811. she had taught classes	in botany astronomy geometry	and	psychology	377.159152338082
15812. miss upton and miss packard as a matter of fact	had many tastes in common	1648.1522888486384
15813. both had eager and inquiring minds; and	both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the	development of sturdy character and christian zeal	2726.9670050598024
15814. both loved the	out-of-doors including mountain climbing and horseback riding	565.3210977136265
15815. in 1890	when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss	packard it was miss upton who planned the trip and with rare	executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from	beginning to end	4219.061972456119
15816. so strenuous it was physically with its days of	horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance	for both miss packard and miss upton	4629.966144886206
15817. yet they thrived on	it	14.779228400542317
15818. at the fifteenth	anniversary as already quoted miss	upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future	as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons	4861.993629148059
15819. when dr wallace buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined	to have the science building named for him he wrote miss tapley	h if you had asked me i think i would have	suggested that you name the building for miss upton	4464.339900268892
15820. her services	to the school for many years were of a very high character and i	have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her	4654.994336999514
15821. such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary	after the death of miss giles	1250.5618870858912
15822. at the meeting of the	board of trustees on march 3 1910 miss upton presented the annual	report of the president	3043.221499088596
15823. she noted that no student had been withdrawn	through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase	of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work	had gone forward smoothly	3562.774672113285
15824. she urged the importance of more thorough	preparation for admission	562.8123693987543
15825. the raising of the $25000 improvement	fund two days before the time limit expired and the spontaneous praise	demonstration held afterward on the campus were reported as	events which had brought happiness to miss giles	3758.987391211117
15826. with the fund in	hand the debt on the boilers had been paid; rockefeller and packard	halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken	for the superintendent's home	5003.342518550327
15827. miss upton spoke gratefully of	the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise	the fund and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly	needed current expenses	3334.9086004711753
15828. she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the	many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the	years had made the work so fruitful in results	4326.666038383624
15829. two bequests	were recorded: one of $200 under the will of mrs harriet a	copp of los angeles; and one of $2000 under the will of miss celia	l brett of hamilton new york a friend from the early days	4213.3744102700675
15830. miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles	was the sorest grief the seminary had ever been called upon	to bear	3671.003918125476
15831. the daughters of spelman she said had never known or thought	of spelman without her	1091.9741514458087
15832. the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier	had caused them great sorrow but they still had miss giles	2578.7415713085124
15833. now the school was indeed bereft	43.311721564921164
15834. yet spelman has strong deep roots	and will live for the blessing of generations to come	1873.9092804372085
15835. miss mary jane packard sophia's half-sister became ill in	march 1910; and when school closed she was unable to travel to massachusetts	2161.582477853474
15836. she remained in atlanta through june and july; she	died on august sixth	1190.1730634001412
15837. before coming on a visit to spelman	in 1885 miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester and	her position there was held open for her for a considerable period	3325.3588280584822
15838. but	she decided to stay at spelman	139.8994216899712
15839. she helped with teaching as well	as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes	in geography rhetoric and bookkeeping	2615.3145360649064
15840. soon the office work claimed	all her time	248.1278975368071
15841. she was closely associated with the founders in all	their trials and hardships	786.2690164644905
15842. quiet and energetic cheerful and calm	she too was a power in the development of the seminary	2119.01893805057
15843. miss giles	always used to refer to her as sister	373.73225254649395
15844. she served as secretary	in the seminary office for 25 years and was in charge of correspondence	records and bookkeeping	2822.432372039543
15845. the books of the school hold a memorial	to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers	1887.3865924120996
15846. mary j packard states a messenger editorial was efficient	pains-taking self-effacing loving radiating the spirit of her	master	2361.723648377731
15847. with infinite patience she responded to every call no matter	at what cost to herself and to her all went for she was sure to	have the needed information or word of cheer	3539.5160663385004
15848. in a few school districts one finds a link between school and	job	1181.3567498481166
15849. in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money	there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer	on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other	3565.3214095071407
15850. in these cases	a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program saving	a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12	3907.7962005441987
15851. the apprentice	program will involve further education on a part-time basis usually	at night perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high	school	2603.1586131856343
15852. these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such	crafts as auto mechanics carpentry drafting electrical work tool-and-die	work and sheet-metal work	3722.7663008109676
15853. formally organized vocational	programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to	gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time	job on graduation	3335.229962493515
15854. the diversified occupations program is a	part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on	a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business	employers	4311.198922286193
15855. the distributive education program operates in	a similar way with arrangements between the school and employers in	merchandising	fields	1724.154597167989
15856. in both cases the student attends school half-time	and works in a regular job the other half	2121.9543686061756
15857. he receives remuneration	for his work	43.58890709577055
15858. in a few places cooperative programs between schools	and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing	the student while still in school to develop skills which are	immediately marketable upon graduation	5625.481158872968
15859. adult education courses	work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of	a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities	for out-of-school youth	2712.7717522427183
15860. in general however it may be said	that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities	play little or no part in the decision of what happens next	5311.201893904892
15861. if the	student drops out of high school the break with the school is even	more complete	1415.4356141898552
15862. when there is employment opportunity for youth this	arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well	2096.305164727951
15863. indeed	in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities	have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were	potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and	went to work	4293.801365885067
15864. statistically this has represented a loss to the nation	although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in	retrospect may have been a wise one	4479.7311266769
15865. i make no attempt to measure the	enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work	on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business	which he entered	3677.6426215453625
15866. he may or may not be better off than his	classmate who went on to a college and professional school	2811.1174306487815
15867. but in	the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all	the potential professional talent	1577.1059251401862
15868. in a later chapter dealing	with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arranging	a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any	high school where he is found	5483.986713427363
15869. in the negro neighborhoods and also	to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of	identification and motivation	2184.2169888704384
15870. high motivation towards higher education	must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches	grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are	essential for academic work	5934.357876950622
15871. undoubtedly far more can be done in the	lower grades in this regard in the negro schools	1418.5272930503918
15872. however the teacher	can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family	is anti-intellectual	2612.5728034365084
15873. and the fact remains that there are today few	shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership	1558.5390411564538
15874. this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern	universities	1874.8270456388564
15875. quite the contrary as i can testify from personal	experience as a former university president	1108.1695904951107
15876. rather we see here	another vicious circle	140.42487837280925
15877. the absence of successful negroes in the world	of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among	negro youth for academic careers	2455.6447832482504
15878. i believe the situation is improving	but the success stories need to be heavily publicized	1638.9019368142733
15879. here again	we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated	as negroes in the press	1891.0491924884252
15880. how can the vicious circle be broken	140.45975231310416
15881. this	is a problem to which leaders of opinion both negro and white	should devote far more attention	1578.1567905117315
15882. it is at least as important as the	more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south	2828.021549416316
15883. i should like to underline four points	i made in my first report with respect to vocational education	1567.7404394895057
15884. first	and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which	are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation	2830.4361181814984
15885. second	vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and	not require more than half the student's time in those years; however	for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to	begin earlier	3859.2826618563768
15886. third the significance of the vocational courses is	that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize	the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers and this	sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they	are studying at the same time	7403.528491964285
15887. fourth the type of vocational training	programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the	general locality	1567.8055434531284
15888. this last point is important because if high school	pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain	vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training	the whole idea of relevance disappears	6335.25447835139
15889. vocational training which	holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable	skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest	in their studies has begun to falter	3551.130974303755
15890. those who because of population	mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees	would limit vocational education to general rather than specific	skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind	of school experience	6534.052817281436
15891. i have been using the word vocational	as a layman would at first sight think it should be used	1743.6278503915923
15892. i intend	to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys	and girls	1896.5781395426936
15893. these courses develop skills other than those we think of	when we use the adjective academic	1252.1487146043748
15894. practically all of these practical	skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained	in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at	once on the basis of the skill	6202.482839218477
15895. they are in this sense skills marketable	immediately on graduation from high school	792.1980062100645
15896. to be sure in tool-and-die	work and in the building trades the first job must be often	on an apprentice basis but two years of half-time vocational training	enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status	6345.552315983177
15897. similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography	and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job	at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two	of further study in a community college or secretarial school	5019.062767980952
15898. of course	it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and	with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill	3484.5628781513783
15899. so too is the	mathematical	competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics	1101.54790704975
15900. in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be	considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student	in his vocation will be called upon to use	some of the skills developed and the competence obtained	6566.23218682185
15901. in spite	of the shading of one type of course into another i believe it is useful	to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses	2876.711508628342
15902. perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which	proves the rule	1654.1251462989057
15903. today many college bound students try to take a	course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of	this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work	in college and a professional school	4313.166855045802
15904. most of our largest	cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools	1670.6297485116968
15905. in this respect public education in the large cities differs from education	in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts	1881.910790675298
15906. the	neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools	because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational	or technical high school instead of the local school	5014.608929354542
15907. indeed one	school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term	comprehensive	high school for the senior high schools in his city because	these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs	3761.131395149639
15908. he prefers	to designate such schools as general high schools	566.0457964948497
15909. the suburban	high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive	high school because of the absence of vocational programs	2313.160920866298
15910. the reason	is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community	1874.3266813485175
15911. therefore	employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan	area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic	of the comprehensive high school described in my first report	3442.4066912957737
15912. the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities	must be reckoned as permanent institutions	2121.974525469413
15913. by and large their programs	are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and	to the realities of the apprentice system	2031.4152074126844
15914. it is not often realized	to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of	employment except for a lucky few	3482.663382684771
15915. one has to talk confidentially with	some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a	boy cannot just say i want to be a plumber and then by doing	good work find a job	3950.0259282721263
15916. it is far more difficult in many communities	to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval	than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation	5011.553969268893
15917. two stories will illustrate what i have in mind	261.78938252680507
15918. one vocational instructor	in a city vocational school speaking of his course in a certain	field said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside	of the city	4825.219956824882
15919. in the city he said the waiting list for those	who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside	track he can't get in	3324.625433945906
15920. in a far distant part of the united states	i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade	was doing special work	4287.57473497507
15921. what does he have in mind to do when he	graduates	503.2399185043517
15922. oh he'll be a plumber came the answer	252.33773991995068
15923. but	isn't it almost impossible to get into the union	374.5813917509326
15924. i asked	0.30041514999999996
15925. he'll have no difficulty i was told	92.83943712799399
15926. he has very good	connections	22.18411061819603
15927. in my view there should be a school which offers	significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every	family in a city	2460.453581931264
15928. ideally these schools should be so located that	one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is	at the highest	3910.188258403404
15929. an excellent example of a successful location	of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school	in chicago	2031.049987399479
15930. located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment	this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational	aims of its students	3695.048241261079
15931. hardly a window has been broken since	dunbar	first was opened		260.1643567366834
15932. i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost	all the pupils were negroes	1873.2637630431059
15933. they were learning trades as diverse	as shoe repairing bricklaying carpentry cabinet making auto mechanics	and airplane mechanics	1580.250015432091

16101. though	the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results many	men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle	horn supplemented sometimes in the case of cattle by a downward heave	of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail	4460.8008506956885
16102. such tactics were	resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns and a thorough	tailin' usually knocked the breath out of a steer and so dazed	'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day	5626.391720731008

16128. this led to the famous sayin' in the northwest of the	books won't freeze	1410.6548223853647
16129. this became a common byword durin' the	boom days when eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle	interests	2021.0932096980528
16130. the origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper	by the name of luke murrin	1874.80580703536

16137. again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler	and when the order was given to go out and rustle the hosses	it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in	3762.820153430249
16138. eventually herdin'	the hosses was spoken of as hoss rustlin' and the wrangler was	called the hoss rustler	2366.0059646056634

16141. he found them near the carcass	of a zebra that had been killed the night before and he circled	once nose to the ground hair shooting up along his back as it did	when he was after lion or bear and then he lifted his head and bayed	and the pack joined in all heads high and jones knew it was a hot	trail	5719.19841920872
16142. he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him	straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain	2130.9033052166824
16143. this mountain was	known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about	two hundred feet honeycombed with caves top covered with dense scrub	and creepers and tall grass	3333.4180978349855
16144. on the south it ended sharply as though	the lava had been cut off there suddenly	1879.25208421606
16145. kearton and ulyate	had started the day together while jones followed the dogs and means	and loveless had taken another route and now with the discovery	of the fresh trail still unknown to him ulyate reined in in the	shadow of the reef and pointed	4617.541487889807
16146. kearton focussed his field glasses	22.34517733363331
16147. that's the colonel he said but i can't see the	dogs	503.60143154753257
16148. as they watched jones rode straight for the reef	394.8311055244074
16149. then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front	of him	1100.5672614173518
16150. the dogs were working a trail- lion	140.97837774191845
16151. hyena	0.20041515
16152. the pack	had made a bend to the north swinging back toward the reef and kearton	and ulyate could hear them faintly	3282.2106539424663
16153. kearton got off and	tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled	it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless	and means and the rest of the party	4297.471500957436
16154. jones came toward them fast now along the southern	toe of the reef and the dogs could be heard plainly old john	with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others	5003.669327937171
16155. there	was sounder too also a veteran of the north rim and rastus and	the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds and a collie from a london	pound and simba a terrier h	3686.1192225057857
16156. a motley pack chosen for effectiveness	not beauty	249.8524813852011
16157. jones was galloping close behind them leaning	down cheering them on	502.12004558062324
16158. light it! ulyate said and kearton	touched a match to the pile of grass blew on it and flame licked	out	3037.888398728281
16159. he threw green stuff on it and a thin blue column of smoke rose	941.3386739030769
16160. that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we	are	966.483227340574
16161. then there was a chorus of	wild barking and baying	372.7874973334552
16162. then the heavy roar of a lion	140.11653022879133
16163. kearton	and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound	946.9437607700551
16164. it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away	1179.8649597437056
16165. at the	base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot	1097.3478639342852
16166. the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks creepers and bushes so	thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called	ulyate answered from ten feet away	4475.641039743956
16167. nice country to meet a lion in	face to face	375.0754163080009
16168. ulyate drew back with a start and put	finger to lips almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her	off the dogs have got her bayed h	3109.6795779387194
16169. she's just the other side	of that bush! and when they had drawn back a step he added:	jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her	4662.732465108113
16170. why she doesn't	charge him i don't know	167.40207295630518
16171. and he hasn't even got a knife on	him	397.56592871098803
16172. he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground h	637.8463936607745
16173. jones had been about a hundred	and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the	reef	3265.7539970486187
16174. she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when	she saw him she rose to full height and roared opening her mouth wide	lashing her tail and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in	irritation as much as to say: how dare you disturb me in my sacred	precinct	5194.488609266222
16175. intuition told him however that she was tired	and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge yet	3038.369585708107
16176. he	moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because	he knew the female is less predictable than the male	2179.3899644878393
16177. at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game	hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso	3279.3153342464348
16178. of the thirty-four seventeen had been killed by lions and eleven out	she snarled terribly but intuition	told	him again that she was bluffing and he could see that half her	attention was distracted by the dogs	3925.131110949443
16179. it was falling	over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front	of her on the rock	3689.794377791963
16180. even then if she took one step forward he could	catch her	645.1403801970482
16181. but john nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end	was as good as another to john africa arizona no matter- and she	changed ends and took a swipe at john but he ducked back	5632.029319558831
16182. jones	then recoiled his rope and threw again this time hitting her on	the back but failing to encircle her	1873.72026439487
16183. she whirled and faced him roaring	terribly and ulyate watching through the leaves could not understand	why she did not charge and obliterate him because he wouldn't	have much of a chance of getting away in that thick growth but she	seemed just a trace uncertain; while jones on the other hand appeared	perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer	8457.507457200696
16184. from the lioness' point of view this strange creature	on the back of another creature lashing out with its long thin paw	very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with	3637.8566152540334
16185. but	now she sank lower to the rock	252.11690143526144
16186. her roar changed to a growl	43.5490811798554
16187. her	tail	no longer lashed	22.281830787489262
16188. although she appeared more subdued and defeated	jones knew she was growing more dangerous	945.4662572181733
16189. she was rested and could	mount a charge	251.4946547522091
16190. just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched	and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet	2312.4018677514437
16191. at this moment loveless and means arrived crashing through the undergrowth	with their horses and distracted her and she ran off a short	distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks	5190.73655553429
16192. the dogs followed	her and she killed three and badly wounded old john	789.6305551331078
16193. we've	got to get her out of there! jones yelled or she'll	kill 'em all	1640.4477456437082
16194. for such an	emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of	their equipment	1094.1305038846465
16195. lighting one he pitched it into the crevice and the	lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed	2377.9166673741283
16196. ain't she	a beauty though	14.892676709661245
16197. called out means as she ran	65.85924714273034
16198. don't	you go a step nearer her than i do jones warned and if	you do go at a run so you'll have momentum!   for two hours	they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of	the reef trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get	a good throw	5329.353782690027
16199. but she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore	away	1189.158039007261
16200. the dogs were tired	2.9319317463659496
16201. the men were tired too	22.145546321615434
16202. it	was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again	498.92120851915314
16203. and the sun was	beginning to go down	252.14146308825138
16204. if dark came they would lose her	93.68255110208074
16205. i'll	get a pole jones said finally and i'll poke a noose	over her	head!   at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like	aperture halfway down the reef	4658.561492474337
16206. ulyate made no comment but his face	showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles	and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago not the gentler	ones of today and this one was angry with good reason	4538.570010012888
16207. it won't work colonel	4.419614151200369
16208. just the	same we'll try it	43.06901902576668
16209. but without waiting for them to try it	she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain	3262.042468983501
16210. john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out	behind many of them trailing blood	1565.9456803243343
16211. john himself was bruised and	clawed from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running	almost as strongly now as in the morning	4470.396767198224
16212. she took refuge	on a tongue of land extending into a gully crouched at the base of a	thorn tree and waited for them to come up	2873.4217587408216
16213. she had chosen the spot well	65.00074433048837
16214. with the gully on three sides she could be approached only along	the tongue of land	1259.1812809732096
16215. means	tried her first	4.430016227027195
16216. very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding	edging closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to spin and	run rope whining about his head horse edging tensely under him but	the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close	proximity of the lion	4948.18140427334
16217. they tell you horses go crazy at the sight	or smell of a bear or a lion but these didn't	2846.1716689023106
16218. she snarled warningly	0.20041515
16219. means spit and edged on	22.23269938189326
16220. again she	snarled and again he edged	93.96388162437145
16221. the pony was sidewise to her	64.92278140516953
16222. with a whirling	jump it could get into gear h	375.89389823176873
16223. however nothing on four legs	was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless	it was a cheetah	3256.46425409545
16224. for thirty	yards she gained rapidly	43.39630096166043
16225. she was closing and within one more bound	would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay but- and	here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they	were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound	6797.03621016102
16226. means held	steady one jump ahead of her	167.00839857555042
16227. then gradually he began to pull away	139.5687936975766
16228. a western cowpony had outrun an african lion from a standing start	648.5216642675467
16229. photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from means h	964.921255630443
16230. of course the factor of head start made all the difference	503.836974889624
16231. how much	head start	4.457393983481802
16232. no one knew exactly	2.957104106664498
16233. that was the whole question	22.199017437312314
16234. the lioness quickly changed front when	she saw she couldn't catch means and made for jones	1263.982691791849
16235. as she had	done with means she gained rapidly at first but then baldy began	to draw away	2356.841424169133
16236. somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the	determining point	785.3163899949789
16237. when jones too drew away she returned to	a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully crouched low	and waited as before	4109.9763476701355
16238. this new position however gave the ropers a	better chance	372.18862810120714
16239. there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and	throw as you went	1897.65265896566
16240. so: means edged around on the north side of her	jones moved in from the south	1260.375090102495
16241. tossing his rope and shouting he attracted	her attention	391.44020103041373
16242. he succeeded almost too well because once she	rose as if to charge and he half wheeled his horse- he was within	fifty feet- but she sank back	2994.8927259607713
16243. from behind her means shot	forward at a run	393.90276108482874
16244. kearton began shouting wait wait- the camera's	jammed! but means kept on	642.990304370235
16245. he raced by within twenty feet	of her roped her around the neck but a lioness' neck is short and	thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off	5027.920665602006
16246. the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was	once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies	1873.3656211658406
16247. but the time	came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was	looked upon as deficient in its essential life	3694.351964008211
16248. the christian education	of children too was once hardly more than a sideshow but the day	came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church	school was thought of as failing in its duty	4028.372627020371
16249. the most serious	weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally	regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination	and a few interdenominational executives	4998.614115584256
16250. most pastors and laymen	even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical	movement lies outside the province of their parishes	2447.814728838538
16251. they may	even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the	ecclesiastical rover boys as someone has dubbed them who like	to go to national and international assemblies and have expense accounts	that permit them to do so	6472.443798526996
16252. as long as this point of view	prevails the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt	1256.1035504861215
16253. the next	stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community	1867.8182157999047
16254. progress will take place far less through what is done in any	summit conference of the national council or the world council	or even in offices of the denominational boards than through what	happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors	4550.660262803785
16255. the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping	congregations of different traditions exist side by side	2357.73359224469
16256. until they	see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their	own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable	aspect of unreality	2968.793374781907
16257. as things now stand there is a grievous disparity	between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings	and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main	street in the nation	5468.634528156808
16258. the crux	of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation	between congregations in the same community	1887.70512407274
16259. the decisive question	is what happens within each congregation and finally in the	minds and hearts of the individual members	2823.3633988659294
16260. it is here that the local	and ecumenical must meet	373.696802662077
16261. it is here that the ecumenical must become	local and the local become ecumenical	1404.5932714967307
16262. it has become almost	trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the	grass roots	1715.5298354525644
16263. this way of describing the matter is unfortunate	252.52007241028133
16264. one is that whatever is ecumenical has	to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only	to be understood at the so-called lower levels	2875.776974260615
16265. the truth however	is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its	own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god	throughout the world	5046.839124855769
16266. the other misconception is that our ecumenical	problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide	extension and its interdenominational connections now comprehended	by many national leaders can be communicated to all congregations	4047.989019643765
16267. however needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information	but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ	in the world	4089.601155867159
16268. the basic unit in the church of whatever denominational	polity is always the congregation	948.954493327562
16269. it is hardly possible	to emphasize this too much	389.09337296282877
16270. most people do not realize that the congregation	as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally	sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience	in daily relationships with one another is unique	3747.3652583424946
16271. the idea that it	is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken	1181.706375228604
16272. the jewish synagogue	affords a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism	buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they	have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of	prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and	love	4400.813461941618
16273. their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an	altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with	a distinctive kind of fellowship	4460.640024068555
16274. how far the fellowship in most	local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia!	what is now called christian fellowship is often little more	than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind	of people one likes	4454.478397835334
16275. the koinonia of acts and of the epistles	means sharing in a common relation to christ	1884.3167949866988
16276. it is an experience of	a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate	indwelling of christ in his people	2318.5571740572727
16277. as dietrich bonho^ffer puts	it our community with one another consists solely in what christ	has done to both of us	3027.7193865956
16278. this may mean having fellowship in the church	with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness	we might prefer not to have any association at all	3090.426100945551
16279. there is a vast	difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament	describes and the community of congeniality found in the average	church building	4062.2240283373494
16280. whenever a congregation really sees itself	as a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole	body of christ and participating in his mission to the world a necessary	foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid	4229.253128583551
16281. the	antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists	963.0918345918162
16282. the	local and the ecumenical are one	94.57063885867016
16283. of course the perspective	of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the	people of god will always be different from the perspective of those	who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a	particular place	6560.07040081602
16284. each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related	to the other	643.951586984035
16285. neither is adequate if it stands alone	141.03743584471277
16286. our difficulty	arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other	373.09806303397943
16287. and this is what	all too often happens	248.63700242622085
16288. a little parable	illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor	bela vasady at the end of the second world war	2597.986998213819
16289. with great	difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew	his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world	council of churches	4832.555816517078
16290. when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles	his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new	ones	1730.6095527515977
16291. he often spoke of them as his ecumenical	glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is	required in the church	4087.482733264288
16292. it is he said a bifocal vision which can	see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right	relation to both	2616.221451459092
16293. as things stand now the local and the ecumenical	tend to compete with each other	1644.6122047860147
16294. on the one hand there are	ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter	with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church	is doing in their own town	4211.062438294812
16295. they do not escape the pitfall into which	charles dickens pictured mrs jellyby as falling	1646.3258350414878
16296. on the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering	to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation	that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social	responsibility and world mission	6326.746831250261
16297. as a result they go on thinking	of the church with introverted and self-centered satisfaction only	in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families	3111.7146393476132
16298. it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of	the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual	concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the	members	5928.0993430081
16299. the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or	the world	788.7673007270685
16300. the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the	parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable	suburbs	3275.9815823486992
16301. it is eminently successful according to all conventional	standards	262.10963301241213
16302. it is growing in numbers	22.09322670277006
16303. its people are agreeable	friends	14.841982325272724
16304. it has a beautiful edifice	22.13759442702553
16305. its preaching and its music give	refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain	1415.3856785593662
16306. it	provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled	392.9963628203419
16307. it helps children	grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible	946.340559135562
16308. it draws	young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the	church from generation to generation	2828.0538825100602
16309. and it is easy for the ecumenical	enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is	1415.7563537994065
16310. but what	is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians	in the world	2368.2162825973073
16311. all too often its conception of parish ministry	and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation	to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind	3333.645999568391
16312. it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with	the mind of christ	2127.133028942876
16313. it is not helping them face the moral crisis	involved in the use of nuclear energy	1259.1733572837356
16314. it is not making them sensitive	to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial	life	2350.2059097692554
16315. it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship	means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world	to economically underdeveloped peoples	2727.434787616313
16316. it is not developing an awareness	of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young	churches emerge in asia and africa	3893.00054201425
16317. to put it bluntly many	a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want	1409.7075408011556
16318. it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility	in relation to the world	1877.5338643761636
16319. we shall not make a decisive advance	in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not	merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness	and mission to the world	4225.448059297644
16320. there is a humorous but revealing	story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted	to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant	community	5294.093971298344
16321. he built a school and a library then a recreation center	and an inn	949.735361919038
16322. desiring to fill the only remaining lack he selected	the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting	it	3932.9015696103625
16323. a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired do	you belong to this church mr rancher	1258.4661240884686
16324. why no ma'am	he replied this church belongs to me! the story reflects	the way too many people feel	2594.711856425819
16325. as long as the congregation regards	the church as our church or the minister thinks of it as my	church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant	advance	3360.062939556098
16326. there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs	not to us but to christ and that it is his purpose not our own interests	and preferences that determines what it is to be and do	6055.753797600171
16327. embodiment of the whole	a local church which conceives its function	to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and	concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an	extra not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church	4762.403076740958
16328. it would	doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical	it is really failing to be the church of christ	3862.037357049041
16329. yet the	truth according to the new testament is that every local church	has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in	that particular place	3110.8605100234
16330. this was a bitterly	fought game carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight with no	friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness	that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls	that went into the crowd	4470.523514499124
16331. every pitch in the game brought forth	a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors	dropped	called forth yelps of derision	3915.5315264850788
16332. at	one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting	as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in	the kidneys he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled	over whether the ball was dead or the base runners were	free to score	5304.086890937552
16333. this was typical of such games which were earnestly	played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of	good fellowship	3446.7875025328567
16334. when the visitors after losing this game rode along	the village streets toward home the youngsters who could keep abreast	of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly you bunch of	hay-shakers! g'ahn back home! you hay-shakers!   baseball	was surely the national game in those days even though professional	baseball may have been merely a business	5368.5449054237015
16335. radio broadcasts had	not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home	in the town park or a pasture with perhaps two or three trips to the	city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or	the red sox	7164.951951689295
16336. young men in school could look forward to playing	ball for money in a dozen different places even if they failed to	make the major leagues	2728.188769224445
16337. nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might	find a payday awaiting him in the three i league or the pony	league or the coastal plains league or the fast eastern league	if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere	7138.950262891012
16338. even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams	sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores	that played two or three times a week throughout the summer usually in	the cool of the evening before an earnest and partisan audience who	did not begrudge a quarter each or even more to be dropped into a hat	when the game was half over	5813.68926583441
16339. babe ruth of course was everyone's	hero and everyone knew him even though relatively few ever	saw him play ball	2818.464249713515
16340. his face was always in the newspapers sometimes	in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life	1413.120409857755
16341. as the twenties grew	older and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more	and more people daily in the doings of the professionals the great	hitters overshadowed the game so that pitchers	were nearly of no account	6325.415160597294
16342. boys no longer bothered learning to	bunt and even school kids scorned to choke up on a bat as willie	keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done	3234.3214543031477
16343. other	hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared	to dream of matching ruth who was still called jidge by all his	friends or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him	and who called most	of the world kid	7312.164224504045
16344. lou gehrig was given the nickname buster	and he ran ruth a close race in home runs	1419.2439970887501
16345. but the nickname never	stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in color- which is sometimes	a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field	4493.935344579665
16346. ruth	was a delinquent boy still but he was in every way a great ball	player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone	to do it	3437.535927443844
16347. a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities	with the encouragement of the press so that they might	see their names in big black print along with daddy browning's	al capone's earl sande's and the prince of wales'	5908.779292226811
16348. one	who for a time succeeded	best and was still the sorriest of all was charles	arthur shires who called himself in the newspapers art the	great or the great shires	3326.9222766183498
16349. it was his brag that he could beat	everybody at anything but especially at fighting and he once took on	the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists	5322.587644339662
16350. he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;	and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles	in art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first	baseman for some forgotten reason	4559.3248197386565
16351. in his minor way charles	arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was for	he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these	scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers	4606.509229161572
16352. there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;	or who ingested strange objects like live fish; or who undertook	to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor with or without	a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without	pausing for breath	7525.233606538325
16353. one young man exhilarated to the point of insanity	by liquor and the excitement of the moment performed a perfect	swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army	football game landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below	and died at once	4871.255628663678
16354. but the twenties were not all insanity and	a striving after recognition	964.3201163733581
16355. the business of baseball began to prosper	along with other entertainments and performers- thanks partly to	george herman ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his	salary higher and higher- prospered too	3469.6783398547122
16356. while fifty years before	albert goodwill spalding secretary of the chicago ball club of	the national league could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo	club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball	game in august in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium	might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate	8440.972146318503
16357. and	while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox- all of them	top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy charles	comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five	hundred dollars a year stars now were asking ten thousand dollars	twenty thousand dollars yes even fifty thousand dollars a season	5262.198807188071
16358. the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new	york yankees bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club	by men named ed barrow and miller huggins	4832.546363163313
16359. boston fans sometimes	liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the	great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox- sold to millionaires	huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most	trifling desire	4525.065794049276
16360. ruth himself still owning his farm in massachusetts	and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed	his round boyish face on the wrappers had led the parade down from fenway	park followed by pitchers carl mays leslie joe bush	waite hoyt herb pennock and sam jones catcher wally schang	third baseman joe dugan	and shortstop everett scott	8231.165650737294
16361. by 1926 when	the mighty yanks were at their mightiest only a few of these were	left but they still shone brightest even beside able and agile rookies	like tony lazzeri	mark koenig lou gehrig george pipgras and	gray-thatched earl combs	4291.419866680042
16362. the deeds of this team through two seasons	and in the two world's series that followed have been written	and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said	4979.118007666794
16363. but there	is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in	the cheap seats for one world's series game in 1926 like best to	recall	3333.2146886510736
16364. babe ruth as he always did in the stadium played right field	to avoid having the sun in his eyes and tommy thevenow a rather	mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st louis cardinals	knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the	permanent stands and the wooden bleachers where ruth could not reach	it	8363.683097036914
16365. the ball lay there shining white on the grass in view of nearly	every fan in the park while ruth red-necked with frustration charged	about the small patch of ground screaming where's the -ing	ball	3751.1757740347143
16366. but as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over	not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me so little tommy	ran all the way home	4287.146544742953
16367. the ordinary man and woman however saw	little of the great professional games of those golden days or of	any other sporting event for that matter	2718.5209938665657
16368. promoters always hastened	to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators	and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in	with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest	of any importance	7502.500799425603
16369. radio broadcasts however- now that even plain	people could afford loud speakers on their sets- held old	fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones chiefly women	who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition	became first inured then attracted then addicted to the long	afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park	5463.929001474661
16370. in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on	weekends the announcer was silenced and fans must needs drive to the	city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring	5900.742728453369
16371. this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well	as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies some of which began	to offer special excursion rates including seats at the park just	as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new	4841.092293934862
16372. the questions women asked at baseball games were standard	grist for amateur comedy as were the doings of women automobile drivers;	for every grown man	knew at least the fundamentals of baseball just	as every male american in this era liked to imagine that	he could fight with his fists	4938.174484292659
16373. and women were not expected to know	that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball	2806.6254559959834
16374. radio however so increased the interest of women in the game	that it was hardly necessary even to have ladies' days any longer	to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home	3827.8823950861515
16375. women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands where	they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice	stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears	5656.710669673013
16376. the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative	despite the baseball jargon that girls and women could begin to	store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics	that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their	lessons in school	4817.821595334781
16377. this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores	will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal	and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for	preserving the ideal	5354.618372684876
16378. our discussion of this involves using	erik erikson's schema of identity vs identity diffusion	as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto	the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers	from whose case histories we quoted earlier	4403.609749242286
16379. our discussion does not	utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson but is intended	to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying	unwed mothers	4286.600916924302
16380. we hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological	standpoint the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous	long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy	through adolescence	3209.333633292179
16381. hypothesizing a series of developmental	stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old	age erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series	of identity crises	5169.871804870105
16382. the successful and positive resolution of these	crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during	adolescence the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity	crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having	resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy	childhood and early adolescence	4828.41737791639
16383. within erikson's schema the	adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case her unwed motherhood-	reflects her identity diffusion or her inability to resolve	these various identity crises positively	4285.819673154798
16384. the adolescent	experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs time diffusion	785.6059490955408
16385. time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and	to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range	objectives- is more easily developed if from infancy on the individual	has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which	she lives	7157.079297958209
16386. erikson has noted that unless this trust developed early	the time ambivalence experienced in varying degree and temporarily	by all adolescents	gratification of wants during childhood while not yet having fully	may develop	into a more permanent sense of time diffusion	4273.491083595114
16387. experience of this time	diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate	urgency to act immediately	3062.35572342443
16388. these polar extremes in time	diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported	in earlier chapters	1876.2124725882618
16389. some of these mothers apparently feeling a	desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love	and sex that would have life-long consequences	4117.6373188442
16390. others displayed	utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future	1100.1766282213061
16391. for many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life	and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources	of their	basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in	general	5822.492891502121
16392. however as erickson has noted the individual's	failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood	need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of	identity diffusion in his adolescence	3547.021711577603
16393. and as shown in chapter	6 some snp females originally developed such trust only	during their adolescence through the aid of and their identification	with alter-parents	4108.087790553676
16394. in the specific case of time diffusion we	must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust	when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by	most adolescents in our society and with the failure of	the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust	4819.723907569256
16395. the adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty	vs an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation	vs negative identity	2143.965566794932
16396. a sense of self-certainty and the freedom	to experiment with different roles or confidence in one's own unique	behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity is more easily	developed during adolescence if during early childhood the individual	was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some	autonomy	4825.588310087634
16397. however if the child has been constantly surrounded	during nursery and early school age by peer groups; inculcated	with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed	little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence	her normal degree of vanity sensitivity and preoccupation with	whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable will be compounded	8254.277817388398
16398. her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions	and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence	are the manifestations in her adolescence of her having been indoctrinated	in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave	in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her nursery-	and elementary-school peer friends	5346.014600516694
16399. to be different is to invite	shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's	parents who already consider one different and difficult to understand	than by one's peers who are also experiencing a similar groping	for and denial of adult status	7116.319392039851
16400. the attitudes of some unwed	mothers quoted in chapter 2 revealed both considerable preoccupation	with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty	2610.7395043494175
16401. many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable	means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but	very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need	to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and	with one's self	6834.927040824409
16402. another identity crisis confronting the	adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs work-paralysis	643.9949615336369
16403. the adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise	the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends	on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy initiative and	self-discipline during childhood	5176.920105658843
16404. the developmental process involves	the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement	resulting from having completed tasks having kept commitments	and having created something	dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought		3133.9879584996606
16405. these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty	that the adolescent needs for experimenting with many roles and	for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and	discovering her skills and abilities	5620.035424331674
16406. if she has not had such	experiences the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will	be compounded	1418.0706939578868
16407. erikson has noted that as	this indecision mounts it may result in a paralysis of workmanship	1249.9680747376567
16408. this paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and	never completing- many jobs tasks and courses of study; and in	the fact that she bases her decisions about work college carreer and	studies on what others are doing rather than on her own sense of identity	with given skills abilities likes and dislikes	7819.899370310649
16409. the absence	during her childhood and early adolescence of experiences in developing	the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences	that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement-	and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy	and initiative in play and expression both tend in her adolescence	to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally	in experimenting	5717.63044409094
16410. the comments made by some unwed mothers	reflect this paralysis of workmanship	963.3816725901228
16411. they	attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions	others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available	convenient and paid reasonably	2872.838259599492
16412. these things both express and	at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion	in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and	self-certainty	4658.697382617201
16413. as their identity diffusion increased they became more	susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs	1420.020242472125
16414. these	affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities	containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship	no sense of dignity derived from a job well done	4839.124563223223
16415. childhood	experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context	of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance	for the prevention of illegitimacy	2472.364700028163
16416. the excerpts from case histories	presented above confirm this significance though through different	facets of experience	1867.4013456894104
16417. for example some unwed mothers had had no work	experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood	and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours	in searching for something exciting and diverting	3461.656893637115
16418. on	the other hand some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility	imposed on them at an early age and had thus had so little freedom	or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that their work	and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped	and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden	sexual behavior	8221.373273654859
16419. the adolescent also faces the identity	crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs diffusion	of ideals	1420.380936944563
16420. in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations	for the prevention of illegitimacy we shall again superimpose	erikson's concept on our data	3676.381463403228
16421. adolescents have a much-discussed	tendency to polarize ideas and values to perceive things as	either-or black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively	unimportant	2451.926323051751
16422. this tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the	literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents	2118.42625779987
16423. erikson	has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily	resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly	changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood	2856.5801571338043
16424. it provides identification- with an idea a value a cause that	cuts through or even transcends the multiple and ambivalent identities	of their passage from child to adult and permits their forceful	and overt expression of emotion	5948.329464334293
16425. the positive development during	adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with	increasing independence and to identify overtly either with or against	given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree	on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy	initiative and self-certainty	4831.8729760451715
16426. most adolescents have some ideological	diffusion at various developmental stages as they experience a proliferation	of ideas and values	2599.820432024185
16427. the diffusion is most pronounced and	most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very	minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could	have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources	of developing self-certainty	4540.248353390445
16428. a pronounced ideological	diffusion- ie inability to identify independently with given	ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways	2832.4973693603883
16429. for example	it is evinced by the adolescent whose beliefs and actions	represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior	patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice	3561.2836495709935
16430. it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans whose ideas and	behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide	with those of the individual or group present and most important	at the moment	5773.582378407895
16431. in another sense it is represented in the arguments	of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all	other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs	3431.6993053276265
16432. the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological	diffusion embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify	independently with a given value system or behavior pattern and	her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility	for her sexual behavior	6334.657066012671
16433. for example the unwed mothers expressed	their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what	it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly	3240.3330418752785
16434. they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital	sexual intercourse	1185.9170389608407
16435. they condemned the movie script writers for implying	that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating	940.970367651782
16436. they criticized parents	for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong;	and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive	or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant	5613.433410091392
16437. in the adult world there are a number of rather general and	diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the	adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis	3228.9402076845863
16438. for example some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good	guys and the bad guys to portray the weak people as heroes and	weakness as a virtue and to explain asocial behavior	by attributing it to deterministic psychological familial and social	experiences	6574.163931251935
16439. in the final accounting these would have augmented the bill for both	sides	790.7884779432154
16440. an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive	565.3224598084664
16441. yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation	which many regarded as wasteful indirectly contributed to constructive	changes in legal procedure	2456.4677618226488
16442. the duration and other circumstances	of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of	patent infringement actions	3258.392629895584
16443. the suit as we have seen came before	the courts when patent attorneys inventors and laymen were making mounting	demands for reforms in the american patent system	2852.5002518559636
16444. chief among	the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures	in equity	1637.464841495719
16445. in a long and angry footnote to his opinion	judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism	2027.1458676789825
16446. it is a duty said hough not to let pass this opportunity	of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony	in equity current in this circuit excused	if not justified by the rules of the supreme court especially to	be found in patent causes and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation	7583.175390516035
16447. as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition	rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer	i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged and expensive	prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity	4206.908905616175
16448. observing	that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible	examples hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing	procedures	2822.1121916952848
16449. he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case	record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous	squabbles over minor matters; the objections stated at outrageous	length; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts uncalled	for and	unjustifiable from the retort discourteous to the lie direct	4757.644674758102
16450. the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was	a striking example concluded hough will	remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial	officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline	and the reception or exclusion of testimony	6573.509088698435
16451. not least	among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment	were those who had participated in the selden suit	2315.195524667142
16452. william a	redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under	rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty	days instead of five years	5003.508240490516
16453. inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for	reform inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a horrible	example	1573.4155348406216
16454. its costive deliberations were likened to those of	the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in	bleak house	2810.853499690258
16455. parker who agreed with much of this criticism	did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects	1246.410397898917
16456. but	he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried	748.8185310860899
16457. in a detailed	letter published in the scientific american in 1912 he	remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding	of the facts	2594.7751158847736
16458. the suit although commonly designated as a single	action actually embraced five cases	1188.1509574949143
16459. parker insisted that the size	of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable	duplication of testimony	1885.9038406733446
16460. in a private communication written	in 1911 parker had been more to the point	1410.3309190309983
16461. noting the complaints	of inventors and members of the patent bar he admitted that some	of the strictures were fairly well founded but he added that under	existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group	of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent	4746.634992235611
16462. the	vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit as well as the	complex character of the automotive art encouraged both sides to exploit	every possible chance for or against the patent said parker	5634.463339687609
16463. this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases and	of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the	record beyond what ordinarily would occur	3547.9717724020275
16464. parker listed the	remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony	1642.5823200841041
16465. the most important of these found him in agreement with hough's	plea for reform	945.3035303609593
16466. parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate	or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court	who had no authority to limit testimony	3912.1153776745546
16467. the taking of depositions	he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner empowered	to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial	testimony	2738.5972565426023
16468. i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power	existed and this course been pursued it would have shortened	the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of	the other witnesses thereto more than that	6448.078146400154
16469. in the end hough's	acidulous protest which parker called the now somewhat famous	note on this 'selden' case did not go unheeded	2166.0963014142244
16470. in 1912	the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity	which became effective on february 1 1913	3250.1535110789487
16471. the revised procedure	was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform	263.6805918466242
16472. under the new rules testimony	is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary	character	2812.0271640320043
16473. other expeditious methods are designed to prevent	prolixity limit delays and reduce the expense of infringement suits	1405.515750804371
16474. one of the alam lawyers observed that if the selden	case had been tried under this simplified procedure the testimony	which filled more than a score of volumes at a minimum cost of $1	a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume	7033.638419342841
16475. while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive	forms of litigation these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums	of money	2310.774883977342
16476. there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme	court as a direct result of the selden patent suit	3041.8879876505616
16477. even	before it was formally dissolved in 1912 the alam	was succeeded by the automobile board of trade the direct lineal	ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association	2968.5548770484957
16478. the trade bodies which came in the wake of the alam	were more representative for they never adopted a policy of exclusion	3246.6275337534307
16479. nevertheless it is from the selden organization that the industry	inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests	of the trade	2188.5750679213597
16480. one of the chief features of this community of interest	is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement a milestone	in the development of american industrial cooperation	3879.424043011396
16481. its origin	lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath	501.31469763927646
16482. from	the earliest days of the motor car industry before the alam	was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and	vexing problem	3483.4584384341288
16483. many patent contests were waged over automobile components	and accessories among them tires detachable rims ball bearings	license brackets and electric horns	2171.1677415431764
16484. the fluidity and momentum of	the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims	1643.3622520610454
16485. as	early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with	the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers	2050.871660264903
16486. this scheme failed and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement	suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest	in 1912	3254.7350717788327
16487. in this tangle of conflicting claims the patent-sharing	scheme adopted by the alam at its founding proved	to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant	litigation	3336.2202926082987
16488. the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty	eliminated infringement suits among the members of the alam	patent pool	and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive	technology	4828.6414014788525
16489. one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition	upon the withholding of patent rights among alam members	1724.0538086717079
16490. within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics	of a cross-licensing agreement	1654.7267531475177
16491. its positive features	outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly	1264.0711412060414
16492. since the alam holdings embraced only about twenty-five	per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent	companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors	of the industry	5153.427714295493
16493. the highly important dyer patents on the sliding	gear transmission were held by the alam pool	1251.0332531373078
16494. but henry	ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier	cars and in 1905 as a precautionary measure took out a license	from the man who claimed to be its inventor	5493.389456250375
16495. for those affiliated	with it the alam pool was a haven from the infringement	actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting	intensity after 1900	2868.347731701849
16496. by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases	many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions	2560.858339628849
16497. it was commonplace for auto makers parts-suppliers and dealers	to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their	daily mail	2166.1854157406574
16498. purely from the business man's standpoint and without	regard to the lawyer's view commented a trade journal the	matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing	some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents	are to become weapons of warfare in business instead of simple beneficient	protection devices for encouraging inventive creation	8207.083314301131
16499. occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain	prospect of legal complications	784.4154731491453
16500. one manufacturer who held an allegedly	basic patent said: i would readily put over $50000 into the	manufacture of the device but it is so easy to make that we would enter	immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would	eat up all our profits	7134.56478842686
16501. the prevailing view in the industry was	summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee:	the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions	including delays surrounding legal disputes particularly in patent	litigation are items of industrial burden which must be written	large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste	5362.389686841032
16502. by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping	constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical	information	3253.599521015722
16503. at this point charles c hanch long an advocate	of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee	of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor	to the automobile board of trade	3747.2800139016713
16504. hanch was treasurer of the nordyke	+ marmon company an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling	machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904	2360.1506024708133
16505. he had	first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety	per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's	2724.2885031350916
16506. anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry	hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading	alam members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan	4820.226587464073
16507. the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal but hanch	did not abandon his scheme	1407.4547548398527
16508. after the demise of the alam	the time was propitious for establishing such a pool	1646.6550149777104
16509. most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal	interchange of patents	1100.281869554979
16510. it is a much easier course to agree to	let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned said	a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of straightening	the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system	which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day	7824.874069711645
16511. with the other members of the patents committee- wilfred c leland	howard e coffin windsor t white and w h	vandervoort- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential	feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution	3873.957956559493
16512. the	plan was supported by frederick p fish counsel for the national	automobile chamber of commerce	1871.6261181933846
16513. it will be recalled that in his	summation for the alam before judge hough fish had	condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial	community	2857.7601600490952
16514. he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used	their patents solely for nuisance value	2134.0173129966324
16515. my personal view is that	not one patented invention in ten is worth making he later told	a congressional committee	1875.1247434706288
16516. the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed	the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association	2593.1841945607857

16551. when you stand before	the barrel-vaulted you have the impression that the statue	at	the end is at a considerable distance yet it is actually only a few	feet away	3225.839114906645
16552. the sense of perspective has been created by designing the	length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade	are much shorter than those in front	4983.568045921811
16553. the gardens of the palazzo	shaded by a huge magnolia tree are most attractive	946.5214741478615

16565. your	first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains	its two churches that almost face each other and its russet-colored	buildings is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly	welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have	followed since starting this walk	4817.973154865236
16566. the site of the oblong	piazza is which was probably used	for horse and chariot races	1889.0366982603541
16567. for centuries it was the location of historic	festivals and open-air sports events	785.8087451504509
16568. from the seventeenth to	the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in	the summer and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated	square in their carriages	5183.578232187045
16569. giovanni bernini's fountain	of the rivers in the center of the piazza is built around	a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes	and rocks with four huge figures one at each corner denoting four	great rivers from different continents- the danube the ganges the	nile and the plate	5170.023742779786
16570. the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered	perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure	from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant' agnese	in agone the work of bernini's rival borromini	6573.938608423967
16571. in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can	sit have a drink or lunch and watch the fountains in the square	2615.586958942262
16572. the	scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about	rome	1422.215584135371
16573. perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch	503.47760033931235
16574. take the via di s agnese in agone next to the church	and opposite the center of the square then turn right after about	two hundred yards to reach the beautiful church of santa maria della	pace	5916.785131930051
16575. inside you will find the lovely sibyls painted by raphael	and a chapel designed by michelangelo	1266.0520306454841
16576. the church's cloisters	are among donato bramante's most beautiful creations	560.948383729365
16577. now	return to the piazza navona and leave it on the opposite side by the	corsia agonale; in a moment cross the corso del rinascimento	2589.016294850181
16578. in front of you is the once belonging to the	medici and now the walk by the side of the	palazzo and after two blocks along the via giustiniani you will come	to the	the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the	days of ancient rome	7168.338609725024
16579. this circular edifice constructed by	agrippa in bc 27 was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor	hadrian	1725.5693351531638
16580. it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century	567.0799770333688
16581. as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the	temple of isis you will admire the pantheon's impressive corinthian	columns	2475.507872766319
16582. the pantheon's interior still in its original	form is truly majestic and an architectural triumph	1648.9568795043633
16583. its	forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from	the floor to the ceiling	1585.2203204954649
16584. the only means of interior light is the	twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous standing	before the tomb of raphael the great genius of the renaissance when	shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple you are	once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of	rome	7250.1800603550855
16585. as you leave the pantheon take the narrow street to	the right the via del seminario a block to	one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city	3115.818998477283
16586. there about one hundred yards on your right you pass a simple restaurant	the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church	seems like a stage set	4667.727983883188
16587. this is one of the most charming little	squares in this part of rome	936.6437396287881
16588. one block along the via de burro	will bring you to the in	the old a few yards farther on the via	dei bergamaschi is the the great column from	which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus	aurelius	6748.762480589125
16589. you are now at the though narrow one	of rome's busiest streets	642.643628800561
16590. horse races took place here in the middle	ages	392.82507609335454
16591. if you have taken this stroll in the morning and you have	the time and inclination walk to the right along the crowded corso	for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings-	mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the		3790.108423922079
16592. here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where	the family still lives	1882.2394829530235
16593. otherwise cross over the corso and	walk a block or so to the left	949.9594948973667
16594. you will come to a	delightful though moderately expensive restaurant which is particularly	noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries	3466.6617409690652
16595. either here or in one of the modest restaurants nearby is just the	to the spanish	the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken	after lunch so that you will reach the when	the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best	4774.165352416332
16596. rare indeed is the harlem citizen from the most circumspect church	member to the most shiftless adolescent who does not have a long tale	to tell of police incompetence injustice or brutality	5185.382365585316
16597. i myself	have witnessed and endured it more than once	372.1768653774174
16598. the businessmen and racketeers	also have a story	250.8538446511781
16599. and so do the prostitutes	14.857254586587743
16600. perhaps the place to discuss harlem's very complex attitude toward	black policemen nor the reasons according to harlem that they	it is hard on the other hand to blame	the policeman blank good-natured thoughtless and insuperably	innocent for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves	7212.899119510666
16601. he too believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended	when they are not taken for the deed	1722.969799969699
16602. he has never himself done	anything for which to be hated- which of us has	1640.5360309180894
16603. - and yet he is	facing daily and nightly people who would gladly see him dead and he	knows it	1103.9915363346643
16604. there is no way for him not to know it: there are few things	under heaven more unnerving than the silent accumulating contempt	and hatred of a people	4478.72366286209
16605. he moves through harlem therefore like	an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely	what and where he is and is the reason he walks in twos and threes	3453.868673724767
16606. and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company:	the people who are watching him know why too	3691.798140172066
16607. any street meeting	sacred or secular which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as	its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white	domination	3006.226593055976
16608. and these days of course in terms increasingly vivid and	jubilant it speaks of the end of that domination	2573.1787516327518
16609. the white policeman	standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center	of the revolution now occurring in the world	2335.48389179306
16610. he is not prepared	for it- naturally nobody is- and what is possibly much more to the	point he is exposed as few white people are to the anguish of the	black people around him	5645.313238060311
16611. even if he is gifted with the merest mustard	grain of imagination something must seep in	1257.547938560438
16612. he cannot avoid observing	that some of the children in spite of their color remind him of	children he has known and loved perhaps even of his own children	4661.299190870004
16613. he	knows that he certainly does not want his children living this	way	787.2145910513536
16614. he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into	a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature	2597.675305231475
16615. he becomes more	callous the population becomes more hostile the situation grows	more tense and the police force is increased	1892.8635667025071
16616. one day to everyone's	astonishment someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything	blows up	2124.177333385499
16617. before the dust has settled or the blood congealed editorials	speeches and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land demanding	to know what happened	2464.981073575783
16618. what happened is that negroes want to	be treated like men	749.0891976505318
16619. negroes want to be treated like men:	a perfectly straightforward statement containing only seven words	1104.6131036190568
16620. people who have mastered kant hegel shakespeare marx freud	and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable	2124.825103586717
16621. the idea seems	to threaten profound barely conscious assumptions	260.64765931815367
16622. a kind of panic	paralyzes their features as though they found themselves trapped on	the edge of a steep place	2835.714567889914
16623. i once tried to describe to a very well-known	american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south	1578.6451384490367
16624. my recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me	in perfect innocence why don't all the negroes in the south	move north	3883.58654190914
16625. i tried to explain what has happened unfailingly	whenever a significant body of negroes move north	1256.208931050344
16626. they do not	escape jim crow: they merely encounter another not-less-deadly	variety	951.8754911244223
16627. they do not move to chicago they move to the south side;	they do not move to new york they move to harlem	2303.2069236089615
16628. the pressure	within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand and this expansion	is always violent	2123.0050323117707
16629. white people hold the line as long as they can	and in as many ways as they can from verbal intimidation to physical	violence	2475.1354265630803
16630. but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from	the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto	3285.2987453208502
16631. the white	people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make	a tidy profit by raising the rent chopping up the rooms and all but	dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood	turns into a turf	4387.852942114872
16632. this is precisely what happened when the puerto	ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused	is as i write being fought out all up and down those streets	4996.728875772252
16633. northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury	94.61597803305172
16634. they seem	to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil	war and won they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going	on in the south without taking any responsibility for it; and	that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what	is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse	8325.945023581848
16635. well in the	first place it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both	to know which is worse	2026.7838324094787
16636. i know negroes who prefer the south and	white southerners because at least there you haven't got to	play any guessing games! the guessing games referred to have driven	more than one negro into the narcotics ward the madhouse or the	river	6573.819732093189
16637. i know another negro a man very dear to me who says with	conviction and with truth the spirit of the south is the spirit	of america	2862.3161493058656
16638. he was born in the north and did his military training	in the south	1411.3662513926295
16639. he did not as far as i can gather find the south	worse; he found it if anything all too familiar	2043.0986451164063
16640. in the	second place though even if birmingham is worse no doubt	johannesburg south africa beats it by several miles and buchenwald	was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history	of the world	6067.613274824489
16641. the world has never lacked for horrifying examples;	but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification	for our own crimes	2863.1417280279193
16642. this perpetual justification empties	the heart of all human feeling	557.5179976702073
16643. the emptier our hearts become the greater	will be our crimes	501.7156657741922
16644. thirdly the south is not merely an embarrassingly	backward region but a part of this country and what happens	there concerns every one of us	3880.390258142458
16645. as far as the color problem	is concerned there is but one great difference between the southern	white and the northerner: the southerner remembers historically and	in his own psyche a kind of eden in which he loved black people and	they loved him	4562.261938747155
16646. historically the flaming sword laid across this eden	is the civil war	962.5239834313581
16647. personally it is the southerner's sexual	coming of age when without any warning unbreakable taboos are set	up between himself and his past	2318.0848545602316
16648. everything thereafter is permitted	him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need	1903.9170027739074
16649. the resulting	indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the	basis of the southern hysteria	1263.3967035040366
16650. none of this is true for the	northerner	250.70089443290186
16651. negroes represent nothing to him personally except perhaps	the dangers of carnality	642.0635287915514
16652. southerners	see them all the time	65.09816170647056
16653. northerners never think about them whereas southerners	are never really thinking of anything else	939.4760759571724
16654. negroes are	therefore ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south	and suffer hideously in both places	2833.843693113824
16655. neither the southerner nor	the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man	1420.0338358252106
16656. it seems	to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be	considered either as a kind of ward	negroes comparatively bought cadillacs last year and how few	comparatively	or as a victim	that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our		5891.108398456194
16657. they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change-	cannot change- until the north changes	1882.0115633853966
16658. the country will	not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really	means by freedom	2104.68292934455
16659. in the meantime generations keep being born bitterness	is increased by incompetence pride and folly and the world shrinks	around us	2040.066775012631
16660. it is a terrible an inexorable law that one	cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own:	in the face of one's victim one sees oneself	4488.775219067105
16661. walk through the	streets of harlem and see what we this nation have become	936.080986621756
16662. river downtown: postscript to a letter from harlem	the	fact that american negroes rioted in the un while adlai	stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white	americans	4832.266024886928
16663. stevenson's speech and the spectacular disturbance	in the gallery were both touched off by the death in katanga the	day before of patrice lumumba	2469.716186732177
16664. stevenson stated in the course of	his address that the united states was against colonialism	1639.552855679367
16665. god	knows what the african nations who hold 25 per cent of the voting	stock in the un were thinking- they may for example have	been thinking of the us abstention when the vote on algerian	freedom was before the assembly- but i think i have a fairly accurate	notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking	5457.088187604819
16666. i had	intended to be there myself	140.2161084433557
16667. it was my first reaction upon hearing	of lumumba's death	374.9341959124552
16668. i was curious about the impact of this political	assassination on negroes in harlem for lumumba had- has- captured	the popular imagination there	3482.5987347043047
16669. i was curious to know if lumumba's	death which is surely among the most sinister of recent events	would elicit from our side anything more than the usual well-meaning	rhetoric	3225.8544542650934
16670. and i was curious about the african reaction	253.34108919926493
16671. however the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the un	gallery	792.6226942380063
16672. had i been there i too in the eyes of most americans	would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists	3691.649096891172
16673. the	climate and the events of the last decade and the steady pressure of	the cold war have given americans yet another means of avoiding	self-examination and so it has been decided that the riots were communist	inspired	4041.4135111954943
16674. nor was it long naturally before prominent	negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the un rioters	do not represent the real feeling of the negro community	4477.640541813598
16675. according then to what i take to be the prevailing view these rioters	were merely a handful of irresponsible stalinist-corrupted provocateurs	2024.789077359345
16676. i find this view amazing	22.358490039690338
16677. it is a view which even	a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict	950.0770681886024
16678. one	has only for example to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions	1410.2928201124676
16679. the first question is: would i like to live here	377.0415572625489
16680. and the second question is: why don't those who now live here move	out	1400.9907263540385
16681. the answer to both questions is immediately obvious	167.71361665015453
16682. unless	one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that negroes	are somehow different from white people i do not see how one can	escape the conclusion that the negro's status in this country is	not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability	6948.893523349318
16683. now	i do not doubt that among the people at the un that day there	were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the	most cynical motives	2849.360844966636
16684. wherever there is great social discontent these	people are sooner or later to be found	1648.4484088595327
16685. their presence is not as	frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity	791.0472100312634
16686. what	i find appalling- and really dangerous- is the american assumption	that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical	agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest	5642.130105725966
16687. it is a notion	which contains a gratuitous insult implying as it does that negroes	can make no move unless they are manipulated	2319.5155219417234
16688. color was delayed until 1935 the wide screen until the early fifties	963.4587094772994
16689. movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction	of the primitive movies of the nineties	1424.1872293863714
16690. each film consisted of fifty	feet which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen	2361.9820463066717
16691. as long as audiences came to see the movement there seemed little reason	to adventure further	1253.467340301547
16692. motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores	in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can	still be found in such urban areas as times square	4460.561017649328
16693. brief snips of	actual events were shown: parades dances street scenes	501.9225925205542
16694. the sensational	and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at	the audience or a great wave threatens to break over the seats	3494.091683361096
16695. an	early edison production was the execution of mary queen of scots	638.2364629504297
16696. the unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung	his axe; the head dropped off; end of film	2368.7379966741487
16697. an early film by	a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss	performed by two actors of the contemporary stage	2594.0542446261147
16698. in the field	of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective	as audience boredom and the first decade of the new device was not over	before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded	one-minute shows	6469.873629659619
16699. in response the industry allowed the discovery	of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies	the essential form they have had to this day	3242.9132685314166
16700. despite the sheer	beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries art films and travelogues	despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development	as cinerama the movies are at heart a form of fiction like the	play the novel or the short story	6696.287020349753
16701. moreover the most artistically	successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative	form from the fiction feature	1744.6152792797718
16702. thus such great american documentaries	as the river and the plow that broke the plains	were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures	3894.679447669691
16703. the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early	years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men a french	magician georges melies and an american employee of edison edwin	s porter	4237.383480037214
16704. of the two porter is justly the better known for	he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the	first step toward fashioning a language of film toward making the motion	picture the intricate efficient time machine that it has remained	since even in the most inept hands	7729.983564043508
16705. melies however out of his professional instincts as a magician	discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain	part of the vocabulary of film	2972.24174857862
16706. one of these is the dissolve	which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene	2126.6639743426113
16707. as the first scene begins to fade the succeeding scene begins	to appear	789.1418152044437
16708. for a moment or two both scenes are present simultaneously	one growing weaker one growing stronger	1888.7018703767194
16709. in a series of fairy tales	and fantasies melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped	to tell a straightforward story with beginning middle and end complications	resolutions climaxes and conclusions	3340.072430584331
16710. immediately the	film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content	based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time	3875.3143907579097
16711. physically a movie is possible because a series of images is projected	one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one	that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing	4066.9708780356063
16712. linking	the smoothly changing images together the eye itself endows them	with the illusion of movement	1868.8669355219176
16713. the projection time of painting	and sculpture is highly subjective varying from person to person and	even varying for a given person on different occasions	2596.0091557911537
16714. so is the time	of the novel	140.25535290305024
16715. the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall	both have a fixed time but the time is fixed by the director and the	players the conductor and the instrumentalists subject therefore	to much variation as record collectors well know	4420.979254634917
16716. the time of the motion	picture is fixed absolutely	393.7162668734177
16717. the film consists of a series of still	transparent photographs or frames 35-mm-wide	789.2754322691978
16718. each frame	comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected	on the screen at the rate for silent movies of 16 frames per second	and for sound films 24 frames per second	5666.282263607323
16719. this is the rate of projection;	it is also the rate of photographing	783.3996434272235
16720. time is built into	the motion picture which cannot exist without time	961.292140764149
16721. now time is also	the concern of the fictional narrative which is at its simplest	the story of an action with usually a beginning a middle and an end-	elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence	4225.590611156651
16722. the moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the	audience is to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same	subject but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic	element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which	would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo	8281.797229468779
16723. in narrative	time is essential as it is in film	375.44522132171096
16724. almost everything about the	movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created	and maintained between narrative time and film time	3703.6858658687115
16725. this discovery	of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling	magician's tricks produced on film	1412.5946291635685
16726. it was porter however	who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the	half century of film history that has since ensued	4099.795070459726
16727. the movie was the	great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and	art were all but incalculable	1880.5118892265552
16728. overnight for one thing porter's	film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten	1643.8289987258704
16729. the	great train robbery is a one-reel film	169.01793440861974
16730. one reel- from eight to	twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of robbery	1903 until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of	a nation in 1915	4810.570189069066
16731. the reel itself became and still is the standard	of measure for the movies	944.1703921904793
16732. the material of the porter film	is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the	years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old west-	pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's	6823.19428824949
16733. a	band of robbers enters a railroad station overpowers and ties up the	telegraph operator holds up the train and escapes	2028.4667977058034
16734. a posse is formed	and pursues the robbers who having made their escape are whooping	it up with some wild wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out	4081.986965610232
16735. the robbers	run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and are shot	dead by the posse	1739.8950661023282
16736. as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the	band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience	3268.4192142661623
16737. all this is simple enough but in telling the story porter did	two important things that had not been done before	2027.7881609741107
16738. each scene is shot	straight through as had been the universal custom from a camera fixed	in a single position but in the outdoor scenes especially in the	capture and destruction of the outlaws porter's camera position	breaks necessarily with the camera position standard until then which	had been roughly that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at	a play	8440.54207125308
16739. the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the	plane of the film in the camera or on the screen	2477.110606262281
16740. if the change at	first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the italian painters	about two hundred years to make an analogous change and the italian	painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of	geniuses any art has seen	6766.449952295554
16741. in that apparently simple shift porter	opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of	art as well as a mechanical recording device	3002.9071351090506
16742. he did more than	that	22.10060894283544
16743. he revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic	technique in the art of the film	1575.0018965936272
16744. cutting of course takes place automatically	in the creation of a film	963.4220685639169
16745. the meaning of the word is quite	physical to begin with	504.87267952395985
16746. the physical film is cut with a knife at the	end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically	by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence	5638.277142835002
16747. if	as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of your child	taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event	2614.372184806988
16748. if in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends	you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's	grandmother watching this event you have begun to be an artist in	film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting	7344.31295630687
16749. this is what porter did	14.826508421179264
16750. as the robbers leave the looted	train the film suddenly cuts back to the station where the telegrapher's	little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only	to find him bound on the floor	5496.672481083078
16751. she dashes around in alarm	14.750160309997133
16752. the two	events are taking place at the same time	563.4887267575276
16753. time and space have both become	cinematic	94.50135012520667
16754. we leap from event to event- including the formation	of the posse- even though the events in reality are taking	place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but	at a considerable distance	5783.968713263445
16755. the chase as a standard film	device probably dates from the great train robbery and there	is a reason for the continued popularity of the device	2744.9178332126285
16756. the chase in	itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands	cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage	of the journey of both	5195.303350667193
16757. the simple naked idea of one man chasing another	is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other	form of fiction	2851.042235682401
16758. the cowboy films the cops and robbers films and	the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not	only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;	these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively	or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative	7736.523659387795
16759. there	still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full	potential of the new form and to make it an art	2603.230876633198
16760. the man was dw	griffith	22.340084278954997
16761. when he came to the movies- more or less by accident-	they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking	for an idle few minutes	2716.926159792437
16762. in about seven years griffith either	invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource	at the disposal of the film maker	3512.4077887037465
16763. before he was forty griffith	had created the art of the film	643.6557639587415
16764. not that there had not been	attempts mostly european to do exactly that	1178.4400529507825
16765. but in general the european	efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly	emerging language of the film itself	2326.603965118688
16766. staggeringly condensed versions	of famous novels and famous plays were presented	746.4801327894661
16767. great actors	and actresses- the most notable being sarah bernhardt- were hired	to repeat their stage performances before the camera	1876.160501616816
16768. in all of this	extensive and expensive effort the camera was downgraded to the status	of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor	or by the author	4847.473674844003
16769. the phonograph today for all its high fidelity	and stereophonic sound is precisely what the early art purveyors in	the movies wished to make of the camera	2869.1064325071393
16770. not surprisingly this approach	did not work	140.521324408398
16771. the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques	in the early years of the century and some interesting records	of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names	3239.0581470957522
16772. but no art	at all was born of the art effort in the early movies	1646.5430518221795
16773. in general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis;	congregational membership however is another thing	1714.212628069284
16774. a congregation	survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;	that is when it can preserve economic integration	2829.2217438047214
16775. religious	faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in	a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group requires	some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining;	the presence of other members of similar social and economic	level is the sufficient condition	4898.14612705836
16776. the breakdown of social	homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account	for the decline of central city churches	3680.5782283283324
16777. central cities reveal	two adverse features for the major denominations: central cities	tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; central	cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition	3433.084489954154
16778. the central	city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which	violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations:	they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people	with lower-class residents	5619.358515627855
16779. central city areas have become progressively	poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus	of middle-class people from most central cities	2186.1959596266297
16780. with few exceptions	the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central	city	1655.1389766933873
16781. the key to protestant development therefore is economic	integration of the nucleus of the congregation	1101.703609389921
16782. members of higher	and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant	figures on social class give the impression of spread over all	social classes; but this is deceptive for the core of membership	is	concentrated in a single social and economic stratum	7028.868324036981
16783. the congregation	perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the	neighborhood; moreover residential mobility is so high in metropolitan	areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum	in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members	from the church without collapsing but they need adequate recruits	for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration	5786.342152365186
16784. the	congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is	secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship	2372.0593160036597
16785. if it were primarily	a believing fellowship it would recruit believers from all social	and economic ranks something which most congregations of the new protestantism	have not been able to do	3337.843160594938
16786. they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers	753.0216449136525
16787. the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences	has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of protestant	religious life; in fact a contrast is often drawn in this regard	with the impersonal roman catholic parish	3858.749998803368
16788. we have seen that	the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently the	vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress	on personal community in protestant congregations; actually there	is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations	as we shall see in another connection	7391.006699190012
16789. the vulnerability of	protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of	the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is	a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore	to the principle of economic integration	4390.630343136892
16790. this fact is evident	in the recruitment of new members	557.5674663258683
16791. the	rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the	missionary outreach of the major denominations	1736.9612319151718
16792. there is much talk	in theological circles about the church as mission and the church's	mission; theologians have been stressing the fact that	the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in	the world for the healing of the world	6965.535445658186
16793. a crucial question therefore	is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism	943.2683693248111
16794. if economic integration really shapes congregational life then	evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration	2122.51621470799
16795. the task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration	as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar	social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation	3674.59812874875
16796. fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power	in a	mobile society congregational health depends on a constant process of	recruitment; this recruitment however must follow the pattern of	economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore	the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation	rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated	8550.521252848343
16797. evangelism and congregational outreach have not been	carefully studied in the churches; one study in pittsburgh however	has illuminated the situation	2033.1156371904417
16798. in a sample of new members of pittsburgh	churches almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts	with friendly members	3017.46863782498
16799. if we add to these contacts with friendly	members the contacts with an organization of the church	then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment	is through friendly contact	3116.7461053856505
16800. on the surface this seems a sound	approach to christian mission: members of the congregation show by	their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people	respond in kind by joining the church	5767.681044479892
16801. missionary outreach	by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what	is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority	of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic	position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle	of informal relations	4755.047988232933
16802. this means that the antennae of the congregation	are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths	of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;	the mission of the church is actually a process of informal	co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people	who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation	8576.212673632424
16803. churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long	as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people	who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits	diminishes the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no	longer keep it going	4844.25267996983
16804. the transmutation of mission to co-optation	is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities	worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members	3483.627240722879
16805. the	proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts	by the clergy and friendly contacts	by members	1890.3586563472006
16806. 1 per cent of the initial contacts with	new members	560.6304080669981
16807. in general friendly contact with a member followed by	contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment	by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic	integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission	in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are	the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from	the neighborhood	5729.7683009795865
16808. the inner life of congregations will prosper so long	as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize	together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability	of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as	the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the	membership	7972.0244360202
16809. economic integration ceases when the social and economic	statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of	the congregation	2331.220757461004
16810. in a rapidly changing society congregations will run	into difficulties repeatedly since such nice balances of economic integration	are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single	generation	5002.013689855647
16811. the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations	have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred	years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle	to maintain economic balance	3550.490012330881
16812. the expense of this type of organization	in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which	deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental	questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile	society; nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregations	illumines the nature of the protestant development	7693.175633620085
16813. it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had	split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal	basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings	2973.1710067924096
16814. these trends	seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis	750.8588023067022
16815. residential	associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions	166.7239319434649
16816. the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential	communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb	negro and white blue collar and white collar can be viewed as	symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis	6432.397005936641
16817. it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved	with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to crystallize	the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings	3227.6279009474033
16818. the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the	drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations	2358.2164908550135
16819. this	conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable	environment	647.3704723175974
16820. more than creatures of metropolitan forces the	churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan	life crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of	peoples giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world	of heterogeneous peoples	6334.513751179442
16821. since american life is committed	above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the	countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have	fought a desperate rearguard action against the expanding interdependence	of the metropolis	3954.6359526598803
16822. consumer communities have suffered at the hands	of the productive interests	753.5965466869877
16823. negroes puerto ricans and rural	newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities	949.8482239413248
16824. soon they will	fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches	will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized	their history for a century	4856.99696745867
16825. the identification of the basic unit	of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a	residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply	means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian	fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation	4776.577110926798
16826. mission	to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential	community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan	interdependence with residential exclusion	3692.6423943295777
16827. this interpretation	of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could	lead to various projections for the churches	2024.306082876834
16828. it could be argued	that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed	to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the	middle classes	4466.970055052456
16829. it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain	religious activity since worship presupposes some local stabilities	1573.93863723917
16830. whatever projection one makes the striking fact about congregational	and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the	social identity of middle-class people	4483.351563574672
16831. attention will be given	in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational	churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the	communal style of the middle classes	3332.359932589403
16832. the keynotes of this style are	activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem	1403.0839129988258
16833. these	values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictating	the methods of child rearing determining the pattern of community	participation setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of	middle-class illness and informing the congregational life of the major	denominations	4536.379534116941
16834. fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly	contact form the iron cage of denominational religion	1662.4791564269588
16835. its contents	are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued	by the congregation	1251.8690618467892
16836. what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention	under the rubric of the organization church	2130.5530749765303
16837. an understanding	of the new role of residential association in an industrial society	serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of	conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity	3646.772206235009
16838. the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes	turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs	and charities should fill the same need	5013.922035702644
16839. with capital largely squandered there seemed to them no other course	to pursue	787.6972100671763
16840. the directors sold directly to concessionaires who	had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company	2809.614242806184
16841. these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt	with the indians through engages who might be habitants voyageurs	or even soldiers	2180.8182153413622
16842. the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of	one-tenth on the goods they traded and all pelts were to be taken to	company stores and shipped to france in company ships	5147.368416030995
16843. the company	disposed of the pelts but with what profit the records do not show	1099.3480185939575
16844. in accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish	presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians	2819.862852153944
16845. the lavish	use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade	of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change	in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men	3848.376209311997
16846. traders	from the english colonies were far more generous and indian loyalty	turned to them	1642.565032633983
16847. protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded	and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian	insurrections that brought ruin to the company	2582.059285276664
16848. in 1721	the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do	all that was necessary to protect the colony	3257.135815894556
16849. they ordered the raising	of troops and obtained 75000 livres with which to build forts	1090.4344107228296
16850. they	adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts	959.111007590893
16851. in each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading	depot to supply the smaller trading houses	2186.1856061045173
16852. for southeastern	louisiana	mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies	for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by british	traders	4468.322296959235
16853. mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending	northward to the sources of the tennessee river	1870.712531028255
16854. fort toulouse	on the alabama river had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas	and choctaws but money was available for only one other new	post near the present nashville tennessee and this was soon abandoned	6058.833365125962
16855. west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi	district of which new orleans was headquarters	1245.6126012953814
16856. dependent upon it	were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers	of new spain	2587.92306250095
16857. on the middle mississippi a principal	post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas	1418.623724597271
16858. it was hoped	that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west	principally down the arkansas river	3260.9823776285666
16859. on the ohio or wabash was to	be built another post at the fork of two great rivers	1563.8683133280006
16860. other	posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication	with canada	1657.9291412207635
16861. on the upper mississippi the illinois post was	to be established near kaskaskia and dependent posts were to be built	on the missouri where there are mines in abundance	3098.252133494069
16862. each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible	to a director-general at new orleans	2354.7818568970206
16863. an elaborate system of accounting	and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the	most scientific way	2172.7588417738384
16864. concessionaires were to be under the supervision	of the directors	560.191204573088
16865. engages must be loyal to the concessionaires	and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended	1724.5253310576973
16866. the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose	of their pelts to the concessionaires	2337.1237734631936
16867. only two principal storehouses	were actually established- one at mobile the other at new	orleans	1095.40664319772
16868. new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi	and west of that river and on the ohio and wabash	3289.181493307634
16869. mobile	was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district	791.1507177737184
16870. the power that bienville exercised during his first administration	cannot be determined	961.6892187533106
16871. regulations for the indian trade were	made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane and bienville	apparently did not have control of that body	2447.436247969706
16872. the conseil even	treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and	on its own authority sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable	for the peltry trade	4480.847316047795
16873. it decided also that the purely secular	efforts of bienville were insufficient and sent missionaries to	win the savages from the heathen carolinians	2323.1219491192796
16874. during the first	administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district	was a lucrative source of revenue	2592.9971524450348
16875. the alabamas brought in annually	15000 to 20000 deerskins and the choctaws and chickasaws brought	the total up to 50000 pelts	2035.3175383308076
16876. these deerskins were the raw material	for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the	tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods	4473.771606485729
16877. during his first administration bienville succeeded in keeping carolina	traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country	1715.132874091006
16878. the	director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french	goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the indian	needs	4282.507368555969
16879. the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which	goods could be moved quickly and cheaply	1421.9361248207256
16880. de la laude commander	of the alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able	to make them look upon the british as poor competitors	4282.743932030958
16881. diron d'artaguette	the most prominent trader in the district was energetic and	resourceful but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors	2467.8666191153043
16882. he became after a time commander of a post on the alabama	river but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district	and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade	5179.040022350737
16883. the	chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district	641.7345454302761
16884. their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama	the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland rivers and was	easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees	4640.988192033606
16885. in 1720 some	chickasaws massacred the french traders among them and did not	make peace for four years	1570.1282596719232
16886. venturesome traders however continued to	come to them from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelts	for the french markets	3261.9422730591045
16887. british traders from south carolina incited	the indians against the french and there developed french and	british factions in the tribe	2049.381976860255
16888. the chickasaws finally were the occasion	for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana	2120.052631780404
16889. to hold them was an essential part of french policy for they	controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile	2450.8712854679825
16890. they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region	from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french	settlements near the gulf	4488.847538827639
16891. bienville realized that if the french	were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british	goods french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant	as the carolinians and at reasonable prices	3877.2939614128277
16892. his urgings brought	some results	22.416695833364308
16893. the company of the indies promised to send over a supply	of indian trading goods and to price them more cheaply in terms	of deerskins	2597.213911451615
16894. but it coupled with this a requirement that indians	must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation	into and out of the indian country	4625.658445492633
16895. the insistence of bienville	upon giving liberal prices to the indians in order to drive	back the carolina traders was probably a factor that led to his recall	in 1724	3217.9980801038437
16896. for two years his friend and cousin boisbriant remained	as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance	3060.9922438972562
16897. although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders	and even kill some of them the carolina advance continued	2044.4368060648353
16898. the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina	and when perier came over as governor in 1727 he was given special	instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district	5348.637477970298
16899. but the	company of the indies holding to its program of economy made no arrangements	to furnish better goods at attractive prices	2183.6700412454807
16900. to the directors	the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy	970.8407887265436
16901. perier	attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among	the indians	944.4787826242178
16902. these agents were to ascertain the difference between	english and french goods and the prices charged the indians	2376.74778761157
16903. they	were to conciliate the unfriendly savages and wherever possible to	incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina	1883.5403658587002
16904. they were	to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant	supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering	4473.841963783262
16905. perier's intrigues gained some successes	14.890298082856898
16906. the savages divided	into two factions; one was british and the other french	1196.5410179920177
16907. so hostile	did these factions become that among the choctaws civil war broke	out	944.1624392209806
16908. perier's efforts however were on the whole ineffective	in winning back the tribes of the mobile district and he decided	to send troops into the troubled country	4284.775345942855
16909. he asked the government	for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest	english traders and disloyal indians	2017.8800220840299
16910. in spite of the company's	restrictions he planned to build new posts in the territory	1646.2722560930579
16911. he asked	also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians'	pelts	1256.8286951620353
16912. no help came from the crown and perier in desperation	gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d'artaguette	3268.815936602597
16913. d'artaguette went vigorously to work and gave credit to many	hunters	503.4235349134354
16914. but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts and soon	french trade in the region was at an end	3027.119871229773
16915. perier finally in one	last bid in 1730 cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent	above the cost in france	2590.967435198524
16916. the indians were not impressed and held	to the carolina traders who swarmed over the country almost to the	mississippi	2820.6294111938287
16917. with the loss of the mobile trade which ended	all profits from louisiana the natchez indians revolted	1418.4671010457307
16918. they destroyed	a trading house and pillaged the goods and harassed french shipping	on the mississippi	1899.0621927841341
16919. the war to subdue them taxed the resources	of the colony and piled up enormous debts	1256.7838279196749
16920. in january 1731 the company	asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony	2115.795841581594
16921. it stated that it had lost 20000000 livres in its operations and apparently	blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade	2174.1346083578583
16922. it offered	to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity	1182.5029432651932
16923. the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the	company at 1450000 livres	1101.560621655836
16924. thenceforth the commerce of louisiana	was free to all frenchmen	559.4468588380295
16925. company rule in louisiana left the	colony without fortifications arms munitions or supplies	791.0792205063037
16926. the difficulties	of trade had ruined many voyageurs and numbers of them	had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families	3486.461864516302
16927. others	left the country and there was no one familiar with the indian trade	944.3459036607097
16928. if this trade should be resumed the habitants who had come	to be farmers or artisans and soldiers discharged from the army must	be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois	5304.882428726043
16929. this was a	slow and difficult course and french trade suffered from the many mistakes	of the new group of traders	2037.957104020912
16930. these men were without capital or	experience	140.94574162309098
16931. perier and salmon the intendant wished either	to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown	furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts	with pelts	3657.1704757646285
16932. bienville who returned to succeed perier in 1732 objected	that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing	a trade in which they could see no hope of profits	4829.832050855207
16933. he reported too	that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability	sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king's goods	2313.1199695824066
16934. he did	find some to trust however and he employed the king's soldiers	to trade	1639.979327762837
16935. with no company to interfere he kept close control over all	the traders	789.3912014063892
16936. in order to compete with english traders bienville	radically changed the price schedule	1182.849197627977
16937. the king should expect	no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france	which would cover the expense of transportation and handling was all	he charged the traders	3660.1328833953353
16938. they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned	a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury's expense	3899.9314346317287
16939. they would be particularly displeased with the state department if	it were the source of such reports	1411.313841286459
16940. few things are more perilous for	the state department than a displeased congressman	1190.5694207071422
16941. the reason	for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends	so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are	so available	2973.614677924859
16942. first the state department is unique among government	agencies for its lack of public supporters	1640.779147947705
16943. the farmers may be aroused	if congress cuts into the agriculture department's budget	792.69164643247
16944. businessmen	will rise if congress attacks the commerce department	392.027079131875
16945. labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department; the	chamber of commerce assaults upon the treasury	1252.0004850690088
16946. a kaleidoscope of	pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly	toward the department of health education and welfare	3263.9320670908637
16947. the congressman's	patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense	department	789.0494485550504
16948. tampering with the post office may infuriate every	voter who can write	957.7244207863807
16949. with all these agencies the congressman	must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly	1425.4364930455636
16950. no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon	the state department in anger	1868.4309991466362
16951. in many sections he may even	reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson	1577.0538821376863
16952. after	all the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer the laborer	or the businessman but to foreigners	2823.258258232121
16953. not only do these foreigners	not vote for american congressmen; they are also probably	ungrateful for uncle's sam's bounty	1722.304710069208
16954. and are not the state department	men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders	who have never met a payroll	3043.4872845263462
16955. will not the righteous congressman	be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america	and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes	3661.5861787187196
16956. the chances are excellent that he will	140.6067279279772
16957. the result is	that the state department's perpetual position before congress is	the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever	the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife	3767.3383121744655
16958. people in this	position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the	newspapers	1887.2038216985318
16959. state keeps the junketeering list a secret	94.41842217296954
16960. the	department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion	962.7220950405108
16961. congress is a harsh master	14.919430039205427
16962. state is expected to arrange the	touring cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected	to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers	are expected to entertain him according to his whim frequently with	their savings for the children's college tuition	6995.292663007135
16963. but come	the next session of congress state can expect only that its summer	guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money	for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for	its diplomats	4125.357538563747
16964. the congressman who in paris may have stuffed his	wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will	systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance	for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury	6402.306057051307
16965. in the matter of money state's most unrelenting watchdog during	the eisenhower years was representative john j rooney of	brooklyn who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses	2960.0066131508024
16966. diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful	coexistence not with nikita khrushchev but with john rooney	2575.218830425626
16967. in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of	techniques they had tried to bring rooney around- friendly persuasion	groveling abasement pressure subtly exerted through other powerful	congressmen tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic	corps	3953.866417649418
16968. the trouble explained	loy henderson then deputy undersecretary for administration	is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing	it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we	do	5911.1472346789615
16969. one year the department collected a file of case histories	to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's	entertainment bills out of personal income	3088.458306745936
16970. news of the	project reached the press	141.03513534307672
16971. next day reports went through the department	that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt	to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances	and had sworn an oath that that year expense allowances would not	rise a dollar	4541.213589772518
16972. the department's constant	fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic	bloody engagements with the senate	3258.0725867849037
16973. armed with constitutional	power to negate the executive's foreign policy the senate carries	a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department's	back or on the head of the secretary of state	3963.2949844782925
16974. with	its power to investigate the senate can paralyze the secretary by	keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees as it	did with dean acheson	4471.858254643937
16975. john foster dulles escaped by keeping his	personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson who was then	operating the senate refused to let it become an inquisition	3097.9769203650967
16976. during	dulles's first two years in office while republicans ran the	senate the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for	its	blood since 1945	4465.420544907158
16977. an internal police operation managed by scott	mcleod a former fbi man installed as security officer	upon congressional insistence was part of the vengeance	2458.670260036162
16978. so was	the attack upon charles e bohlen when eisenhower appointed him	ambassador to moscow	1630.9973116706826
16979. the principal mauler however was senator	joseph mccarthy	165.71297883788014
16980. where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle	for the department dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates	2368.51658318612
16981. fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats	dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men	had their way	2176.551060708812
16982. in view of eisenhower's reluctance to concede	that anything was amiss in the terror it is doubtful that heroic intervention	by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him	and the country's foreign policy	5599.155191644279
16983. in any event the example of acheson's	trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke	it	1557.0407898490062
16984. he elected to get along	22.22250204570094
16985. during this dark chapter	in state department history men who had offered foreign-policy ideas	later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol	hill	2863.5636948117544
16986. their old errors of judgment were equated in the curious	logic of the time with present treasonous intent	2347.5127844066674
16987. their successors	absorbing the lesson made it a point to have few ideas	788.664863726953
16988. this	in turn brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats	took control	1653.5430547301614
16989. in the new style the department was berated as intellectually	barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit	the russians	2333.3047220158755
16990. for three or four years in the mid-1950's this	complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there	was a dull legislative afternoon	3906.417664167709
16991. it became smart to say that the fault	was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by	anyone but himself	2171.413407099929
16992. an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth	of new thought was created by the senate's own penchant for crucifying	anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation	4660.768885367941
16993. getting along with foreigners	there are ninety-eight foreign	embassies and legations in washington	787.2663648947658
16994. they range from the soviet	embassy on sixteenth street a gray shuttered pile suggesting a	funeral-accessories	display house to what congressman rooney has called	that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street the modern cement-and-glass	chancery of the belgians	5799.113440336223
16995. here is the world of the	chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter of caviar on stale crackers	and the warm martini of the poseur the spy the party crasher	and the patriot of the rented tails the double cross and the tired	lothario	4470.968934411665
16996. into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries	around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions	on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies	5010.249763425095
16997. here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty	the secret of the anti-missile missile or an invitation to dinner	2321.7040935021605
16998. out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting	to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington	3467.5854753107983
16999. some like the british and the french maintain an elaborate	system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special	areas of the american scene	2591.9598284575745
17000. other embassies cable home the	new york times without changing a comma	960.282427708642
17001. each has its peculiar	style	14.8099150253409
17002. the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage	headquarters	564.474062640976
17003. when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over	in 1957 from georgi zaroubin he made a determined effort to change	this idea	2024.8997896960748
17004. menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer's	grin and a hearty handclasp	969.7090906588821
17005. to everyone's astonishment he seemed	no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt	was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov	1885.4361735416303
17006. where his predecessors	had glowered menshikov smiled	140.37174596721928
17007. where they had affected the	bleak social style of embalmers' assistants menshikov went abroad	gorgeous in white tie and tails	1877.0656353014515
17008. overnight he became the most available	man in washington	389.9685096521512
17009. speeches by the soviet ambassador became the	vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club	alike	1738.0214693580615
17010. in senator joseph mccarthy's phrase it was the most	unheard-of thing ever heard of	1399.7761698048048
17011. a newspaperman who met him at a reception	swore that he asked menshikov: what should we call you	1569.2537201358787
17012. and that menshikov replied: just call me mike	250.22742520625064
17013. smilin' mike was the sobriquet washington gave him	167.6518816344547
17014. his english	was usable and he used it fearlessly	391.6744662486264
17015. toasting in champagne one	night at the embassy he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and	gaily cried: up your bottom! for a few giddy months that	coincided with one of moscow's smiling moods he was the sensation	of washington	4298.802663612756
17016. at the state department hard-bitten russian experts	complained that the capitol was out of its wits	1865.1542458233046
17017. newspaper punditry	was inspired to remind everyone that judas too had been able to	smile	1096.61068317797
17018. the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians	usually end	749.5943203734722
17019. finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable	because of domestic politics moscow resumed scowling and smilin'	mike dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional	story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west	3934.5191537547566
17020. the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs' and the most	inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians	2361.5820502217034
17021. when king saud	visited washington the overwhelming question consuming the press	was the size of his family	1411.9507492796026
17022. rumor had it that his children numbered	in the hundreds	559.6058486006419
17023. the state department was little help on this or	on much else about saudi arabia	1097.212984285653
17024. a reporter who consulted a middle	east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until	the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a	brochure published by the arabian-american oil company	5501.830434707316
17025. this	is where i get my information from he confided	374.96356124188594
17026. but bring it	right back	22.332557506498112
17027. it's the only copy i've got	43.92687798288097
17028. the size of	saud's family was still being debated when the king appeared for his	first meeting with eisenhower	2578.3492981885743
17029. when it ended a dusky sheik in desert	robes flowed into hagerty's office to report on the interview	1575.6907674328727
17030. the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american	friendship to bore in on the central question	2355.4491270004346
17031. how many	children did the king have	93.88861077244414
17032. twenty-one replied the sheik	4.4224840617297145

17035. do you mean to tell us a reporter	asked that the king has twenty-one children twenty-five of whom	are sons	1885.3163782800839
17036. the sheik smiled and murmured: that is	precisely correct	392.2532167401231
17037. the egyptians are noted for elusiveness	of language	165.26486613287534
17038. when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east	peace after israel's 1956 invasion of egypt he soon found himself	speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo a language as anarchic	as casey stengel's	5165.770665341244
17039. the reports of president nasser's pledges	which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became	increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats including the israeli	foreign minister mrs golda meir	2981.671429352936
17040. finally he reported that	nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli	concessions	2097.0953374326423

17043. of course most	toilets are eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are	raised to chair height they are actually outside toilets- inside	2578.29633517847
17044. a few newer homes have western flush toilets but even with running	water they are usually eastern style	2336.4423488435577
17045. the next day i visited	international christian college which has developed since the war	under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan	well	2847.481158783204

17050. in the afternoon miss	hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs	kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers	4474.502225750393
17051. mrs	hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about- beautiful	artistically talented an artful manager of her big household-	and yet looking like a pampered gentle japanese	woman	3249.744042767982
17052. she was a real experience! the dances were as beautiful	as anything i have ever seen- they rival the new york rockettes	for scenery and precision as well as imagination	4821.392589440863
17053. because	don was leaving the next day i spent the evening with him at asia	center	1260.8033667197083

17055. there	is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected- some think	too much	1260.061944608933
17056. there is a great deal of thought being given to	the question of moral education in the schools	2351.364727938479
17057. with the loss of the	emperor diety in japan the people are left in confusion with no god	or moral teachings that have strength	2455.135612443076
17058. the older parents continued	to teach their children traditional principles but the younger people	who have lost all faith and convictions are now parents	3677.2793151973865
17059. there seems	to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles	to give stability	1566.2036129078865
17060. as a result money is spent quickly and freely	with no thought of its value	1637.830183511323
17061. gambling is everywhere especially among	students	43.7777921478711
17062. the government	has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education	for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction	and are confused	4487.749159231971
17063. i was told that it is quite likely that japanese	soldiers would not fight again- for why should they	1714.0730572289824
17064. it will be	painful but interesting to see what kind of a god these people will	create or what strong convictions they will develop	3683.211091151066
17065. in the evening	the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the	new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good	2991.9417321469996

17069. my instructions were that mr nishimo would meet me at the hotel	but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm	welcome	2860.953198210756
17070. my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan	travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen	but it was fun for once to be elegant- i did explain to the students	however that this was not my usual style for their salaries are very	small and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well	8648.964550058126
17071. they	understood and teased me a bit about it	260.88657370949124
17072. i think i would have	been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto nara	and hiroshima	2608.6437994872476
17073. kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its	cultural center	643.465785048539
17074. it along with nara was untouched by the war-	and	is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan	3044.2354412245

17079. at 6:00 pm we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place	where these beautiful dances originated	1573.3719346122293

17087. we had tea at mr washizu's home where i learned	that he too comes from a very wealthy family	1738.9385286100733
17088. his grandfather is	a buddhist priest; and he being the eldest was supposed to be a priest	but he chose to do differently and one of his brothers is to become	the priest	5334.876998037228
17089. this is a significant fact in japan for only a few	years ago he would have had no choice	1736.8086326555215
17090. in his big home live four families	and thirty people so it needs to be big	1881.278433635924
17091. also there are housed	here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old-	paintings lacquer brocade etc	1751.3536298133827

17100. even though we had walked miles	in kyoto that day we started out again to see nara at night	2592.752473999778
17101. in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles	to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima	2588.620846455572
17102. again the plan was	for me to go alone but they wouldn't let me	1404.9525318678914

17109. but there	he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand	1094.8072158829323
17110. i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even	when i told them i didn't want to	3035.5138046858565
17111. they knew that i was still grieving	over the tragic event and they felt that if i could see the	recovery	and the spirit of the people who hold no grudge but who also	regret pearl harbor i would be happier and would understand better	a new japan	4834.733970350699
17112. there were no words to say this but there was no need	956.3361648118059
17113. the teachers of mr uno's school gave me a small gift	to thank me for coming	1249.343436909338
17114. hiroshima is a better city than it was before-	in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace	and understanding	3877.5175348306134
17115. i was grateful for their insight into my need	for this experience	641.6829599711224
17116. a better world may yet come out of hiroshima	387.11577046511627
17117. on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took	us immediately to her university the japanese women's university	2023.8370232602708
17118. this day was open house for parents day and the girls were	busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables	2592.9240861934245
17119. everything was in	an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun	502.3505823981154
17120. it was	thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese	students in a class in home planning	2830.3642552327306
17121. our masu is one of the very	few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family	functions and women's needs	2322.012276001404
17122. i am told the time will soon come when	women will find it necessary to do most of their own work and even now	it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants	5621.163045759165
17123. many	of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american	homes but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese	artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the	japanese are adopting western utility patterns	4468.329529829684
17124. at this women's	university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed	that japanese women also should be educated	3050.2917883564846
17125. even today there are	some doubts about the value of education for japanese women but this	university continues to grow and to send its students out into the	community	3106.752893579327
17126. active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus	where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they	can have their social gatherings and professional meetings	5336.424713939026
17127. as far	as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the	creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found	by educated women unafraid to break traditions	3850.251188919536
17128. masu is also	teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo	1180.3143605163837
17129. here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled	in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests	1874.3222257275131
17130. they learn how	to take care of children and sick members of the family	1408.247994991778
17131. they have model	kitchens a sick room with a model patient in bed and a nursery with	a life-like doll	1897.0925886571015
17132. although the training is only for one month it	is intensive and thorough	1187.4374912632848
17133. graduates of this maid's school are much	in demand and can always find work immediately	1095.3855834651695
17134. occasionally they return	for additional training	65.29769949322193
17135. masu's home economics training comes	into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for	the storage of cleaning materials	2032.8511471007355
17136. masu also uses the training she got	in an american home where she learned to polish furniture clean corners	and work effectively in keeping a shiny house	4300.078499368221
17137. her education in	the united states not just in a classroom but also in an american	house with an american housekeeper stands her in good stead	2729.965958149002
17138. of tokyo	after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria the kitchen	of which masu had planned mr washizu and i left to meet representatives	of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo	5653.583590622879
17139. here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could	not see but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous	in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant	4112.341469512719
17140. the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only	by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following	consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads	of certain national chain stores should of course be applauded	6468.000921652283
17141. but	for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of	a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts	contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case	3864.815553741234
17142. the suppositions	in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing	a connection between general company practice and local practice	in the south and by establishing such direct connection between the	practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york	and general company policy	7152.402676434214
17143. then the boycott would not be secondary	but a primary one	506.871458558761
17144. it would be directed against the actual location of	the unjust policy which for love's sake and for the sake of justice	must be removed and indivisible from this to the economic injury	of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy	6804.340578437028
17145. perhaps	this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire	national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire	economy to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores	in the matter of segregation	4288.276194197877
17146. such a general boycott might still be a	blunt or indiscriminating instrument and therefore of questionable	justification	2117.0783026212757
17147. action located where the evil is concentrated will prove	most decisive and is most clearly legitimate	1263.2205962229718
17148. it is true	of course that the end or objective of this action was different	1641.2697247657063
17149. the need that we not give unqualified	approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed	against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the	fact that white citizens' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation	mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical	violence	7861.813014431791
17150. an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically	opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow	humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously	brutal means	3548.6840170543874
17151. the end or aim of the action of course is also	important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community	customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person	from stepping forward to claim his legal rights eg against	negroes who register to vote in fayette county tennessee at the	present moment	8176.839390459367
17152. here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance	to those being despoiled and to legal remedies	1573.1403591788703
17153. this however	is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and	economic conflict can be war of all	against all no less than if other means are used	4824.42213091508
17154. it is clear that non-violent resistance is	a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian	morality like any other form of resistance	4081.1494021708213
17155. the language used	itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle	for victory	1572.7692899958015
17156. one of the sit-in	leaders has said: nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom	of hell can stop the march to freedom	3712.9664066882265
17157. everybody in the world today	might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom	is going to march over them	2466.65809010613
17158. the present writer certainly agrees	with that statement and would also affirm this- in the order of justice	2351.1157026027927
17159. however it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity	interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches	forward	2446.695884383455
17160. and when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice	and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental	good will	3038.1099620256323
17161. it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained	above and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent	means	2170.435523507772
17162. r b gregg has written that non-violence and good will of	the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical	jiu-jitsu to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance	5628.986874616776
17163. he	suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent	resistance of most victims would render him; and again that	the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object	of war- namely to demoralize the opponent to break his will	to destroy his confidence enthusiasm and hope	5020.186495792641
17164. in another respect	it is dissimilar for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent	only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is	based on sounder values	4820.376505656941
17165. a trial of strength however is made	quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent	resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder	values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means	men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause	4994.695193200307
17166. this makes necessary	a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of	resistance whenever this is thought to be justified	3030.967836328585
17167. the question	then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent	means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes	and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing	him	3852.02818584848
17168. here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some	causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem	insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently	5475.621379251633
17169. a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into	the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem	the more unlimited aggression	3324.3333327443675
17170. among christian groups the	mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that	the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the	christian use of all forms of pressure	5458.384675123155
17171. since the will and word of god	are for them concentrated in christlike love it seems clear to them	that non-violent resistance is quite another thing	2723.6816832053696
17172. the primary	objective of non-violence writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist	is not peace or obedience to the divine will but rather certain	desired social changes for personal or class or national advantage	5185.956344375769
17173. without agreeing with every phrase in this statement we must	certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any	form of resistance and then go on beyond the mennonite position and	affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine	the moral principles limiting resistance	4752.523172913322
17174. these principles we	have now set forth	140.72098293882772
17175. economy in the use of power needs not only to	be asserted but clearly specified; and when this is done it will	be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across	the distinction between violent and non-violent means and apply to	both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action	5140.386971169053
17176. economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a	barely	intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed	3260.3734840114867
17177. that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly	in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals	1870.6985554662465
17178. there	must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use	of means of resistance violent or non-violent	2587.86641783104
17179. the justification	in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays	down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against	whom pressure is primarily directed those upon whom it may be permitted	also to fall and those who may never be directly repressed for the	sake even of achieving some great good	5349.446096651273
17180. in these terms the economic	withdrawal of the negroes of nashville tennessee from trading	in the center city for example was clearly justified since these	distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be	singled out	5938.203314156688
17181. we may now take up for consideration a hard case	which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure	or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above	3543.2377742758677
17182. there may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken	at all this would have to be applied without discrimination	against a whole people	4275.217257623875
17183. an excellent article was published recently in	the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist	on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa	amounting to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both	the government and the people of the united states in these conditions	5113.091493436693
17184. h billions of american dollars not only from capital investors	but also from the pockets of u s taxpayers this author	states are being poured into south africa to support a system	dedicated to the oppression the persecution and the almost diabolical	exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens	not to be white	8047.819364070553
17185. both the conditions and the complicity are documented	in considerable detail	504.24656220637326
17186. this leads to the conclusion that the	fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not	apartheid shall continue	3497.7142888873445
17187. not only should this provision be enforced but	other economic and political actions might be taken which this author	believes must surely be supported by every american who values the	freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated	by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly	contribute to the enslavement of another nation	8519.12759087436
17188. northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights	and of integration	640.418886007994
17189. they have also led the nation in the direction	of a welfare state	1188.5913730870045
17190. and both in their objectives of non-discrimination	and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners	who are called bourbons	2309.4269376515235
17191. the name presumably derives from the	french royal house which never learned and never forgot; since bourbon	whiskey though of kentucky origin is at least as much favored	by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south	6211.426472678746
17192. the	nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little	understood in the north	1255.9331328773283
17193. the race problem has tended to obscure other	less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive	2351.9253089929466
17194. it is these other differences between north and south- other	that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare-	which i chiefly discuss herein	2599.288266175273
17195. i write about northern liberals	from considerable personal experience	393.1998548028207
17196. a southerner married to	a new englander i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting	town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men	and business executives of egghead tastes	3559.569666796616
17197. most of them are democrats	and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals	1659.0453223173358
17198. this	is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of	liberalism because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center	are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson who held that	the best government was the least government	4296.78509922754
17199. yet paradoxically my	liberal	friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints	1649.5012801569967
17200. when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and	democracy i find that they fall into two categories: the simpler	ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without	analysis; and the intelligent cynical ones who scornfully reply that	these things don't count any more in the world of to-day	5354.261753261659
17201. i am naive	they say to make use of such words	745.2747402656048
17202. i take this to mean	that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical	641.0472548958676
17203. - liberal	considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will	assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual	and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield	before it	4684.818037137904
17204. this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian	bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try	to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court	3119.436414834002
17205. as for states'	rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends	except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist	now only as anachronisms	4840.563956529719
17206. the american liberal may in the world	of to-day have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed	in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one	3102.772921615508
17207. why in the first place	call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors	an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over	everybody	3899.1813217387885
17208. if he attaches little importance to personal liberty	why not make this known to the world	1248.358720339626
17209. and if he is so scornful of	the rights of states why not advocate a different sort of constitution	that he could more sincerely support	3909.2002657589082
17210. i am concerned here	however with the northern liberal's attitude toward the south	793.4747599037022
17211. it	appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort	to conceal even in the presence of southern friends	3269.8710074217897
17212. his assumption	seems to be that any such friends being tolerable humans must be more	liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy	with his views	3096.9484364682635
17213. time's editor thomas griffith in his book	the waist-high culture wrote: h most of what was	different about it i found myself unsympathetic to	h	3911.1381781825307
17214. this for the liberals i know would be an understatement	376.0892387206425
17215. theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate	hatred that was directed against fascism	2576.85189348802
17216. i do not think	that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the	north	1251.9230250857358
17217. in business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere	would hardly be found	1180.9162888424755
17218. but in our case- and neither my wife nor	i have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional	outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and	come close to wrecking several more	4057.9905313554837
17219. in fact it has caused us to give	serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy	for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host	is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners	who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards	down	8189.540963231564
17220. accounts have been published of northern liberals in	the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported	universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority	view	2980.2284751143125
17221. but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected	to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in	social gatherings	3044.423551629508
17222. from my wife's experience and other sources this	seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles	1242.98353400058
17223. the strong feeling	is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among	college graduates throughout the south especially among those who	studied in the north	4295.785724147868
17224. and social relations arising out of business	ties impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visiting northerners	1567.2145013379834
17225. also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the	prevalent southern attitude on most social problems	2114.03001481195
17226. there	are of course many souths; but for this discussion the most important	division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who	haven't	2586.6974529372806
17227. my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed	rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war	3469.107657289238
17228. nobody	knows how many southerners there are in this category	371.8405066210029
17229. i suspect	that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to	believe	1644.8084570470958
17230. i never heard of a poll being taken on the question	502.5264107762479
17231. no doubt	such a thing would be considered unpatriotic	393.029354703906
17232. prior to 1954 i imagine	that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy	1255.7807657117444
17233. since the supreme court's decision of that year this is	more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following	the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would	have been for the old south	6217.808999768452
17234. belief in the traditional way of	life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones	1722.5220984970044
17235. probably	a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain	unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and	alabama following along after them	3482.4402642534124
17236. old attitudes are held more tenaciously	in the tidewater than the piedmont; so that a line running	down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater	would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course	important minority enclaves	4634.133950715992
17237. the long-settled areas of states	like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture	to its richest flowering and there the memory is more precious and	the consciousness of loss the greater	5192.402998130082
17238. also we should not even to-day	discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering	on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies	than with the north even after independence	3885.0237686611135
17239. the social and psychological	consequences of this continue to affect the area	956.4807242383322
17240. in certain	respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south	644.2470513566709
17241. poor where they had once been rich humbled where they had been	arrogant having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the	nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from	the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country	7234.873320878146
17242. and	no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia which	were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly	regretted the revolt against the crown	3334.1922629037954
17243. among bourbons	the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed	than other factors	2122.6537718217805
17244. all southerners agree that slavery had to	go; but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling	it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did	3100.3325106542043
17245. southern	resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion	and reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and negro	political control in many counties	4292.294962325729
17246. but apart from racial problems	the old unreconstructed south- to use the moderate words favored by	mr thomas griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what	is different about the civilization of the north	3668.8302058271606
17247. and this in effect	means most of modern america	392.66110969314644
17248. it is hard to see how the	situation could be otherwise	501.4050910787961
17249. and therein i feel many northerners	delude themselves about the south	761.9897730891317
17250. for one thing this is not a subject	often discussed or analyzed	643.5329640043478
17251. there seems to be almost a conspiracy	of silence veiling it	750.7533760774137
17252. i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful	thinking: don't talk about the final stages of reconstruction and	they will take care of themselves	2593.1255501737005
17253. or else the north really believes	that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come	around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart sharers	of the american dream like everybody else	6037.071073718897
17254. if the circumstances	are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be	true	1249.8462069249879
17255. the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western	world	1415.6917725276733
17256. regardless of rights and wrongs a population and an area	appropriate to a pre-world-war-1 great power have been following	conquest	ruled against their will by a neighboring people and have had	imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike	4206.303956975588
17257. and the	great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent	1186.1903656726581
17258. this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic	origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign	domination	2594.8188049454093
17259. the fact is due mainly to international wars both hot	and cold	966.2224285282824
17260. in every war of the united states since the civil war	the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country	2183.5896098959506
17261. so instead	of being tests of the south's loyalty the spanish war the	two world wars and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances	and cement reunion	4678.351969539153
17262. and there is no section of the nation more	ardent than the south in the cold war against communism	1729.6174899795471
17263. had the	situation been reversed had for instance england been the enemy in	1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england there is	little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put	on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain	7100.280661262067
17264. it	is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners	should have been as docile as they have	1886.9703419219331
17265. the north should thank its	stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not	draw false inferences therefrom	3677.8113395941937
17266. the two main charges levelled	against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social	reactionaries	1562.689928416034
17267. there is much truth in both these charges and not	many bourbons deny them	1413.8769143986178
17268. whatever their faults they are not hypocrites	93.50452332544275
17269. most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best	race in the world and that it should remain pure	3067.426998703262
17270. many northeners	believe this too but few of them will say so publicly	787.0112204338249
17271. the bourbon	economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of northern	conservatives	1414.660476186921
17272. but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed	go much further than this	788.6361075618289
17273. they believe that if the south	had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that	of modern america	3277.7906247385336
17274. as it is they consider that the north is now	reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism that in spite of its high	standard of living the american way has been proved inferior	to the english and scandinavian ways although they disapprove of the	socialistic features of the latter	4811.559834669236
17275. the south's antipathy	to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners harsh	accents lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy	and the use of leisure	4622.86211639529
17276. their own easier slower tempo is especially	dear to southerners; and i have heard many say that they are content	to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because	they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town	4672.186625330985
17277. in the past the duties of the state as sir henry maine noted	long ago were only two in number: internal order and external security	3902.0511593821807
17278. by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men	the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order	within its territorial borders	2471.5948034602516
17279. outside those limits it asserted as	against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against	the inferior peoples of the non-western world a position of	dominance	4473.306856607166
17280. it became the sole subject of international law		a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western	nations could do in the world arena	3213.320916681616
17281. reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and	nineteenth centuries	1177.6753674961487
17282. speaking generally it furthered- and still	tends to further- the interests of the western powers	1099.0916037677698
17283. the enormous	changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so	much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in	need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions	beyond the two basic tasks mentioned	above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state	responsibility either internally or externally	8535.63952595895
17284. this was particularly	true in the world arena which was an anarchical battleground characterized	by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires	2180.594134509748
17285. that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have	astonished a nineteenth-century statesman	2595.973405600051
17286. his duty was to his sovereign	and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial	boundaries was not to be contemplated	2468.8605692601327
17287. thus to cite but one	example the pax britannica of the nineteenth century whether with	the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling	world finance was strictly national in motivation however much other	nations may have incidentally benefited	6714.389306129977
17288. at the same time all suggestions that some sort of societal	responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial	state was strongly resisted	2730.76027910347
17289. social darwinism was able to stave	off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century	2127.838902851572
17290. however in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple	reasons an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has	occurred in both facets of national activity	2604.525803960781
17291. a concept of responsibility	is in process of articulation and establishment	750.3240297789523
17292. already firmly	implanted internally it is a growing factor in external matters	641.4483997241065
17293. a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned	an important corner	1421.111989903191
17294. in what has aptly been called a constitutional	revolution the basic nature of government was transformed from	one essentially negative in nature to	one with affirmative duties to perform	3110.2796717083656
17295. the positive state came	into existence	65.36556389666123
17296. for lawyers reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences	there has been a special fascination since then in the role	played by the supreme court in that transformation- the manner in	which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine	president roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious court-packing	plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that was	finally placed upon social legislation	5593.793964301485
17297. of greater importance however	is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous	consequences for the american people	3259.87990234066
17298. labor relations have been	transformed income security has become a standardized feature of political	platforms and all the many facets of the american version of	the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom	3771.8882883179817
17299. a national	consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts	are desirable as well as necessary	2132.5738745403332
17300. ratified in the republican party	victory in 1952 the positive state is now evidenced by political	campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social	legislation there should be	3326.521074065581
17301. the general acceptance of the idea	of governmental responsibility for the economic	well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant	watersheds in american constitutional history	4797.721976553199
17302. the other of	course was the civil war the conflict which a century ago insured	national unity over fragmentation	1738.454236622798
17303. a third one of at least equal and	perhaps even greater importance is now being traversed: american	immersion and involvement in world affairs	3474.046106204777
17304. internal national	responsibility now a truism need not be documented	374.86768925552144
17305. nevertheless	it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for as	will be shown below it cuts across both facets of the new concept	4269.32815561622
17306. thirty	years ago while the nation was wallowing in economic depression	the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow	natural forces to operate and cure the distress	3227.9065293504227
17307. that guiding	principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the	new deal; less than a score of years later congress enacted the	employment act of 1946 by which the national government assumed the	responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment	7125.583116044018
17308. hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through	planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution	1408.3810735071922
17309. in	1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration	came when the principle of national responsibility for local	economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility	proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief	by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted	with manpower surplus	7623.335593985185
17310. the american people have indeed come	a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961	1413.267275113747
17311. internal	national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the	industrial revolution	1414.511359262986
17312. reduced to its simplest terms it is an assumption	of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals	to cope with the rigors of the era	2976.9535773443813
17313. national responsibility for	individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or	even to the western nations	2839.8387938800834
17314. a measure of its widespread acceptance	may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists	in 1959	1875.253124470709
17315. meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international	commission of jurists a body of lawyers from the free world	the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law	to include affirmative governmental duties	5802.046648964962
17316. it is noteworthy that	the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed	former colonial nations	1880.7972262353655
17317. the rule of law historically a principle	according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal	was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of	government to promote individual welfare	5005.93380845678
17318. recognizing that the rule	of law is a dynamic concept h which should be employed not only	to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free	society the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility	to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions	under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized	5422.355519528711
17319. the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common	feature of the nations of the non-soviet world	2371.0312706100367
17320. for better or for worse	we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which	is collective responsibility for individual well-being	2322.6347939950692
17321. whether	a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility	operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more	difficult to establish	3683.872315789997
17322. the hypothesis ventured here is that it does	and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition	1252.7502207436464
17323. the content	is not the same however: rather than individual security it	is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group-	those in the free world- that is basic	4827.025357602697
17324. external national	responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of	the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability	of other friendly nations	2878.9581308031948
17325. if internal responsibility suggests acceptance	of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility	implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism	3043.680717229042
17326. reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty-	may help to reveal the contours of the new principle	1563.4746793226973
17327. in its beginnings	the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally	against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence	of such other claimants for loyalty as the church	5009.959149182399
17328. the breakup of	the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more	than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism	2457.6159446296715
17329. of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence	of the united states as an independent entity it is perhaps natural	for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest	the concept of	nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies	the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure	7886.799973780282
17330. but	it is more than that	43.43815757217439
17331. for it includes the emotional ties that bind	men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large	group of people together as a unit	4290.867832292607
17332. today as new nations rise from	the former colonial empires nationalism is one of the hurricane forces	loose in the world	2041.3762073108112
17333. almost febrile in intensity the principle has	become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that	nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm	3488.71072954988
17334. historically however	the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the	western civilizational group	1876.5873374695152
17335. by subduing disparate lesser groups	the nation has to some degree at least broadened the capacity for individual	liberty	2605.2731918947547
17336. within their confines moreover technological and	industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing	the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied	2608.7974271715934
17337. while the	pattern is uneven some having gained more than others nationalism	has in fact served the western peoples well	2828.661598243075
17338. helped the peoples of the remainder of the world and whether	today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial	it is one of the ironic quirks	of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the	territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that	the nation-state attained its highest number	5235.323034889662
17339. but	it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is	no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the	planet	4303.053621224435
17340. in other words nationalism worked well enough when it had	limited application both as to geography and as to population; it	becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis	3336.907891231274
17341. complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal	principle of sovereignty	955.6937075628751
17342. the former receives its legitimacy from the	latter	167.156243109172
17343. operating side by side together they helped shore up the nation-state	747.4719118210188
17344. while sovereignty has roots in antiquity in its present	usage it is essentially modern	937.3317099724578
17345. jean bodin writing in the sixteenth	century may have been the seminal thinker but it was the vastly influential	john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now	understood	5334.967021940749
17346. austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty	still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking	1246.2095523907697
17347. to	him law is the command of the sovereign who	personifies the power of the nation while sovereignty is the power to	make law- ie to prevail over internal groups and to be free	from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations	6690.557330169353
17348. these fundamental	ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual	aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate	political power	2162.9031866383793
17349. the nation-state then exemplifies the principle	of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over	domestic affairs and independence from outside control	3046.0002504374906
17350. in fact however	both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined	643.6093590400521
17351. high-level	abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision	558.9561468237259
17352. that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic	societies in which popular sovereignty is said to exist	and in federal nations in which the jobs of government are split	3532.044738134731
17353. nevertheless	nationalism and sovereignty are reputed in the accepted	wisdom to describe the modern world	1656.3520634460147
17354. is there a different reality behind	the facade	167.13288873826585
17355. does the surface hide a quite different picture	249.92809075344448
17356. the short answer to those questions is yes	167.57871277919634
17357. both concepts	are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted	by a concept of national responsibility	2353.4643635251414
17358. as evidence to support	that view consider the following illustrative instances	506.38356510579143
17359. can thermonuclear war be set off by accident	250.90387721169455
17360. what steps have been	taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the	destruction of continents	1876.2386776074861
17361. are we as safe as we should be from such	a disaster	964.7802719818762
17362. is anything being done to increase our margin of safety	374.378920019302
17363. will the danger increase or decrease	65.5654358997092
17364. i have just asked	these questions in the pentagon in the white house in offices of	key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl	for months underwater with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain	polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as sherwood	forest	4890.012975750722
17365. i asked the same questions inside the launch-control	rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officers who wear	sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war-	accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other	pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons	7526.447520336032
17366. to	the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits submarine compartments	and the antiseptic windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of	tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars the questions seem farfetched	3107.850775950996
17367. there is unceasing pressure but its sources are immediate	390.55558309028345
17368. readiness exercises are almost continuous	14.743476428736653
17369. each could be the real	thing	65.66898004200019
17370. in the command centers there are special clocks ready	to tick off the minutes elapsed since e hour	1576.310646350115
17371. e	stands for execution- the moment a go order would unleash	an american nuclear strike	1658.960733078001
17372. there is little time for the men in the	command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks	1729.4735359463891
17373. they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches flashing	colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business	machines	3499.589062011916
17374. they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical	details	261.192381392665
17375. accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people	who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so	they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks	5314.897685335462
17376. among	the policy makers generals physicists psychologists and others	charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their	hardware the answers to my questions varied partly according to	a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios	4400.570471730057
17377. as an air force psychiatrist put it: you can't have	dry runs on this one	1665.6602341347086
17378. the experts are thus forced to hypothesize	sequences of events that have never occurred probably never will-	but possibly might	1877.3041101637234
17379. only one rule prevailed in my conversations with	these men: the more highly placed they are- that is the more they	know- the more concerned they have become	4486.368718750035
17380. already accidental	war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration	about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions	of national security	2880.058094225499
17381. only recently new holes were	discovered in our safety measures and a search is now on for more	2360.9671356747867
17382. work	is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed	on all nuclear weapons	1414.7348502895852
17383. meanwhile the experts speak of	wars triggered by false pre-emption escalation unauthorized	behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report	3436.466133138828
17384. they inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold	phones	644.4491535736213
17385. their conversations were almost invariably accompanied	by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward	each other in arclike semicircular motions	3268.2733303515392
17386. one arm represented our bombers	and missiles the other arm theirs	503.46341157555435
17387. yet implicit in each	movement was the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps	you and me- and the experts	3033.387562532605
17388. these men are not callous	14.739353870429252
17389. it is their job to think about the unthinkable	393.0874424662993
17390. unanimously they believe	that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more	russians and communist chinese too- thought about accidental	war	2741.8446335985304
17391. the first systematic thinking about this pandora's box	within pandora's boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle a	frail meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist	3713.233886488327
17392. he was and is with the	rand corporation a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the	u s air force	1886.6313070627457
17393. his investigations made him the paul revere	of accidental war and safety procedures were enormously increased	1875.0922319880278
17394. in recent weeks as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal	by the kennedy administration basic united states strategy	has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war	danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible	4321.262803802935
17395. the	chain starts at bmews	in thule greenland	249.7535998843467
17396. its radar screens would register soviet	missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states	1259.6129860085211
17397. bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad	in colorado springs	colorado for interpretation; to the sac command and control	post forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base near	omaha nebraska; to the joint war room of the joint chiefs	of staff in the pentagon and to the president	7541.182403666229
17398. telephones	teletypes several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television	link all vital points	1248.9852039281643
17399. alternate locations exist for all key command	centers	250.49048960112705
17400. for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command	posts on kc-135 jet tankers	643.8585098667775
17401. multiple circuits routings and	frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible	964.029766285745
17402. the	same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these	special networks	786.33532004522
17403. and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits	until senders and receivers authenticate in advance by special	codes	that the messages actually come from their purported sources	4486.008262933321
17404. additional	codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications	502.5423098241037
17405. only the president is permitted to authorize the	use of nuclear weapons	963.6841625089795
17406. but what if somebody decides	to break it	165.29126183068803
17407. the president cannot personally remove the safety	devices from every nuclear trigger	968.0169133108327
17408. he makes the momentous decision	14.742586012204043
17409. hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers	and to push the buttons	2363.1602424614016
17410. what if one or more of them turn irrational	or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the russians	1419.9012943380017
17411. what if the president	himself in the language of the military goes ape	1182.529257229751
17412. or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets	without provocation	786.8045903723615
17413. nobody can be absolutely certain of	the answers	250.61594868467006
17414. however the system is designed ingeniously and hopefully	so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war	1578.0086222976272
17415. even	the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order	1190.7370065410155
17416. even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the	go code	1109.7753981718731
17417. in an emergency he would receive available intelligence	on the gold-phone circuit	966.639673651766
17418. a system of gold- actually	yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of	the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the sac	commander and other key men	3454.600263984782
17419. all can be connected with the gold circuit	from their homes	752.2388544926969
17420. all could help the president make his decision	166.51275823746957
17421. the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble	960.6100908230286
17422. vital	questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda	500.6804188828452
17423. officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured	me that the president's decision could be made and announced on the	gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from bmews	5031.900909087917
17424. if communications work his decision would be instantly known	in all command posts that would originate the actual go order	1882.0187986601336
17425. for	these centers too are on the gold circuit	392.6411243341257
17426. they include the navy's	atlantic command at norfolk virginia which is in contact with	the polaris subs; nato headquarters in europe; air force	forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control	tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and sac which controls	long-range bombers and atlas missiles	4884.886316580457
17427. let us look in on	one of these nerve centers- sac at omaha- and see what must	still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their h-bombs	4653.133109759482
17428. the key man almost certainly would	be col william w wisman sac's senior controller	946.4910545492997
17429. he	or his deputy or one of their seven assistants all full colonels	mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day	3685.986652224299
17430. it is a quiet	but impressive room- 140 feet long thirty-nine feet wide twenty-one	feet high	1246.976549132964
17431. movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts	are crammed with intelligence information	965.4685603008863
17432. and bill wisman forty-three	a farmer's son from beallsville ohio is a quiet but impressive	man	1259.499653553277
17433. his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown	393.4950783785807
17434. his movements	and speech are precise clear and quick	262.0157541815369
17435. no question ruffles him	or causes him to hesitate	395.46961861975825
17436. wisman who has had the chief controller's	job for four years calls the signals for a team operating	three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights switches and buttons	3101.2736970248347
17437. at least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him	1189.4051193322264
17438. in front of him is a gold phone	168.13605756759011
17439. in emergencies the sac commander	gen thomas power or his deputies and their staff would occupy	a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman	and his staff	5021.847047306497
17440. at general power's seat in the balcony there is	also a gold phone	787.4424718805033
17441. general power would participate in the decision	making	250.0503288585456
17442. wisman below would listen in and act	94.04503645155604
17443. his consoles can give	him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and	with every sac aircraft	2847.0444788514415
17444. he need only pick up one of	the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left right next to the	big red button marked alert	2604.0420296648285
17445. but wisman too does not	know the go code	394.7408008591761
17446. he must take it from the red box	167.5628814206197
17447. in point	of fact this is a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half	feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to	wisman's right	5662.427898222169
17448. the box is internally wired so the door can never	be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon	1574.5007886931428
17449. now we must become vague for we are approaching	one of the nation's most guarded secrets	1881.2881950610213
17450. the codes in the red box-	there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained	in a sealed x-ray-proof unique device	2173.1492736798627
17451. they are supplied	a batch at a time by a secret source and are continually changed	by wisman or his staff at random intervals	3715.320225306201
17452. but even the contents	of wisman's box cannot start a war	502.94719742823224
17453. they are mere fragments	just one portion of preprepared messages	564.675339721306
17454. what these fragments are	and how they activate the go order may not be revealed	1095.8055958999817
17455. the pieces must	be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman's staff	1647.6650343473
17456. in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures	which precede and follow the sending of the go messages again in special	codes each message also contains an internal authenticator	another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting	the real thing	4462.061809733229
17457. i asked wisman what would happen if he broke	out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one	2603.018257964107
17458. i'd wind	up full of 	7.181605974152741
17459. 38 bullet holes he said and there was no question that	he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers	2806.4430301979883
17460. now let	us imagine a wing of b-52's on alert near their positive control	points the spots on the map many miles from	soviet territory beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific	orders to proceed to their targets	4223.135064701509
17461. they too have fragments of	the go code with them	562.8298206811489
17462. as wisman put it they have separate pieces	of the pie and we have the whole pie	1416.2159809249142
17463. once we send out the whole	pie they can put their pieces into it	1417.0989140841682
17464. unless we send out the whole	pie their pieces mean nothing	504.0774307462751
17465. why does wisman's ever-changing	code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers	1889.2621710912003
17466. the answer is a cryptographic secret	43.78753690052241
17467. at any rate three	men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman's	go-to-war message	2585.006565283455
17468. each must match wisman's pie with the	fragment that he carries with him	789.8187623435558
17469. all three must compare notes and agree	to go	392.92882051674655
17470. after that it requires several minutes of concentrated	work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum	of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber each	with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released	4524.808911667452
17471. unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals	from the handles removed first- no damage can be done	3061.609781735098
17472. suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended	261.25489387509504
17473. they	went as rigid as black statuary h six figures lean and tall and	angular went still	2113.4362374382154
17474. their heads were in the air sniffing	93.47508842292208
17475. they all	swung at the same instant in the same direction	749.8393864767634
17476. they saw it before	i did even with my binoculars	373.05450720573936
17477. it was nothing more than a tiny distant	rain squall a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds	to the earth	3675.954970913972
17478. in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree	no more	791.4098470053681
17479. a white man would not have seen it	250.4957124647447
17480. the aborigines fastened	upon it with a concentration beyond pathos	372.319109282695
17481. watching they waited	until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant	across the dry burning land	3036.627673396296
17482. at once the whole band set off at a lope	374.53294740545505
17483. they were chasing a rain cloud	65.40842346586892
17484. they went after the squall	as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow	1109.8621372039345
17485. i followed them	in the jeep and now they did not care	957.34137961215
17486. the games were over this	was life	93.74953128868263
17487. occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly	alter the angle of their trot	2118.698746054891
17488. sometimes i guessed it was because	the rain squall had changed direction	637.3395548307304
17489. sometimes it was to skirt	a gulley	140.11163412349805
17490. their gait is impossible to convey in words	166.271998348023
17491. it has nothing	of the proud stride of the trained runner about it it is not a lope	it is not done with style or verve	4088.7640157900305
17492. it is the gait of the human who	must run to live: arms dangling legs barely swinging over the ground	head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target	a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully	graceful	4686.9250187712505
17493. it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground	389.97921479653684
17494. they ran for three hours	14.824661022149272
17495. finally avoiding hummocks and seeking low	ground they intercepted the rain squall	958.4980291492791
17496. for ten minutes they ran	beneath the squall raising their arms and for the first time shouting	and capering	1727.639791036075
17497. then the wind died and the rain squall held steady	558.9154570367558
17498. they were studying the ground	14.858942461338009
17499. suddenly one of them shouted ran a	few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground	2356.3953333694294
17500. he had found	a depression with rain water in it	372.1833853383829
17501. he bent down a black cranelike figure	and put his mouth to the ground	1418.0796000389832
17502. with a lordly and generous	gesture	the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows	1566.9028237626592
17503. the	other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle	562.1498838797864
17504. in an instant	he had sucked it dry	169.09014678968884
17505. the aborigine lives on the cruelest land	i have ever seen	755.8504059793725
17506. which does not mean that it is ugly	166.722710222154
17507. part of it	is of course	65.29266177845791
17508. there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which	are hideous	639.8886253930096
17509. they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so	many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare ridges	fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty	feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand	7521.573063109483
17510. such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality	93.2373975418782
17511. but much of the land	which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable	1890.9494012110117
17512. it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush has a peaceful quality	the hills roll softly	1429.5111443635142
17513. the malignancy of such a landscape	has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean	1651.960220052685
17514. he	tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock	a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer	2322.73634956333
17515. they went well-equipped	with everything except knowledge of the outback country	749.943323191849
17516. the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle	slopes and soft gray tree-clumps	1101.4120920322189
17517. nothing appalling or horrible rushed	upon these men	251.3735391914031
17518. there might have	been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only-	there was not	1569.5704572243762
17519. it might have rained any time; only- it did not	557.39212526726
17520. there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise;	only- there was not	1581.8719297955474
17521. they lay with the birds hopping from branch	to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them	2826.481586134643
17522. the white men died	2.9616783802071502
17523. and countless others like them have	died	140.68840779249496
17524. even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of	men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly	lost direction were tortured by the heat driven mad by the constant	and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally died	4517.406330591206
17525. the aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard	and pitiless	1413.330830483928
17526. he knows that the economy of life in the outback	is awful	642.8067467122612
17527. there is no room for error or waste	251.69915069213317
17528. any organism that falters	or misperceives the signals or weakens is done	651.9336324119283
17529. i do not know	if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but	i suspect that it can	3474.8853287474253
17530. perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his	odd air of dignity	637.4196246176024
17531. seeing an aborigine	today is a difficult thing	251.7694621189167
17532. many of them have drifted into the	cities and towns and seaports	646.2619875247814
17533. others are confined to vast reservations	and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish	them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo but on their reservations they	are extremely fugitive shunning camps coming together only for corroborees	at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch-	which is very low indeed	7869.100837860587
17534. i persuaded an australian friend	who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines	living in the bush	2174.140444086615
17535. it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation	even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge	of the aborigines and their language	4281.714705578058
17536. finally however the arrangements	were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover	1421.7084204134624
17537. we	followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a	smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth	4482.768051697397
17538. the rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big	red boulder swung off the road	2046.015063927127
17539. at once he started to glance toward	the instrument panel	563.461180670611
17540. it took me a moment to realize what was odd	about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it which rocked	gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about	3560.0054640023527
17541. the rancher	was navigating his way across the flatland	389.50530653107194
17542. do you always	navigate like this	43.69589183807965
17543. i asked	0.30041514999999996
17544. once i get out on the flat i do	262.1910473794749
17545. some chaps that know an	area well can make their way by landmarks h a tree here a wash here	a boulder there	3492.6853437489603
17546. but if you don't know the place like the palm of	your hand you'd better use a compass and the speedometer	2037.0225553269877
17547. two miles	northeast then five miles southwest h that sort of thing	960.3916279721219
17548. the landscape kept repeating itself	14.89130867516817
17549. i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was	hopeless	1634.5532693319744
17550. finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines	167.94686771487716
17551. they	were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man his lubra	and two children	1646.3906691637817
17552. the sun was not yet high and all of them were in	the small area	of shade cast by the boulder	2013.9102917059486
17553. there was also a dog	a dingo dog	251.10251469539315
17554. its ribs showed it was a yellow nondescript color	it suffered from a variety of sores hair had scabbed off its body in	patches	2462.40712971132
17555. it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving	watching us carefully	1884.3119726703685
17556. it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished	dog	510.0388436655413
17557. no one patted the dog	22.308630409096015
17558. it was not a pet	14.851668467770656
17559. the buggers love shade the rancher said	140.67273002550158
17560. i suppose	because it saves them some loss of body water	499.79329453437884
17561. they'll move around	that rock all day following the shade	560.5968162470749
17562. during the hottest part of	the day of course the sun comes straight down and there isn't any	shade	1729.6208691111883
17563. we drove close to the boulder stopped the land rover	and walked over toward the family	1897.1784128974552
17564. the man was leaning against	the rock	94.53514814001052
17565. he gazed away from us as we approached	251.9338205222091
17566. he was over	six feet tall and very thin	261.97968887742934
17567. his legs were narrow and very long	140.66373154601848
17568. every	bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance	of starving	1410.8334293757205
17569. he had long black hair and a wispy beard	396.02979154163313
17570. the ridges	over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut	783.5177870692144
17571. there was something	about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds	to realize what	2100.1189603896883
17572. it was not merely that flies were crawling over his	face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into	his eye sockets	2716.273925384038
17573. a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead into	the socket of the eye walk along the man's lashes and across the wet	surface of the eyeball and the eye did not blink	5333.0490773117945
17574. the australian	and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered	by insects but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine	2726.5223690211596
17575. i turned to look at the lubra	140.61826978359923
17576. she remained squatting on her heels	all the time we were there; like the man she was entirely naked	1711.832873785345
17577. her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family	possessions which were placed in front of her	3027.8750073850947
17578. there were two rubbing	sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like knives a woven-root	container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead	body of some rodent	3455.1133376564567
17579. there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera	a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity	and high accuracy	3519.8646183440055
17580. there was also a boomerang elaborately carved	94.3975470080923
17581. everything	was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects	seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless	4090.3783962381613
17582. the two children both boys wandered around the australian	and me for a few moments and then returned to their work	2044.507646989689
17583. they squatted	on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only	a few inches from the ground	2825.9608357888155
17584. they had located the runway of a colony	of ants and as the ants came out of the ground the boys picked them	up one at a time and pinched them dead	3456.0455651578086
17585. the tiny bodies dropped onto	a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple	2145.3715449085894
17586. the odor	here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines	786.657878980362
17587. the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant	395.1222384463038
17588. it was also	subtly familiar for it was the odor of the human body but multiplied	innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed	2848.623523547306
17589. one's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant	1186.5643354097201
17590. but that is a cliche and a dishonest one	263.83690737482965
17591. the smell is sexual but	so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it	1642.9441667882534
17592. their	skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost	the consistency of a second skin	2032.0449662669296
17593. they roll at night in ashes to keep	warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it	2814.476218695099
17594. in spots	such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized	the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating	of sweat dirt and ashes were a cosmetic	3962.071982694114
17595. the boys had beautiful	dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies	and blinked their eyes	2822.7505406401715
17596. that smell is something eh mate	43.65564483346944
17597. the australian asked	0.30041514999999996
17598. they swear that every person smells	different and every family smells different from every other	1105.75557772317
17599. at the	corroborees when they get to dancing and sweating you'll see	them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good	smell	4065.046492760039
17600. idje here and he nodded at the man is said to have	great odor	943.6133633667139
17601. the stink is all the same to me but i really think they	can make one another out blindfolded	2572.6001317057858
17602. here idje you	fella like tabac	43.62509373296805
17603. he said sharply	0.30041514999999996
17604. idje still stared over our shoulders	at the horizon	261.3297007648781
17605. the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin	i could understand and spoke strange words from deep in his chest	2831.6185087245985
17606. it was a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth	century was a great period in persian art	1874.1547676318046
17607. the architects the tile	and carpet makers the potters painters calligraphers and metalsmiths	worked through abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich	the city	4079.75421821705
17608. travelers entering from the desert were confounded by	what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales	and roses cut by canals and terraced promenades studded with	water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening	blue curves of a hundred domes	4730.867534141607
17609. at the heart of all of this was the square	which one such traveler declared to be as spacious as pleasant	and aromatick a market as any in the universe	4819.207592639604
17610. in time isfahan	came to be known as half the world isfahan nisf-i-jahan	793.2266072736658
17611. in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the	size of london started to decline	1873.9255691951053
17612. the afghans invaded; the safavids	fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached	1106.7115414542898
17613. isfahan became more of a legend than a place and now it is	for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of	old persia and sometimes of the east	5337.544096809561
17614. they think of it as a kind of	spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor	2167.556046615449
17615. those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky	at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight	2808.6094900452645
17616. but even for them it	remains a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb	a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead	3212.3910619914477
17617. everyone	is ready to grant the persians their history but almost no one is	willing to acknowledge their present	2590.4527259122365
17618. it seems that for persia and	especially for this city there are only two times: the glorious past	and the corrupt depressing sterile present	2463.613213975547
17619. the one apparent connection	between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other	have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments	4099.966241926273
17620. however just as all the buildings have not fallen and	flowed back to their original mud so the values which wanted them	and saw that they were built have not all disappeared	3431.6890695998727
17621. the values and	talents which made the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature	continue in certain social institutions which rise above the	ordinary life of this city as the great buildings rise above blank walls	and dirty lanes	6683.194845352063
17622. often too the social institutions are housed	in these pavilions and palaces and bridges for these great structures	are not simply historical monuments; they are the places where	persians live	3247.6974335068526
17623. the promenade for example continues to take	place on the chahar bagh a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees	that now serves as the city's principal street	4500.218269537067
17624. 	0.20041515
17625. t takes place	as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge	and also in the gardens of the square	3712.937807356582
17626. on fridays the day when	many persians relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not	it is true stream into chehel sotun- a pavilion and garden built	by shah abbas 2 in the seventeenth century- but they do retire	into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley	which are smaller more humble copies of the former	5633.731359608582
17627. and of course	religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques and commercial	life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar	3698.59865804094
17628. but more important	and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often	do not see is that these places and activities are often the settings	in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities	5803.624783098528
17629. water air fruit poetry music the human form- these things	are important to persians and they experience them with an intense	and discriminating awareness	2470.8123176490453
17630. i should like by the way to make	it clear that i am not using the word persians carelessly	2583.5449465066417
17631. i don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations like	a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool	2462.746823441054
17632. these things	are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to	the most ordinary	1870.2947941694565
17633. the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's	night are as often as not the lutihaw mustachioed toughs	who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons brothels	and teahouses	3945.4951450869094
17634. a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord	who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring	famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor	5630.365994481174
17635. not long	ago an acquaintance a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw	of the city stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks	3105.3954288994064
17636. the air he said was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly	good	1186.2076730873412
17637. i really didn't know what he meant	93.75057166621266
17638. it was a nice day	granted	65.67057132449169
17639. but he knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his	lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage	2041.9398258770677
17640. the natural world	then plus poetry and some kinds of art receives from the most ordinary	of persians a great deal of attention	3481.6093406961677
17641. the line of an eyebrow	the color of the skin a ghazal from hafiz the purity of spring water	the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of	a pavilion- these things are noticed judged and valued	4236.213844189407
17642. nowhere	in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so	well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge	3265.583938026781
17643. there has probably	always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the	city	1413.3974407536484
17644. for one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river	bed; for another it was here that one of the old caravan routes came	in	4465.048729875561
17645. it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans	and also to make a pleasance for the city that shah abbas 2	in about 1657 built of sun-baked brick tile and stone the present	bridge	4042.6477126787713
17646. it is a splendid structure	22.26727693296738
17647. from upstream it looks like a	long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream where the	water level is much lower it is a high elaborately facaded pavilion	3109.87590174294
17648. the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from	each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile	2578.567489964564
17649. at either end and	in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed	and capacious as church apses	2188.208029064529
17650. here in the old days- when they	had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and	his court while priests soldiers and other members of the party lounged	in the smaller alcoves between	6049.393167099677
17651. below twenty vaults tunnel	through the understructure of the bridge	373.1272597264741
17652. these are traversed by	another line of vaults and thus rooms arched on all four sides are	formed	2340.1778713979784
17653. down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing	vista like a visual echo of piers and arches while the vaults fronting	upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountains and	river pools	4052.6416976626583
17654. here on the hottest day it is cool beneath the stone	and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the	vaults	4122.939113306826
17655. on the downstream or pavilion side these vaults	give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself	1738.849346085126
17656. from the	terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the	water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river	4093.9949489627697
17657. out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a	bridge	1099.3858027024582
17658. on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops	and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge	3476.0567165441144
17659. it	is a great spectacle	14.78518997078369
17660. the bridge itself rises up from the river light-flared	and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera	2614.1287964831677
17661. crowds	press along the terraces down the steps in and out of the arcades	massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege	2609.7453495251066
17662. all kinds	come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering	over a deal; a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes	who stand with the stillness of the blind their eyes filmed with	rheum and visions; the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient	limousines; students civil servants beggars musicians hawkers	and clowns	8129.603816253546
17663. families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on	carpets around a samovar	1263.2608354422882
17664. below people line the steps as though on	bleachers to watch the sky and river	1656.58830804456
17665. above in the tiled prosceniums	of the alcoves boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi while at	the very bottom in the vaults the toughs and blades of the city hoot	and bang their drums drink arak play dice and dance	4384.361915114168
17666. here	in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important	to them: poetry water the moon a beautiful face	3258.3459244072833
17667. to a stranger	their delight in these things may seem paradoxical for persians chase	the golden calf as much as any people	2185.424984746839
17668. many of them moreover are	beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to	ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant	4666.729641644921
17669. nonetheless they take time out- much time- from the game of	grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks	2464.7475429974997
17670. above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere	to hear or quote some poetry	2119.204975273159
17671. poetry in persian life is far	more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by	antagonisms- all may stand	2315.162773343482
17672. it contains in fact their whole outlook	on life	392.82769484932436
17673. and it is expressed at least to their taste in a perfect	form	791.3098782876777
17674. poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty	752.7113828765865
17675. in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the	libraries and museums	1257.494021287196
17676. in persia where practically speaking there	are no museums or libraries or for that matter hardly any books the	twins run free	3270.739186409685
17677. it is perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine	that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end	will gather to sing marlowe herrick shakespeare and perhaps some	lyrics of their own	3656.6518288444704
17678. that at any rate is what happens at the khaju	bridge	747.8429275927982
17679. boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the	top arcade	1106.0085203142344
17680. here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to	the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they	may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian	music is divided	6442.767990017173
17681. each mode is believed to have a specific attribute-	one inducing pleasure another generosity another love and so	on to include all of the emotions	2595.7979595453307
17682. the singer simply matches the poem	to a mode; for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk	poem: they brought me news that spring is in the plains and	ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; go tell his aged mother	that her son fought with a thousand foes and he was one	7788.90469903878
17683. or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: know	ye fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth that	here with dust upon his eyes iraj the sweet-tongued singer lies	4036.4835634558185
17684. in this true lover's tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred	h	1190.1431763193339
17685. these songs	are limited to a range of two octaves	374.2626097704988
17686. yet within this	limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as	that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the painted	or woven line often flowing into an arabesque	5512.105491596032
17687. die frist ist um und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr the	maestro quoted the flying dutchman as he told of his career	and wanderings explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred	in his life several times	3956.4118288703385
17688. the music director of the pittsburgh	symphony orchestra william steinberg has molded his group	into a prominent musical organization which is his life	3500.6610103452804
17689. when he	added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london	philharmonic orchestra in 1958 he conducted one hundred fifty concerts	within nine months commuting between the two cities	3222.475260953758
17690. this	schedule became too strenuous even for the energetic and conscientious	mr steinberg	1189.8353597156201
17691. his london contract was rescinded and now he	explains cheerfully as a bright smile lightens his intense mobile face	i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts!   our	meeting took place in may 1961 during one of the maestro's stop-overs	in new york before he left for europe	4832.132643306568
17692. as we began to converse	in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel his restlessness and	sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent	3691.1913662169254
17693. seeking	an obscure dark relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise	suffused with afternoon sunshine he asked if the soft background music	could be turned off	2869.6164227539984
17694. unfortunately it was muzak which automatically	is piped into the public rooms and which nolens volens had to	be endured	2836.5720779687363
17695. as he talked about himself time and again stuffing and	dragging on his pipe steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried	feeling grew faint and was dispelled	2997.003756605483
17696. did he come from a musical	family	141.03676518774324
17697. yes: though not professional musicians they were a	music-loving family	372.19918067060655
17698. in his native cologne where his mother taught	him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the	alphabet	3684.9455714251562
17699. she even devised a system of colors whereby the boy could	easily distinguish the different note values	1417.1804474813403
17700. when he started school	at the age of five-and-a-half he could not understand why the alphabet	begins with the letter a instead of c as in the scale	4492.472247171512
17701. because	like many other children he intensely disliked practicing czerny	etudes he composed his own studies	1263.430276853784
17702. when he was eight he began	violin lessons	251.02243950582388
17703. soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra	and during world war 1 when musicians were scarce he	joined the opera orchestra as well	2598.0675842796413
17704. steinberg claims that these early	years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career	1885.0298180740424
17705. by observing the conductor he says with a twinkle in his	eyes i learned how not to conduct	1565.741307493236
17706. the musician ran away	from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him	from the gymnasium	2818.4399177218265
17707. simultaneously he pursued his musical studies	at the conservatory receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony	as well in the violin and piano	2321.3738574048284
17708. his professional career began when	he was twenty; he became otto klemperer's personal assistant	at the cologne opera and a year later was promoted to the position	of regular conductor	4803.044692993054
17709. wasn't this an unusually young age to	fill such a responsible post	644.1302403741654
17710. yes the maestro assented	4.42320304421935
17711. had	he always wished to be a conductor	167.1779264062779
17712. no originally he had hoped	to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such	1900.037085133889
17713. however	when he assumed the duties of a conductor he relinquished his career	as a pianist	1267.5946622907802
17714. five years were spent with the cologne opera	after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky teacher	of arnold scho^nberg and erich korngold	4093.155291591692

17716. during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin	state opera	1186.1655468585172
17717. two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera	where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the	rise of the hitler regime	2842.353120075033
17718. during these years the youthful conductor	had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany	2358.5261549416105
17719. he had presented the first german performances of puccini's	manon lescaut and de falla's	la vida breve	1417.6494041348094
17720. the frankfurt	years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg's	wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber	and the world premiere of scho^nberg's von heute auf morgen	4850.208664155127
17721. at the outset of his career steinberg had dedicated himself to the	advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a scho^nberg work	every year	2601.0800596105983
17722. in frankfurt too he directed the museum and opera	house concerts which in addition to the standard repertoire featured	novelties like erdmann's piano concerto and mahler's sixth	symphony	4457.1054129504455
17723. because of the political upheaval in germany in the	1930's	steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish	community	2008.8495579190053

17728. in 1938 at the insistence	of arturo toscanini steinberg left germany for the united states	by way of switzerland	2579.614576718207
17729. after he had spent the first three years	in new york as associate conductor at toscanini's invitation of	the nbc orchestra he made numerous guest appearances throughout	the united states and latin america	3562.805324099768
17730. in 1945 he became conductor	of the buffalo philharmonic	391.04702026811486
17731. seven years later he was asked to become	director of the pittsburgh symphony	783.0960228602569
17732. since 1944 he has also conducted	regularly at the san francisco opera where he made his debut	with a memorable performance of verdi's falstaff	3686.6416308967828
17733. in recent	years he has traveled widely in europe conducting in italy france	austria and switzerland	1253.6485878906328
17734. he returned to germany for the first	time in 1953 where he has since conducted in cologne frankfurt	and berlin	2812.95311107505
17735. where in europe was he going now	93.59355199419232
17736. first	of all to italy for a short vacation- forte dei marmi a place	he loves	1896.7030092165066
17737. since it is not far from viareggio he will visit puccini's	house as he never fails to do to pay his respects to the memory	of the composer of la boheme which he considers one of puccini's	masterpieces	4047.409774247859
17738. steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about	italy: rome is my second home	1184.2073764343318
17739. i consider it the center of the	world and make it a point to be there once a year	1729.119003724841
17740. he will conduct	two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia as well as concerts	in munich and cologne	2594.058642548966
17741. then i return to the united states	for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia he	added	1570.296660888638
17742. the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to	be of unusual interest	955.290794823971
17743. there will be premieres of new works made possible	through ford foundation commissions: carlisle floyd's mystery	with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist	2175.5688673389295
17744. other world premieres	will be gardner read's third symphony and burle marx's	samba concertante	1420.4075107125007
17745. and next year we will do- also	a ford commission- a piano concerto by elliott carter with jacob	lateiner as soloist	2038.4498856851164
17746. of course i shall conduct mahler and bruckner	works in the coming season as usual	1652.2136308790555
17747. we'll play bruckner's	fifth symphony in the original version and mahler's seventh-	the least accessible known and played of mahler's works	2034.5970059708711
17748. my pittsburghers	have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner	562.8387137194263
17749. he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters	on tour especially mahler's first and fourth symphonies and	das lied von der erde and bruckner's sixth- which is rarely	played- and seventh	3779.1563918366965
17750. bruckner's eighth he refers to as my	travel symphony	392.0396404305532
17751. he recalled that in california after a critic	had attacked him for still trying to sell bruckner to the americans	the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation	3339.562472920678
17752. now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and	my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us i am probably	the only one- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein-	who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner	and mahler	7020.225491082141
17753. since he introduces so much modern music	i could not resist asking how he felt about it	1411.325129346476
17754. there was	always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era	in which it was created	2812.9118284
17755. but i usually stick to the old phrase:	'ich habe ein amt aber keine meinung		642.6647729078926
17756. i consider it to be my	job to expose the public to what is being written today	2118.1784649884908
17757. with	all his musical activities did he have the time and inclination to	do anything else	1253.5747684095575
17758. he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection	to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals	3044.2314488907973
17759. he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain	but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able	to see in paris a year ago	3118.6819215836963
17760. and how did he feel about modern	art	251.4115818579309
17761. again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he	was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments	1870.7099832694523
17762. as my wife puts	it he said again with a twinkle in his eyes all you know is	your music	2819.1415840993186
17763. but after all you never learned anything else!	what did he do for relaxation	944.5493599545534
17764. like his late colleague mitropoulos	he reads mystery stories in particular sir arthur conan doyle	1644.3050963676258
17765. he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature	262.2778081214802
17766. but his prime interest apart from music he insisted seriously was	his family- his wife daughter and son	2355.975591793636
17767. at the moment he was excited	about his son's having received the prix de rome in archaeology	and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation	of an etruscan tomb	3549.9665136419453
17768. both children are musical and my wife is	a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment	1885.2459356505879
17769. is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of the	angry	young men' of england	1243.8338180578662
17770. was the topic for a round-table discussion	at the bayerische rundfunk in munich	1186.3871214483963
17771. i was chairman	the only not youthful participant	167.78704478194285
17772. since attack serves to stimulate	interest in broadcasts i added to my opening statement a sentence in	which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which	is a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classified as uninterested	and bored rather than angry	6999.674010876474
17773. i was far from convinced of the	truth of my statement but could not think of anything that might evoke	responses more quickly	2320.0320160584893
17774. it is easy for you to talk;	countered a twenty year old law student you travel around the world	2609.0139291034247
17775. we would like to do that too	93.7568210766146
17776. but you want a job guaranteed	when you return i continued my attack	1184.4036172559017
17777. you must have	some security said a young clerk	263.5329307307343
17778. when i mentioned that	for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return	fare but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount	the young people looked at me doubtingly	6184.677066534249
17779. one girl expressed what was	obviously in their minds	261.02389496012876
17780. would you advise us to act the	same way	391.01690008719527
17781. you might have failed	2.943322030719629
17782. i think it is rather foolhardy to	trust to luck	559.6667837373934
17783. others mentioned that i might have had to	ask	friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign	country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international	understanding	3546.303793083481
17784. the debate needed no additional controversy	and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life what	his hopes were and what his fears	4089.271299841564
17785. though the four boys and	two girls the youngest nineteen years of age the oldest twenty-four	came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal	interests there was surprising agreement among them	3570.005349943808
17786. what they	wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political	instability in their own country	2809.0217275791433
17787. the ideal home they	agreed would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to	five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and	two children	3453.6521315907485
17788. no one wanted a larger family or no children and none	hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would	be satisfactory	4103.684333420928
17789. all expressed interest in world affairs	but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest	1568.3701413276726
17790. once again as in the days of the founding fathers america	faces a stern test	1660.0221491558696
17791. that test as president kennedy forthrightly	depicted it in his state of the union message will determine whether	a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure	3003.7703269091007
17792. it is well then that in this hour both of national peril	and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who	made the nation	4281.86326447686
17793. incapable of self-delusion the founding fathers	found the crisis of their time to be equally grave and yet they had	confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free	peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty	4710.169929779609
17794. seven founders- george washington benjamin franklin	john adams thomas jefferson alexander hamilton james	madison and john jay- determined the destinies of the new nation	3721.735017189016
17795. in certain respects their task was incomparably greater than ours today	for there was nobody before them to show them the way	2177.6180341147938
17796. as madison	commented to jefferson in 1789 we are in a wilderness without	a single footstep to guide us	2590.065161218415
17797. our successors will have an easier task	94.37332540208747
17798. they thought of themselves to use jefferson's words	as the argonauts who had lived in the heroic age	2367.4777548095512
17799. accordingly	they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential	sources for posterity	936.3896201577325
17800. their writings assume more than dramatic or	patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in	which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but rather	as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen	that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved	7508.0095590269075
17801. strong men with strong opinions frank to the point	of being refreshingly indiscreet the founding seven were essentially	congenial minds and their agreements with each other were more consequential	than their differences	3448.849838921683
17802. even though in most cases the completion	of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off	enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing	a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual	feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation	7335.848050376517
17803. before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember	that their separate careers were extraordinary	1566.9107691683748
17804. certainly no other	seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in	so concentrated a span of years	2814.012979680598
17805. eldest of the seven benjamin	franklin a new englander transplanted to philadelphia wrote the	most dazzling success story in our history	2030.53947046056
17806. the young printer's apprentice	achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields as editor	and publisher scientist inventor philanthropist and statesman	2836.553185454576
17807. author of the albany plan of union which had it been adopted might	have avoided the revolution he fought the colonists' front-line	battles in london negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and	the peace that ended the war headed the state government of pennsylvania	and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal	convention	5262.144220606488
17808. on a military mission for his native virginia	the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian	war then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia	4662.362816714458
17809. commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution	he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory	1883.5639326441847
17810. retiring	to his beloved mount vernon he returned to preside over the federal	convention and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected	president	4080.6687118623217
17811. during his two terms the constitution was tested and	found workable strong national policies were inaugurated and the	traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed	2866.44214948898
17812. john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology wrote	the constitution of his home state of massachusetts negotiated	with franklin and jay the peace with britain and served as our first	vice president and our second president	5935.169833612757
17813. his political	opponent and lifetime friend thomas jefferson achieved immortality	through his authorship of the declaration of independence but	equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted	in his native virginia his role as father of our territorial system	and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first	term as president	5187.373044269347
17814. during the greater part of jefferson's	career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian james	madison eight years his junior	3280.9650579657487
17815. the active sponsor of jefferson's	measure for religious liberty in virginia madison played the most	influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in	securing its ratification in virginia founded the first political	party in american history and as jefferson's secretary of state	and his successor in the presidency guided the nation through the	troubled years of our second war with britain	5706.003835101418
17816. if franklin was	an authentic genius then alexander hamilton with his exceptional	precocity consuming energy and high ambition was a political prodigy	3273.584038465539
17817. his revolutionary pamphlets published when he was only 19 quickly	brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders	1727.4887370985648
17818. principal author	of the federalist he swung new york over from opposition	to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly	2599.7098204009117
17819. his	collaboration with washington begun when he was the general's aide	during the revolution was resumed when he entered the first cabinet	as secretary of the treasury	2860.0109147964044
17820. his bold fiscal program and his broad	interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions	1658.2204128121425
17821. less dazzling than hamilton less eloquent than jefferson	john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers	1739.0155644679066
17822. he served as president of the continental congress	250.5802010388689
17823. he played	the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that	ended the revolution and directed america's foreign affairs throughout	the confederation period	2608.312361329653
17824. as first chief justice his strong	nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall	750.7166316123989
17825. he ended his public	career as a two-term governor of new york	648.2024480870263
17826. these seven founders	constituted an intellectual and social elite the most respectable	and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed	2588.859352374313
17827. their	social status was achieved in some cases by birth as with washington	jefferson and jay; in others by business and professional acumen	as with franklin and adams or in hamilton's case by an influential	marriage	3869.595111933523
17828. unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals	in underdeveloped nations of our own day they commanded both prestige	and influence before the revolution started	3706.258345382671
17829. as different	physically as the tall angular jefferson was from the chubby rotund	adams the seven were striking individualists	1733.3825365217374
17830. ardent opinionated	even obstinate they were amazingly articulate wrote their own copy	and were masters of phrasemaking	2118.3452797348627
17831. capable of enduring friendships	they were also stout controversialists who could write with	a drop of vitriol on their pens	1869.5334011894327
17832. john adams dismissed john dickinson	who voted against the declaration of independence as a certain	great fortune and piddling genius	2833.4126600794925
17833. washington castigated his	critic general conway as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue	to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity	2329.8274385476566
17834. and	hamilton who felt it a religious duty to oppose aaron burr's	political ambitions would have been a better actuarial risk had	he shown more literary restraint	4294.550004715425
17835. the seven founders were	completely dedicated to the public service	376.5229164250826
17836. madison once remarked:	my life has been so much a public one a comment which fits the	careers of the other six	3286.0590647335885
17837. franklin retired from editing and publishing	at the age of 42 and for the next forty-two years devoted himself	to public scientific and philanthropic interests	2609.619435251201
17838. washington never	had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved	best plantation management	2602.762056446434
17839. he served as commander in chief during	the revolution without compensation	500.92705644823764
17840. john adams took	to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor jeremiah gridley	to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it	4453.571686171997
17841. in	taking account of seventeen years of law practice adams concluded	that no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did	and for so little profit	3098.5389137861575
17842. when the revolution broke out he along	with jefferson and jay abandoned his career at the bar with considerable	financial sacrifice	3054.7776809342986
17843. hamilton poorest of the seven	gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington's cabinet	1098.1899735707307
17844. while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of	the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends	3062.160936301687
17845. if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars he wrote	one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury	2173.558817717203
17846. to	support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell	of public service	2123.7993070190673
17847. talleyrand passed his new york law office one	night on the way to a party	1104.0444926771474
17848. hamilton was bent over his desk drafting	a legal paper by the light of a candle	1894.4390808140747
17849. i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune	of his country but now is working all night in order to support his	family he reflected	3224.230071379252
17850. all seven combined ardent devotion	to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality	1878.6498931821757
17851. john	adams asserted in the continental congress' declaration of	rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their	charters the british constitution and the common law and jefferson	appealed in the declaration of independence to the tribunal of	the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of	nature and of nature's god	5410.323704549837
17852. they fought hard but they were	forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures	from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of	1783	4272.809666813303
17853. this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified	in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee	peter van schaack	2466.830954837666
17854. jay had participated in the decision that exiled	his old friend van schaack	1177.2736151785268
17855. yet when at war's end the ex-tory	made the first move to resume correspondence jay wrote him from	paris where he was negotiating the peace settlement:	as	an independent american i considered all who were not for us and you	amongst the rest as against us yet be assured that john jay never	ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack	5614.652921396939
17856. the latter	in turn assured him that were i arraigned at the bar and you my	judge i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause	4999.957654943635
17857. all seven recognized that independence was but the first	step toward building a nation	948.1601218929336
17858. we have now a national character	to establish washington wrote in 1783	961.1608019868172
17859. think continentally	hamilton counseled the young nation	95.20755832460858
17860. this new force love of country	super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's	own state was epitomized by washington	3047.998436585309
17861. his first inaugural	address speaks of my country whose voice i can never hear but with	veneration and love	1727.96844327847
17862. all sought the fruition of that nationalism	in a federal government with substantial powers	1410.798963843457
17863. save jefferson	all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal	constitution	795.6709306624466
17864. they supported it not as a perfect instrument but as	the best obtainable	1190.1777423471262
17865. historians have traditionally regarded the great	debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized	vs limited government with hamilton and the nationalists	supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter	position	3877.8377737879664
17866. the state's rights position was formulated by	jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves but	in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better	hamiltonians than jeffersonians	5311.393698171361
17867. in purchasing louisiana jefferson	had to adopt hamilton's broad construction of the constitution	and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton's	bank which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception and in	adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff	4223.670041764098
17868. indeed the old jeffersonians	were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they	were to the jacksonian democrats	2577.605687971829
17869. when in 1832 the south	carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition	which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve they elicited	no encouragement from that senior statesman	3219.2122268640096
17870. in his political testament	advice to my country penned just before his death madison	expressed the wish that the union of the states be cherished	and perpetuated	4284.382893900705
17871. let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora	with her box opened; and the disguised one as the serpent creeping	with his deadly wiles into paradise	3123.0441408610027
17872. nostalgic yankee	readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians	that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway over	which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the	dow-jones average than with the cotton crop	6341.6798460377595
17873. thus we are compelled	to face the urbanization of the south- an urbanization which despite	its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture	has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers	3664.4452475063454
17874. indeed it	seems that only in today's southern fiction does tobacco road	with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint	juleps continue to live- but only as a weary overexploited phantom	5505.637034182069
17875. those writers known collectively as the southern school	have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize;	according to many critics in fact the south has led the north	in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively	4320.490324452613
17876. such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren	have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum	renaissance	3676.365387489771
17877. this is not to say that the south is no longer	agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification	3270.38704720555
17878. but the south is and has been for the past century engaged	in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough is not reflected	in its literature	2607.1818294918894
17879. in 1900 the south was only 15% urban;	in 1950 it had become 47	1413.5905198424848
17880. in a mere half-century the south	has more than tripled its urban status	794.5321706532187
17881. there is a new south emerging	a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with	the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades	4125.208318417618
17882. as	the new south snowballs toward further urbanization it becomes more	and more homogeneous with the north- a tendency which willard	thorp terms yankeefication as evidenced in such cities as charlotte	birmingham and houston	3672.309889542497
17883. it is said that even at the present	stage of southern urbanization such a city as atlanta is not distinctly	unlike columbus or trenton	3704.5220790074527
17884. undoubtedly even the old southern	stalwart richmond has felt the new wind: william styron mentions	in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder a civil	war general now renamed in typical california fashion buena	vista terrace	4066.58180453797
17885. the effects of television and other mass media	are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force	2356.350518443373
17886. as for progress the backward south can boast of baton rouge	which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred	and sixty-two percent to 126000 the second largest growth of the period	for all cities over 25000	4130.019120380321
17887. the field then is ripe for	new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century	phenomenon the southern yankeefication: the new urban economy	the city-dweller the pains of transition the labor problems; the	list is obviously endless	6340.650679843035
17888. but these sources have not been tapped	93.42941510230709
17889. truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism exaggerating	the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque but	as unreal as- or even more unreal than- yesterday	4492.0469171673885
17890. william	styron while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance	insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and	yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes	3572.45799631029
17891. even the great god faulkner the south's one probable contender	for literary immortality has little concerned himself with these matters;	such are simply not within his bounded province	4488.859899097917
17892. where	are the writers to treat these changes	167.59076610980406
17893. has the agrarian tradition	become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded	or unwanted	2368.9578754071763
17894. perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the	older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated	testings over the decades	2187.235917758181
17895. lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to	write of a new economy these writers seem to be contenting themselves	with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money	4851.794670491542
17896. an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region	may be seen in the southern negro's quest for a position in	the white-dominated society a problem that has been reflected in regional	fiction especially since 1865	4121.940953714873
17897. today the negro must discover his	role in an industrialized south which indicates that the racial	aspect of the southern dilemma hasn't changed radically but rather	has gradually come to be reflected in this new context this new coat	of paint	6420.127553828314
17898. the negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting	himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one	2327.8889892029283
17899. this	represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem	561.7606528625927
17900. but there	have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins the picket lines	the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago	2607.4849177777623
17901. today's evidence such as the fact that only three southern states	still openly defy integration	would have astounded many of yesterday's southerners into speechlessness	3685.908219578694
17902. other examples of gradual changes that have	affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the busses;	his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions	better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before	the supreme court decision of 1954	4673.158660473178
17903. then came this decision which	sped the process of gaining equality	: an abrupt change	798.4380738263296
17904. since 1954 the negro's desire for social justice has led	to an ironically anarchical rebellion	1094.3472340920534
17905. he has frequently refused to move	from white lunch counters refused to obey local laws which he	considers unjust while in other cases he has appealed to federal	laws	4642.4664436286275
17906. this bold self-assertion after decades of humble subservience	is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern	way of existence	2180.19739143853
17907. a new order is thrusting itself into being	252.17212844012596
17908. a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation	uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role	in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white	man	3664.6284825178204
17909. the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern	fiction	962.5706077285435
17910. it is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing	the negro as a woolly-headed humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs	and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer	this stereotype is doomed	to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell's lester	4455.965507066295
17911. while	there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through	the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed	3261.4438939880624
17912. writers	openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man;	but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro	type	2984.741357282769
17913. presenting an individualized negro character it would	seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could	tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above	glaringly rare	5345.8655865985
17914. just as the negro situation points up the	gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life it also points up	the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature	2726.8734358314055
17915. the book	concerned with the negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed;	recently only keith wheeler's novel peaceable lane has	openly faced the problem	4119.732239819574
17916. all but the most rabid of confederate	flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in	actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance	of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid	ante-bellum way of life	4441.26917094157
17917. many earlier writers mourning the demise	of the old order tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious	old south imagery creating such lasting impressions as margaret	mitchell's	tara plantation	4647.924221722879
17918. modern writers who are supposed	to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects insist	upon drawing out this legend prolonging its burial when it well deserves	a rest after the overexploitation of the past century	4032.5468961105676
17919. perhaps	these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but	they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old panorama is dead	3888.84971366831
17920. as john t westbrook says in his article twilight of southern	regionalism: h	the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely	autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever	dead and forever done with	4299.350009020685
17921. westbrook	further bemoans the southern writers' creation of an unreal image	of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign	readers and visiting yankees: our northerner is suspicious of	all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses	6418.830483330959
17922. it bewilders and befuddles him	14.877122239090326
17923. he is too deeply steeped in william	faulkner and robert penn warren	962.9042066894324
17924. the fumes of progress are in his	nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes but his	heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night	riders	3448.638749209441
17925. on this trip to the south he wants above all else to sniff	the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at	least one barn burn at midnight	4466.090089717327
17926. obviously such a northern tourist's	purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with disneyland:	he wants to see a world of make-believe	2317.8744787996366
17927. in the	meantime while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization	that is so disappointing to the curious yankee southern writers	have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's	progress	5323.266706566999
17928. willard thorp in his new book american writing in	the twentieth century observes quite validly it seems: h	certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched	3107.3625938136033
17929. no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what	herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did	for new york h there are almost no fictional treatments of the	industrialized south	5630.647053976165
17930. not a single southern author major or minor	has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material	2042.0504774951398
17931. faulkner for one appears to be safe from the accusing	fingers of all assailants in this regard	2112.4386971068443
17932. faulkner culminates the	southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been or could	ever be done	1570.125391340625
17933. he has made it his and his it remains irrevocably	558.3903090166529
17934. he treats it with a mythological universal application	167.01337268375968
17935. as	his disciples boast even though his emphasis is elsewhere faulkner	does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly	as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes	families	6087.607643376229
17936. even two decades ago in go down moses faulkner	was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through	its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the	curse of slavery erased from its soil	4609.175470700977
17937. yet his concern even here is	with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general and he never	deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial	impact	5012.993101317348
17938. faulkner traces in his vast and overpowering saga	of yoknapatawpha county the gradual changes which seep into the	south building layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually	tend largely to hide the old way	3852.7461992610297
17939. thus faulkner reminds	us and wisely that the new south has gradually evolved out of	the old south and consequently its agrarian roots persist	3691.0574995844545
17940. yet he	presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers	if not himself: the problems with which a new south must grapple	in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization	3949.828724768183
17941. with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of	six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil	3272.2686201256033
17942. the	thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with	even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually	surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas	3458.7630479001064
17943. another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual	devices of the theatre	1647.6536517674845
17944. most avant-garde creators true to their	interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement have tended to dress	their dancers in simple lines and solid colors and to	give them a bare cyclorama for a setting	3756.108633180266
17945. but robert rauschenberg	the neo-dadaist artist has collaborated with several of them	963.1715466294254
17946. he has	designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white	for mr cunningham's summerspace so that dancers and background	merge into a shimmering unity	2988.126757965806
17947. for mr taylor's images	and reflections he made some diaphanous tents that alternately	hide and reveal the performer and a girl's cape lined with grass	3902.969466488748
17948. mr	nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume	and decor	942.5804872105355
17949. in fact he calls his productions dance-theatre works	of motion shape light and sound	1417.3649050375327
17950. to raise the dancer out of his personal	pedestrian self mr nikolais has experimented with relating	him to a larger environmental orbit	2179.827722400515
17951. he began with masks to make	the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be	2111.0607561024117
17952. he	went on to use objects- hoops poles capes- which he employed as	extensions of the body of the dancer who moved with them	2439.9349384202246
17953. the depersonalization	continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play	of lights upon his figure	2121.637554404656
17954. in each case the object the color even	the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become	part of the theatrical being of the performer	2864.0122012009106
17955. the dancer who never	loosens her hold on a parasol begins to feel that it is part of herself	2585.8336837990837
17956. or clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of	hoops the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial	2867.486609043617
17957. as the dancer is depersonalized his accouterments are animized	and the combined elements give birth to a new being	2597.6279229743054
17958. from this being	come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single	unit	1261.6392265064978
17959. thus the avant-garde choreographers have extended the	scope of materials available for dance composition	1408.7311448385358
17960. but since they	have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity how are they	to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal	2324.2668420605505
17961. some	look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply	corresponding methods to their own work	2819.2227405843832
17962. others less consciously	but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment	with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter	and musician	2726.5254787870736
17963. an approach that has appealed to some choreographers	is reminiscent of charles olson's statement of the process	of projective verse: one perception must immediately and directly	lead to a further perception	5001.211742177299
17964. the creator trusts his intuition to	lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors	the reality of his experience	2317.7365384604554
17965. he disdains external restrictions- conventional	syntax traditional metre	251.42374472912144
17966. the unit of form is determined	subjectively: the heart by the way of the breath to the line	1574.9783732336998
17967. the test of form is fidelity to the experience a gauge also accepted	by the abstract expressionist painters	2381.8434651829257
17968. an earlier but	still influential school of painting surrealism had suggested the way	of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly	incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations	of the subconscious	3849.0801076268203
17969. the resulting picture might appear a maze of	restless confusions and contradictions but it is more true to life than	a portrait of an artificially contrived order	4294.110041086829
17970. the contemporary painter	tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but	their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines colors masses	and energies	2853.4903301662443
17971. he is still concerned however with a personal event	393.54626574052406
17972. he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence	of the vitality of the experience of creation	1711.3961627416297
17973. the work must	be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience	1896.2764456175119
17974. some painters have less interest in the experience of the	moment with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities than in looking	beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more serene level	of truth	3650.7669166788864
17975. rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations	they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which symbolize	an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world	5009.133083124273
17976. but in this approach it is the artist's	ultimate insight rather than his immediate impressions that gives	form to the work	2036.4131930310516
17977. others look to more objective devices of	order	251.36443055420932
17978. the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes	a mathematical system of rotations that once set in motion	determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities	3223.8781028272706
17979. the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of	intervals	1407.9647510036598
17980. he may even alter the pattern	by applying a scheme of random numbers	788.7873369547087
17981. but he cannot order his	elements by will either rational or inspired	962.745397436632
17982. the system works as an	impersonal mechanism	94.11090460151091
17983. musicians who use the chance method also exclude	subjective control of formal development	1178.65397265112
17984. again the composer must	select his own materials	168.2716434828068
17985. but a tossing of coins with perhaps the added	safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching the chinese	book of changes dictates the handling of the chosen materials	5002.93635744135
17986. avant-garde choreographers seeking new forms of continuity	for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches	1564.7057611217097
17987. some let dances take their form from the experience of creation	753.5230147527283
17988. according to katherine litz the becoming the process of realization	is the dance	795.7241319848983
17989. the process stipulates that the choreographer	sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that	he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it	4807.78308648979
17990. the sequence	may involve a sharp contrast: for example a quiet meditative sway	of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle	distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged	its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred	to become a movement of only the arms or the head	5469.319582679507
17991. even the least	alteration will change the quality	250.21588700710527
17992. an exploration of these possible	relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form	to the dance	1578.8252674709604
17993. the approach to the depiction of the experience	of creation may be analytic as it is for miss litz or spontaneous	as it is for merle marsicano	4280.791749496651
17994. she too is concerned with the	becoming the process of realization but she does not think in	terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns	2715.997650101423
17995. the design	is determined emotionally: i must reach into myself for the spring	that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event	with which the dance confronts me	4825.981809258977
17996. looking back miss marsicano	feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock	1402.8967776708328
17997. at one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all	over the stage much as pollock's paintings move violently over	the full extent of the canvas	4467.389628896685
17998. but her conscious need was to break away	from constricting patterns of form a need to let the experience shape	itself	2027.1324509071505
17999. midi garth also believes in subjective continuity	that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement	2125.850934411815
18000. it	may be a free front-back swing of the leg leading to a sideways swing	of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off	from the ground	3473.641754139888
18001. this became a dance called prelude to flight	248.66329662890553
18002. a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close	to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus	2750.7860525903734
18003. alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal	emotion	751.1865111037389
18004. he seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating	them to the impersonal elements of shape light color and sound	2029.2756299275297
18005. if	his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures	from mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in	the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their	pedestrian identities	6581.336582361177
18006. it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the	germ of form is discovered	792.1026661271155
18007. in his recognition of his impersonal self	the dancer moves and this self in the first revealed stroke of	its existence states the theme from which all else must follow	4820.481790802859
18008. the	theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve	942.2083003802891
18009. it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the following movements	constituting further reactions	1667.1879156756204
18010. it may establish the relation of the	figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the	light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs	3447.6172454018224
18011. unconcerned	with the practical function of his actions the dancer is engrossed	exclusively in their motional content	2117.6047252831386
18012. movements unfold freely	because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive	792.0908724912807
18013. but the metamorphosis must come first	65.1694787882827
18014. though he is also concerned	with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity merce	cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim	2606.646627736488
18015. he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity any line of action	related to the concept of cause and effect	2346.144334165365
18016. he bases his approach	on the belief that anything can follow anything	640.5552687830597
18017. an order can be chanced	rather than chosen and this approach produces an experience that	is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered	3683.1812330187195
18018. thus	there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance	but in the shape of their continuity as well	2183.1300797810695
18019. chance he finds enables	him to create a world beyond imagination	755.6407007054029
18020. he cites with pleasure	the comment of a lady who exclaimed after a concert: why	it's extremely interesting	1580.4071932871852
18021. but i would never have thought of it myself	389.8831792853015
18022. the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is	unlike any sequence to be seen in life	1414.8997753592155
18023. at one side of the stage a dancer	jumps excitedly; nearby another sits motionless while still another	is twirling an umbrella	3034.8605212162283
18024. a man and a girl happen to meet; they	look straight at the audience not at each other	1580.5695252125565
18025. he lifts her puts	her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing	had happened	2363.1432100490374
18026. if one dancer slaps another the victim may do a pirouette	sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon	2053.3128678853213
18027. events occur	without apparent reason	22.024630256061176
18028. their consequences are irrelevant- or there	are no consequences at all	502.4714419850701
18029. the sequence is determined by	chance and mr cunningham makes use of any one of several chance	devices	2345.7860752920596
18030. he may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab	bag	945.5591075850995
18031. the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal	organization of the dance but also its spatial design special	slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be	performed	5788.221128751397
18032. the other variables include the dancer who is to perform	the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance	2452.247119010406
18033. the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the	movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate	total duration of the dance	4287.937894982357
18034. the approximate is important because	even after the order of the work has been established by the chance	method the result is not inviolable	2474.804513630509
18035. each performance may be different	22.11418985509143
18036. if a work is divided into several large segments a last-minute	drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for	any particular performance	2729.5217313912567
18037. and any sequence can not only change its	positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether	2822.7746603044643
18038. mr cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he	adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can	1729.1550412563633
18039. however there is always	the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible	to execute	2106.9464734364656
18040. then the choreographer must arbitrate	14.759289828250342
18041. he must	rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other	1413.038615344981
18042. he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone	one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation	for the leap	3228.3766617429337
18043. the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty	through all their dispute about it than were the founding fathers	3262.9481432272273
18044. the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen	of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defended in the end	by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee	3332.962873020331
18045. the people everywhere	had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in	understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their	union	4279.68313558834
18046. repeated efforts- beginning with the missouri compromise	of 1821- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas	to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear	thought and timely action	3548.554796078238
18047. even so confusion in this period gained	such strength that it led to the	bloodiest war of the nineteenth century	2805.616811181021
18048. nothing can show more than	this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in	even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty	2858.2167802773383
18049. the present issue in atlantica- whether to transform an	alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens-	resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that	was resolved by civil war	5782.700948499119
18050. and so i would only touch upon it now		128.1042216462419
18051. i think it is	essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts	of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better	how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse	confusion on this subject	6790.145737708985
18052. the difference came down to this:	the southern states insisted that the united states was in last	analysis what its name implied- a union of states	2719.022572227786
18053. to their leaders	the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign	states who therefore retained the right to secede from it	3695.00517863176
18054. this right	of the state its upholders contended was essential to maintain	the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger	of centralizing power in the union government	3465.8518163907647
18055. the champions of	the union maintained that the constitution had formed fundamentally	the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign	citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right	to secede though the citizens could	6588.254787187038
18056. writing to speed on august	24 1855 lincoln made the latter point clear	792.1888501675581
18057. in homely terms whose	timeliness is startling today he thus declared his own right to secede	1895.8512651055105
18058. we began by declaring that all men are created equal	373.4562279525238
18059. we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes	958.4040144269532
18060. when the know-nothings get control it will read all	men	are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics	1723.532123646442
18061. when	it comes to this i shall prefer emigrating to some country where	they make no pretence of loving liberty- to russia for instance where	despotism can be taken pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy	5766.764009499874
18062. his emphasis   when the southern states exercised	their right to secede they formed what they officially styled the	confederate states of america	2160.9379293203265
18063. dictionaries as we have	seen still cite this government along with the articles of confederation	of 1781 as an example of a confederacy	3481.2645708976206
18064. the fact is that the	southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as	the federal constitution did	1888.362771612484
18065. the confederate constitution copied	much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in	substance	2119.3647992947035
18066. it operated on by and for the people individually just as	did the federal constitution	1107.9252400390762
18067. it made substantially the same division	of power between the central and state governments and among the	executive legislative and judicial branches	3282.1806319904426
18068. confederacy and federal union in 1861	many believe- and understandably-	that the great difference between the constitution of	the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the	former recognized the right of each state to secede	3950.2943670690374
18069. but though each	of its members had asserted this right against the union the final	constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11- nearly a month	before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing	a state to secede	6078.177722773331
18070. its drafters discussed this vital point but	left it out of their constitution	779.6242184268414
18071. their president jefferson davis	interpreted their constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced	association but this reremained so doubtful that there were	frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution	5756.722549979548
18072. the constitution of the southern confederation	differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects:	it openly defiantly recognized slavery- an institution	which the southerners of 1787 even though they continued it found so	impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning	the word in the federal constitution	5154.067944921343
18073. the	other important difference between the two constitutions was that the	president of the confederacy held office for six	years and was limited to one term	2734.3985589142276
18074. these are not however differences	in federal structure	249.52383532964967
18075. the only important differences from that	standpoint between the two constitutions lies in their preambles	1094.4935798770587
18076. we	the people of the confederate states each state acting in its	sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal	government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure	the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking	the favor and the guidance of almighty god- do ordain and establish	this constitution for the confederate states of america	5578.003595025905
18077. one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts	of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth	century was fought	4277.384358270583
18078. but though the southern states when drafting	a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this	fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede the fact remained	that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept	that it was composed primarily of sovereign states	4985.146349699167
18079. if the union	conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining	state whenever it saw fit to secede: this would destroy the federal	balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to	the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained	by their union	7883.231827546575
18080. lincoln saw that the act of secession made the	issue for the union a vital one: whether it was a union of sovereign	citizens that should continue to live or an association of sovereign	states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism	4552.2240237602
18081. much as he abhorred slavery lincoln was always willing to	concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether	to continue or end it	4097.402258345882
18082. though his election was interpreted by	many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal	balance in favor of the union lincoln himself proposed no such change	in the rights the constitution gave the states	4050.7087309710623
18083. after the war began	he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action	even in the border states that stayed with the union	4102.852597649928
18084. he issued	his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left	him no other way to save the union	1880.2432495552475
18085. in his message of december	2 1862 he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which i	would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union: in giving	freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free	6071.041991966535
18086. what	lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people	were sovereign in the union	1563.4090501972123
18087. he fought to the end to preserve it	as a government of the people by the people for the people	2823.7718012791097
18088. truth on each side won in the civil war	the fact that the americans	who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to	keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis	of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer and the greater	4740.478527013113
18089. out of this ordeal the citizen emerged in the south as in the north	as america's true sovereign in a new birth of freedom as	lincoln promised	4299.087388420161
18090. but before this came about 214938 americans had	given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights	of men and of states	2738.5917031225727
18091. on their decisive battlefield lincoln	did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave	men living and dead who fought here	3686.0443140637462
18092. he understood that both	sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so explicitly	in his second inaugural	2019.5156000980558
18093. to my knowledge lincoln remains	the only head of state and commander-in-chief who while fighting	a fearful war whose issue was in doubt proved man enough to say this	publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human	truth there is some error and in all our error some truth	7866.728728419957
18094. so great	a man could not but understand too that the thing that moves men to	sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought which their	opponents see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see-	any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves	defend	5266.629262646093
18095. it is much less difficult now than in lincoln's day	to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives	in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had	delegated to the states and to their union	6688.548956999238
18096. they differed in the	balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen-	but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental	truth: that individual life liberty and happiness depend	on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty	in all its aspects which this involves	5251.916527154395
18097. the 140414 americans	who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion	preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers	of anarchy inherent in confederations which throughout history have	proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign	states and to the liberties of their people	7657.229929367412
18098. but the fact that	70524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing	concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways	2319.2592862057563
18099. its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing	the southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even	less compatible with the sovereignty of man	4978.570590625838
18100. the very fact that they	came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their	losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced	lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure	4393.798401802021
18101. there was	a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another	754.8760774379945
18102. there was also a	lesson one that has served ever since to keep americans in their conflicts	with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet	2992.5046643174496
18103. yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case	they did not lose the truth they fought for	3016.797300365529
18104. the lives so many of them	gave to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment	by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued	ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom's other foe	4116.994221071929
18105. as cells coalesced into organisms they built new unnatural and	internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with	the entropy-increasing properties of the external world	4100.537775105685
18106. the useful	suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a	third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with	our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique	for building protective artificial environments	4127.203074619104
18107. one wonders	about its applicability to people	140.1189211367229
18108. will advances in human sciences help	us build social structures and governments which will enable us to	cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein	and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to	adapt to a sea of molecular interaction	4728.548744417721
18109. the answer is of course yes	65.39878652984011
18110. for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit composed	of people which gives us both some immunity from and a way of dealing	with other people	3229.9406471863554
18111. social invention did not have to await social	theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier	or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes	5492.800237351699
18112. but it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific	revolution that our independence from the physical environment has	made the most rapid strides	2744.9747248238773
18113. we have ample light when the sun sets;	the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly	through the air although gravity pulls us down; the range of our	voice ignores distance	5630.265297482226
18114. at what stage are social sciences then	93.35585209913167
18115. is	the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time	of newton	2111.325845006657
18116. there is a haunting resemblance between the notion	of cause in copernicus and in freud	1094.4472137249186
18117. and it is certainly no slight	to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact	2354.4757617362347
18118. political theoretical understanding although almost at a standstill	during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth	centuries and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased	the possibility for man to coexist with man	3845.924534448248
18119. consitutional government	popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions cooperatives	communes socialized ownership world courts and the veto	power in world councils are but a few examples	4647.733000947258
18120. most of these with	horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to	quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to	survive and enjoy it	3851.6604188136225
18121. the most effective political inventions seem to	make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters	can play only a minor part in the whole scheme	4642.0264554808255
18122. just as present	technology had to await the explanations of physics so one might	expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding	2319.650246941692
18123. we are desperately in the need of such invention for man is	still very much at the mercy of man	2793.6547933443917
18124. in fact the accumulation of the	hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other	1725.5317669015706
18125. i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different	fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding	and fear	2819.896261424288
18126. there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human	sciences which in themselves and even without political invention	can help to dispel our present fears	2715.219273270869
18127. lucretius has remarked: the	reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all	sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause	and these they attribute to the will of god	6315.394859584861
18128. perhaps things	were even worse then	43.79917652026093
18129. it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears	of man	556.5519923998617
18130. we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and	from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people	now than man ever was	3101.3904558000418
18131. we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in	the same way that people once feared comets	2120.951190979844
18132. the bombs are as harmless	as an automobile in a garage	506.52392203266
18133. we are worried about what people may	do with them- that some crazy fool may push the button	2357.3119839422006
18134. i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human	fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific	explanations that stand out quite clearly	3223.5416524159973
18135. they are in general	those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual	2128.158460907958
18136. they include both individual fears and collective ones	167.67337825880514
18137. they arise	in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not	only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior	of the individual or group	5012.491758582741
18138. often it is recognized that all the details	of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because	the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical	understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements	are effective and the whole pattern becomes ritualized	4756.152626998114
18139. yet often	fear persists because even with the most rigid ritual one is never	quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or	that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive	act	6478.296589965969
18140. to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates	the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much	of magic and superstition	2458.3354007568632
18141. but a somewhat more detailed analysis	of this process may be illuminating	951.7916634941757
18142. the frequently postulated	antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness	apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize	2728.6074134637993
18143. it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly	cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people	to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice	4975.843830814981
18144. this and other	fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the	ptolemaic	system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then more	firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could	account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions	4533.336843548224
18145. this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one	can eliminate fear without instituting any controls	2584.757662876647
18146. in fact although	we have dispelled the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves	that there are no dangers	1719.8420970806808
18147. there is still the remote possibility	of planetoid collision	390.87262839190737
18148. a meteor could fall on san francisco	93.06962469386124
18149. solar	activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought	749.4791231292655
18150. our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our	former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which in this case	amounts to doing nothing	2841.233516714932
18151. yet we no longer feel uneasy	65.6015794923169
18152. this almost	trivial example is nevertheless suggestive for there are some elements	in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter	and shorter and our present fear of war	3438.55834216474
18153. we in our country think	of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily	of our own doing	3480.9050105384313
18154. and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance	of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way	on the details of how we behave	2986.3327245710016
18155. what elements of our behavior are decisive	140.38096294394626
18156. our weapons production our world prestige our ideas of democracy	our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage	1889.4114554347998
18157. we have staved off a war and since our behavior has involved all	these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring	to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which	parts are effective	6563.377075960181
18158. i think that we are here also talking of	the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching	at night along the streets of a large city	3756.8075347917174
18159. if an automobile	were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though	he might not be able to act quickly enough	3880.717908667102
18160. with the group of boys	it is different	166.5519423143051
18161. he does not know whether to look up or look aside	to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side to cross	the street or to continue on the same side	5792.054837596148
18162. when confronted with	a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them	might do to me or to himself or to others	3102.2279771724147
18163. i believe that what i do	has some effect on his actions and i have learned in a way to commune	with drunks but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly	the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment	in physics	7135.462091923675
18164. i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some	unwitting slip all hell may break loose	1409.0934277232232
18165. our inability to explain	why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of	ritual and malaise	2813.0439905277713
18166. we are forced in our behavior towards others to	adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a	minimal understanding of their essential elements	2723.5442023259156
18167. our collective	policies group and national are similarly based on voodoo but	here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still	engaged in determing them	4469.155813059251
18168. we use terms from our personal experience	with individuals such as trust cheat and get tough	1261.466835340968
18169. we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus	talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles	3251.7252533260844
18170. we	perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually	no understanding of social cause and effect	1252.9881267641326
18171. small wonder then	that we fear	65.09280261578661
18172. the achievements which dispelled our fears of	the cosmos took place three centuries ago	938.6128468610939
18173. what additional roles has	the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played	1413.1276598211975
18174. in the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry	and atomic physics	646.7791077633365
18175. in the life sciences there has been an	enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of	heredity and in bio- and physiological chemistry	4103.269008192923
18176. the major effect	of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the	industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding	has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment	3955.011739394476
18177. in	addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also	changed	1185.768530985454
18178. even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding	is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with	lightning and weather and earthquakes the appropriate kind of human action	has been more adequately indicated	3771.2871220565444
18179. apparently the population	as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations	of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears	3492.6928613929426
18180. how and	why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject	for study	949.9787403673357
18181. in some areas the progress is slower than in others	564.634046541266
18182. in	agriculture for example despite the advances in biology elaborate	rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence	of some natural disaster	2733.518001648707
18183. in child care the opposite extreme prevails;	procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds	anything warranted by established psychological theory	3048.3240325797365
18184. there are	many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite	appropriate reduction in ritual and fear	1728.6532278963546
18185. much of the former extreme	uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death	has disappeared	1893.6513369969016
18186. the persistent horror of having a malformed child	has i believe been reduced not because we have gained any control	over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we	have so little control over it	3938.6348137261616
18187. in fact the recent warnings about the	use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which	now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance	science has momentarily aggravated our fears	5491.896655663309
18188. in fact insofar as	science generates any fear it stems not so much from scientific prowess	and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise	which until they are understood create uncertainty	3660.770744393496
18189. perhaps	the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding	is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease	3481.8857507512957
18190. the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease	contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect	to people	2176.7644745066436
18191. the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear	i have tried to describe	2114.8873708865844
18192. nothing like godot he arrived before the hour	167.85712886157427
18193. his letter had	suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i came into	the lobby as the clock struck twelve	3694.943110013359
18194. my wish	to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest	in his work	1419.68133931181
18195. american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays	nihilistic	393.2598471480337
18196. they find deep pessimism in them	43.15653417550039
18197. even so astute a commentator	as harold clurman of the nation has said that waiting	for godot is the concentrate h of the contemporary european	h mood of despair	4653.023142638438
18198. but to me beckett's writing had seemed	permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that	i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism	3110.724675926455
18199. could it	be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me	965.5265908867143
18200. is his a literature of	defeat irrelevant to the social crises we face	784.9532335081814
18201. or is it relevant	because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves	1404.5372416996784
18202. i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such	questions because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last	analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself	3968.105069488204
18203. my curiosity was sharpened a day or two	before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher	of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious	drama near paris	5371.806218459225
18204. when beckett's name came into the discussion	the priest	grew loud and told me that beckett hates life	1567.5464825017007
18205. that	i thought is at least one thing i can find out when we meet	1648.2496561256182
18206. beckett's appearance is rough-hewn irish	14.841542647130535
18207. the features of his face	are distinct but not fine	559.0380545663954
18208. they look as if they had been sculptured	with an unsharpened chisel	644.5069415116837
18209. unruly hair goes straight up from his	forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show	that it really is hair and not bristle	4664.929092288666
18210. one might say it combines	the man; own pride and humility	502.79166463253887
18211. for he has the pride that comes of	self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to	impose himself upon another	3466.6447446614607
18212. his light blue eyes set deep within the	face are actively and continually looking	949.3773317494239
18213. he seems by some unconscious	division of labor to have given them that one function and no	other leaving communication to the rest of the face	4099.690035858178
18214. the mouth frequently	breaks into a disarming smile	168.33451215259922
18215. the voice is light in timbre with	a rough edge that corresponds to his visage	1646.215652651427
18216. the irish accent is	as one would expect combined with slight inflections from the french	1117.0883401195329
18217. his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green	393.2925284414356
18218. he wore a brown knit	sports shirt with no tie	374.74154539666307
18219. we walked down the rue de l'arcade	thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe	opposite that church	3039.761998192588
18220. the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing	but it could hardly be called world-shattering	1089.8758552152499
18221. for one thing	the world that beckett sees is already shattered	751.6469980841997
18222. his talk turns to	what he calls the mess or sometimes this buzzing confusion	942.1956859587186
18223. i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our	conversation	759.9748273669063
18224. what appears here is shorter than what he actually said	but very close to his own words	1418.2204742111385
18225. the confusion is not my	invention	64.70725008376988
18226. we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without	being acutely aware of the confusion	1254.1958466105839
18227. it is all around us and our	only chance now is to let it in	1646.3732439482033
18228. the only chance of renovation is to	open our eyes and see the mess	947.6602276718752
18229. it is not a mess you can make sense of	566.192660558123
18230. i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth	but beckett did not take to the word truth	2171.5252547132586
18231. what is more	true than anything else	140.400394776788
18232. to swim is true and to sink is true	260.8666743275064
18233. one is not more true than the other	251.45208338077614
18234. one cannot speak anymore of being	one must speak only of the mess	792.033907132686
18235. when heidegger and sartre speak	of a contrast between being and existence they may be right i don't	know but their language is too philosophical for me	4259.723474180474
18236. i am not a	philosopher	15.0121035398375
18237. one can only speak of what is in front of him and that	now is simply the mess	2356.893132093455
18238. then he began to speak about the tension	in art between the mess and form	1100.7916258944176
18239. until recently art has withstood	the pressure of chaotic things	560.5741783222475
18240. it has held them at bay	43.39065058367705
18241. it realized	that to admit them was to jeopardize form	557.7959080817581
18242. how could the mess	be admitted because it appears to be the very opposite of form and	therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be	3102.957794271219
18243. but now we can keep it out no longer because we have come into a	time when it invades our experience at every moment	3670.9806650493906
18244. it is there	and it must be allowed in	260.2214617727386
18245. i granted this might be so but	found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously	3265.3073011941788
18246. and why not	0.20041515
18247. how i asked could chaos be admitted to	chaos	391.9831886403466
18248. would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art	785.6469309104859
18249. if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form	956.979452853902
18250. beckett's	own work is an example	43.75476623043273
18251. plays more highly formalized than waiting	for godot endgame and krapp's last tape would	be hard to find	2344.6763207639
18252. what i am saying does not mean that there	will henceforth be no form in art	1249.0051166991848
18253. it only means that there will	be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admits	the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something	else	5905.1549257850775
18254. the form and the chaos remain separate	94.27595278375418
18255. the latter is not reduced	to the former	250.29665461231966
18256. that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation	because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates	2054.0275060949116
18257. to find a form that accommodates the mess that is the task of	the artist now	1896.9545309811244
18258. yet i responded could not similar things	be said about the art of the past	1098.7741655880995
18259. is it not characteristic of the	greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify	demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable	way	4646.94505441732
18260. what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting	to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow	themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic	theory	4036.2036775388797
18261. isn't all art ambiguous	4.439538281062954
18262. not this he said	and gestured toward the madeleine	262.6268335128863
18263. the classical lines of the church	which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory dominated all	the scene where we sat	3264.5703093753555
18264. the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard	malesherbes and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery	bearing tidings of the age of reason	2603.9854312735
18265. this does not allow the mystery to invade us	389.90969476023656
18266. with classical art	all is settled	43.66128590917697
18267. but it is different at chartres	65.12020169083698
18268. there is the unexplainable	and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to	answer	1249.2189243803753
18269. i asked about the battle between life and death in	his plays	964.5372925046419
18270. didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide; hamm's	world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living	child outside	3093.347942569083
18271. is this life-death question a part of the chaos	391.62735721646425
18272. yes	0.20041515
18273. if life and death did not both present themselves to	us there would be no inscrutability	1876.6135571525501
18274. if there were only darkness all	would be clear	262.4718124810867
18275. it is because there is not only darkness but also	light that our situation becomes inexplicable	1878.7770032394942
18276. take augustine's doctrine	of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic	qualities in this theology	1579.8231222709057
18277. two thieves are crucified with christ	one saved and the other damned	966.5883728541597
18278. how can we make sense of this	division	166.16947451763636
18279. in classical drama such problems do not arise	249.75785365067264
18280. the destiny	of racine's phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed	into the dark	1267.3716799595
18281. as she goes she herself will be illuminated	249.67344057575943
18282. at	the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end	she has complete illumination but there has been no question but that	she moves toward the dark	3344.2626698112754
18283. within this notion clarity	is possible but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there	is not such clarity	2800.681767847831
18284. the question would also be removed if we believed	in the contrary- total salvation	941.6966734463143
18285. but where we have both dark	and light we have also the inexplicable	1189.247407354949
18286. the key word in my plays is	'perhaps'	166.79217050700325
18287. given a theological lead i asked what he	thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays	2583.2587915349045
18288. well really there is none at all	93.52718465259247
18289. i have no religious feeling	22.248552863989385
18290. once i had a religious emotion	43.69540846651
18291. it was at my first communion	65.27770809694303
18292. my mother was deeply religious	14.863684845893522
18293. he knelt	down at his bed as long as he could kneel	962.2482599778766
18294. the	family was protestant but for me it was only irksome and i let it	go	1256.9458878670227
18295. my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they	died	1189.251996925838
18296. at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school	tie	949.6435708547439
18297. irish catholicism is not attractive but it is deeper	391.7513906601262
18298. when	you pass a church on an irish bus all the hands flurry in the sign of	the cross	1733.5160007259353
18299. one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps	also the pigs	1653.971977060112
18300. but do the plays deal with the same facets	of experience religion must also deal with	1262.2955389212634
18301. yes for they	deal with distress	65.53839697079579
18302. some people object to this in my writing	165.63632997239012
18303. at a	party an english intellectual- so-called- asked me why i write	always about distress	1639.525711362705
18304. as if it were perverse to do so! he wanted	to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home	to give me an unhappy childhood	3459.551584209713
18305. i told him no that i had had a very	happy childhood	973.080482770339
18306. then he thought me more perverse than ever	166.16010842076628
18307. i left	the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi	1189.5309737113591
18308. on the glass partition	between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help	for the blind another help for orphans and the third for relief for	the war refugees	3444.118407392434
18309. one does not have to look for distress	250.43516394493176
18310. it is screaming	at you even in the taxis of london	503.5114544152425
18311. lunch was over	and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming	at us	2838.9202913796557
18312. the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar	to qualities i had found in the plays	1255.9654568927695
18313. he says nothing that compresses	experience within a closed pattern	564.0213765948151
18314. perhaps stands in	place of commitment	43.29918512070104
18315. at the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly	friendly	562.2721653372445
18316. if there were only the mess all would be clear; but	there is also compassion	1103.9200596083028
18317. as a christian i know i do not	stand where beckett stands but i do see much of what he sees	3043.720897915919
18318. as a	writer on the theater i have paid close attention to the plays	946.5805674173453
18319. harold	clurman is right to say that waiting for godot is a reflection	of the impasse and disarray	of europe's present politics ethic and common way of life	4443.179306378967
18320. yet it is not only europe the play refers to	374.1548109252185
18321. waiting for godot	sells even better in america than in france	752.3695302594084
18322. the consciousness	it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america but it	is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when	their successes in technological and economic systematization propel	them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture	4524.498300653857
18323. america is now joining europe in this mature phase of development	741.6591228544448
18324. whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens	as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going	on in the countries of asia and africa and also of course on how long	the cold war remains cold	4529.619295421135
18325. even hemingway for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality	in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never	maintained that sex was all	4293.44797292554
18326. hemingway's fiction is supported by a	moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at	a religious dimension	1878.7113637005355
18327. and d h lawrence in fantasia of the	unconscious protested vehemently against the overestimation of	the sexual motive	2358.9108227025
18328. though sex in some form or other enters into all human	activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect	of human nature it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of	sex	3837.6003469895268
18329. all is not sex declared lawrence	65.21570319951613
18330. man is not confined	to one outlet for his vital energy	502.97577780180256
18331. the creative urge for example	transcends the body and the self	759.2124883696983
18332. but for the beat generation	all is sex	167.67323092160842
18333. nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary	aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex	2810.634095738623
18334. for	the beatnik like the hipster is in opposition to a society that is based	on the repression of the sex instinct	2180.575991837116
18335. he has elevated sex- not	eros or libido but pure spontaneous uninhibited sex- to the rank	of the godhead; it is astarte ishtar venus yahwe dionysus	christ the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the	body of the universe	6371.612904930592
18336. jazz is sex marijuana is a stimulus to sex the	beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse	2182.2496282726524
18337. lawrence lipton in the holy barbarians stresses that for	the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a	mystique and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities	of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe	of discourse	7142.96079166789
18338. the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against	the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in	a public place	2320.292089173872
18339. the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression	of ungratified sexual desire	1419.2973034240297
18340. for this reason too their language	is more forthright and earthy	503.35516738526167
18341. the beatniks crave a sexual experience	in which their whole being participates	961.3859374056325
18342. it is therefore not	surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity	for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy	3109.4265647809816
18343. they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy	the precepts of legalized propriety	2115.2851347230617
18344. unlike the heroes and flappers	of the lost generation they disdain the art of necking and petting	1411.9867896600883
18345. that is reserved for the squares	65.51829196168414
18346. if they avoid the use	of the pungent outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo;	it is sacred	1881.7234215887104
18347. as lipton the prophet of the beat generation declares:	in the sexual act the beat are filled with mana the divine	power	3275.517014104202
18348. this is far from the vulgar leering sexuality of the middle-class	square in heat	947.2167135034994
18349. this is the holy grail these knights of	the orgasm pursue this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they	respond	3053.6576475626443
18350. if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out	of the egypt of sexual slavery dylan thomas is the poet who offers	them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence	in liquor marijuana sex and jazz	4124.727583461145
18351. in addition they have been converted	to zen buddhism with its glorification of all that is natural	and mysteriously alive the sense that everything in the world	is flowing	4659.055875830748
18352. thus paradoxically the beat writers resort to religious	metaphors: they are in search of mana the spiritual the numinous	but not anything connected with formal religion	2733.532294926569
18353. what they are	after is the beatific vision	253.1657153058477
18354. and zen buddhism though it is extremely	difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled	helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through	sexual release	2978.459291238164
18355. the style of life chosen by the beat generation	the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own	is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience	4851.053147046701
18356. jazz is	good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided	sexual effect	1252.9930120620957
18357. jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of	the orgasm; indeed it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz	by freeing the listener of his inhibitions can have therapeutic	value	5314.372676453022
18358. that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of	jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it	1730.4650445165057
18359. instead of giving themselves	spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they	undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes	for satisfaction	4297.214708131849
18360. thus jazz is transmuted into something holy the	sacred road to integration of being	943.7385860439178
18361. jazz like sex is a mystique	65.92749020661725
18362. it	is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative	impulse in unfettered man	1571.9712395942306
18363. the mystique of sex combined with	marijuana and jazz is intended to provide a design for living	2131.1023341627238
18364. those	who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free their	instincts put at the service of the imagination	1892.6931529510316
18365. righteous in their	denunciation of all that makes for death the beat prophets bid all	men become cool cats; let them learn to swing freely to let	go to become authentically themselves and then perhaps civilization	will be saved	6187.5864392131425
18366. the beatnik seceding from a society that is fatally	afflicted with a deathward drive is concerned with his personal salvation	in the living present	2478.124915149344
18367. if he is the child of nothingness if he	is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars then he will consult	only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil	5499.173930907865
18368. he will not	curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that	makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief	moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth	4054.723275663917
18369. that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the	title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines temples	museums and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the	life they believe in	6331.39060544146
18370. apart from the categorical imperative they derive	from the metaphysics of the orgasm the only affirmation they are	capable of making is that art is their only refuge	2995.571286456793
18371. their writing	born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality reflects	the extremity of their existential alienation	2355.6311414767447
18372. the mind has betrayed	them reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical	sensations the wisdom of the body the holy promptings of the unconscious	3112.910181309941
18373. with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate but their	faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz culminates	in the climax of the orgasm	4259.094151317137
18374. their work mirrors the mentality	of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible	504.291244823157
18375. their rebellion against	authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt	characteristic of the juvenile delinquent	2586.161993575216
18376. and the life they	lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive even though	they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit-	writing painting music	3101.142698098714
18377. they are non-conformists on principle	22.27805966489153
18378. when	they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth	the rage of repudiation the ecstasy of negation	1728.6220009912536
18379. it is sex that obsesses	them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed	1882.5038463883805
18380. what	they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can	inspire the muse	1262.2469372536575
18381. monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful	middle class continue to suffer whereas the beatnik has the courage	to break out of that prison of respectability	4449.368003182525
18382. one girl describes	her past her succession of broken marriages the abortions she has	had	and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she	must justify her passion	3442.579236781642
18383. if it is an honest feeling then why should	she not yield to it	1408.8263042433045
18384. most often she says it's the	monogamous relationship that is dishonest	499.73051692197123
18385. there is nothing	holy in wedlock	64.72242910524673
18386. this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist	who disapproves of her life	635.011270295824
18387. she finds married life stifling and every	prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous	967.1294898505785
18388. this confession	serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution:	the craving for sensation for its own sake the need for change	for new experiences	3091.241278770377
18389. in the realm of physical sensations	sex reigns supreme	393.93691736460835
18390. hence the beatniks sustain themselves on	marijuana jazz free swinging poetry exhausting themselves in orgies	of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and	lose contact with reality	3436.643025236072
18391. one beat poet composes a poem lines on	a tijuana john which contains a few happy hints for survival	2597.3238125610524
18392. the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must	move toward simplicity	1563.0415035153392
18393. the professed mission of this disaffiliated	generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry	and fiction but what they produce is unfortunately disordered nourished	solely on the hysteria of negation	5903.769119122362
18394. who are the creative	representatives of this movement	165.8708483364264
18395. nymphomaniacs junkies homosexuals	drug addicts lesbians alcoholics the weak the frustrated	the irresolute the despairing the derelicts and outcasts of society	3055.1271013774276
18396. they embrace independent poverty usually with a shack-up partner	who will help support them	936.20204574004
18397. they are full of contempt for the institution	of matrimony	556.8387761751071
18398. their previous legalized marriages do not count	for they hold the laws of the state null and void	1576.1184627899088
18399. they feel they	are leagued against a hostile persecutory world faced with the concerted	malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings the police	3497.729694643693
18400. this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending	their way of life their search for wholeness though their actual existence	fails to reach these religious heights	3098.979285626622
18401. one beatnik got	the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and	all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up	4286.802861967259
18402. what	obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk	639.3299858820403
18403. sex	as the creative principle of the universe the secret of primitive religion	the life of myth	2114.0632450197368
18404. everything in the final analysis reduced itself	to sexual symbolism	375.08788253588153
18405. in his chapter on the loveways of the	beat generation lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details	2598.0100618608985
18406. no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west	venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the	group	2743.894203874287
18407. the women who come to west venice having forsaken radicalism	are interested in living only for the moment in being constantly	on the move	3695.9812070869493
18408. others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat	generation are homosexuals heroin addicts and smalltime hoodlums	1565.9441904598393
18409. those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks	960.9705286648168
18410. since the homosexuals widely use marijuana they do not have to be	initiated	784.1830750039642
18411. part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana	750.8846950252282
18412. as lipton	puts it: the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana	with far greater force as a unifying principle in human relationships	than at any other time except perhaps in the mutual metaphysical	orgasms	3937.486701636263
18413. the magic circle is in fact a symbol of and preparation for	the metaphysical orgasm	1654.074950624116
18414. under the influence of marijuana the beatnik	comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense	of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being	3357.6342100133274
18415. carried high on this charge he composes magical poetry	that captures the organic rhythms of life in words	2358.012197604991
18416. if he thus achieves	a lyrical dreamlike drugged intensity he pays the price for his	indulgence by producing work- allen ginsberg's howl is	a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented dionysian	but without depth and without apollonian control	4228.349054197608
18417. for drugs are in	themselves no royal road to creativity	562.3502293302188
18418. how is the beat poet to achieve	unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic	derangement of senses	2453.417113301096
18419. if love reflects the nature of man as	ortega y gasset believes if the person in love betrays decisively what	he is by his behavior in love then the writers of the beat generation	are creating a new literary genre	6339.672034412497
18420. there were fences in the old days when we were children	500.08700816907947
18421. across	the front of a yard and down the side they were iron either spiked	along the top or arched in half circles	3472.7379798870898
18422. alley fences were made	of solid boards higher than one's head but not so high as the golden	glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them	3456.7699653217105
18423. side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front	fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle	3040.1751987421844
18424. square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of	cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail:	high-pitched roof pinnacle and narrow gable	2847.6398201569436
18425. on these posts	the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang	1897.9681337309034
18426. the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences	was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree	2323.5815993949136
18427. the primary	quality of that view seems now to have been its quietness but that	cannot at the time have impressed us	3239.0383638384706
18428. what one actually remembers	is its greenness	94.42287110005738
18429. from high in the tree the whole block lay within	range of the eye but the ground was almost nowhere visible	3049.4364943567653
18430. one looked	down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower	785.820027682622
18431. every path from	back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor and every yard had its	fruit trees	2593.5826926217173
18432. in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers	had planted syringa and sweet-shrub snowball rose-of-sharon and	balm-of-gilead	1733.1697221577201
18433. from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse	of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham	skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor	or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter	of garments hung there half-way down the block	7740.617318728199
18434. that was one	epoch: the apple-tree epoch	93.7223589346157
18435. another had ended before it began	64.9057302939888
18436. time	is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays	with memory and memory with time are queerest of all	2460.205634336844
18437. from maturity	one looks back at the succession of years counts them and makes them	many yet cannot feel length in the number however large	3898.489499979782
18438. in a	stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond	is quiet its surface dark and shadowed and there does not seem to	be much water in it	3540.2236106325495
18439. time in the sum is nothing	65.30438500913259
18440. and yet- a year to	a child is an eternity and in the memory that phase of one's being-	a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning	and without end	3553.3885747647632
18441. the part of the mind that preserves dates and	events may remonstrate it could have been like that for only a	little while; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds	fast to things that were and they are outside of time	6759.198772675089
18442. once	then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was	bound round by fences when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough	to twist my knee over it and pull myself up	4216.915542072231
18443. that world was in	scale with my own smallness	391.9408403922149
18444. it was	mother who planted the verbenas	140.96213264951422
18445. i think that my grandmother was not	an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and	grandchildren	1877.1035931756116
18446. these my	grandmother left in their places	and planted others like	them that flourished without careful tending	1413.764204718173
18447. three of these only	were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses whose petals	might not be collected until they had fallen to be made into perfume	or rose-tea to drink; the peonies whose tight sticky buds would	be blighted by the laying on of a finger although they were not apparently	harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies	8569.070033135456
18448. i	have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer	morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than	my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap unfolded and shook out	like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals	4814.131661325133
18449. other flowers	we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath	the lilacs; the lilacs themselves that bloomed so prodigally but	for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms	that	turned upside down make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little	dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere	7616.780953336152
18450. more	potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a	few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae	which are of the very stuff of the mind intrinsic because they	were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that	held them	5463.776666167145
18451. flowers stones and small creatures living and dead	251.42234411346303
18452. fuzzy caterpillars snails with their sensitive horns	struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded	to spit tobacco spit	3051.63316782116
18453. dead fledgling birds their squashed-looking	nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they	had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags	3220.9396563536893
18454. and	the	cast shell of a locust straw-colored and transparent weighing nothing	fragile but entire with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down	its back	4091.6795122390768
18455. every morning early in the summer we searched the trunks	of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells carefully	detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung and stabled	them a weird faery herd in an angle between the high roots of the	tulip tree where no grass grew in the dense shade h	5583.547418897026
18456. we collected	lucky stones- all the creamy translucent pebbles worn smooth	and round that we could find in the driveway	2819.469325708989
18457. when these had been	pocketed we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles	for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their	dull exteriors indicated	3313.4973518721577
18458. we showed them to each other and said would	you have guessed h	1186.4295469597612
18459. squatting on our haunches beside the	flat stone we broke them on we were safe behind the high closed gates	at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation	and possible amusement of the passers-by	4033.86602053139
18460. thus shielded we played	many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the	fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post	was the sleeping beauty's enchanted castle or when rapunzel let	down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire even then we paid	little heed to those who went by on the path outside	8110.756224518387
18461. we enjoyed	a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school	781.1055955450349
18462. in	the heat of the summer the garden solitudes were ours alone; our	elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch	4109.375715646544
18463. they	never troubled themselves about us while we were playing because	the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside	the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation	3338.4056752674333
18464. we were	not however entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street	1178.3293575546165
18465. we were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they sag on their	hinges in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on them when they	were latched rest our chins on the top and stare and stare committing	to memory quite unintentionally all the details that lay before	our eyes	5009.521859637802
18466. the street that is full now of traffic and parked	cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade	of the curbside trees and silence was a weight almost palpable	in the air	6064.048062770492
18467. every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell	away again crushed beneath it	934.95868947214
18468. a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter	the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees and loose	straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves	4811.960855872316
18469. a wheel squeaked	on a hub was still and squeaked again	502.2036329744039
18470. if a child watched its progress	he whispered hay hay load of hay- make a wish and turn	away and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the	sound of the horses' feet returned no more	5918.4102212517
18471. when the hay wagon had	gone and an interval passed a huckster's cart might turn the corner	1419.6052777465343
18472. the horse walked the reins were slack the huckster rode with bowed	shoulders his forearms across his knees	2346.850325350347
18473. sleepily as if half-reluctant	to break the silence he lifted his voice: rhu-beb-ni-ice	fresh rhu-beb today! the lazy sing-song was spaced in time	like the drone of a bumble-bee	3112.2126722368243
18474. no one seemed to hear him no one heeded	393.99242149256395
18475. the horse plodded on and he repeated his call	261.18650322343484
18476. it became so monotonous	as to seem a part of the quietness	961.0840690379844
18477. after his passage the street	was empty again	168.02882327831244
18478. the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down;	the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk from sidewalk	to lawn	3062.4078780547816
18479. at four-o'clock or four-thirty the coming of the newsboy	marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front	door and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read	what their neighbors had been doing	4401.082968909841
18480. the streets of any county	town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were	like this fifty-odd years ago and yesterday	3675.5921569007246
18481. but the fences were still	in place fifty-odd years ago and when we stood on the gate to look	over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving	stones with grass between and on both sides	4295.540576366445
18482. the curb was a line	of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost	in the ground or the roots of trees	4464.048614646917
18483. opposite every gate was a hitching	post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tying	a horse	2042.5144943582459
18484. the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center;	it was mud in wet weather and dust ankle-deep in dry and could	be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones	5502.68555572062
18485. it had	a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since	499.72985821383907
18486. the hoofmarks of	cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as	numerous as the traces of shod horses	4120.0444446660385
18487. cows were kept in backyard barns	boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge	of town and familiar to the ear morning and evening were the boys'	coaxing voices the thud of hooves and the thwack of a stick on cowhide	4768.232997010172
18488. it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story	because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and	makes of them a curious riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant	for mann's work	5909.552466316614
18489. the wife amra and her lover are	both savagely portrayed she as incarnate sensuality voluptuous	and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind	of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike	brain	3859.1479724263545
18490. la^utner for his part belonged to the present-day	race of small artists who do not demand the utmost of themselves	and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets	as wretched little poseurs the devastating indictment they	do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat	extreme prophecy so far not fulfilled: they will be destroyed	8412.350036317597
18491. the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want	not simply of decency but of imagination as well	1716.1999872400797
18492. his appearance as	lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle	absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed	by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation	5782.766297351393
18493. at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat	man as girl and as baby as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches	for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby's	upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human	life	4895.591524874765
18494. the music which la^utner has composed for this episode	is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal	2597.0900614945303
18495. but	it is characteristic of him we are told his little artifice	to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of	hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art	3547.1552796370115
18496. and this occurs	now at the refrain of jacoby's song- at the point in fact of	the name lizzy-; a modulation described as almost a stroke	of genius	4479.500238076428
18497. a miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly	torn away to reveal something nude	1252.776979132641
18498. it is this modulation	which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously	his wife's infidelity	2128.354754315214
18499. by the same means he perceives this fact	as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses and dies	1738.3409833524008
18500. in the work of every artist i suppose there may be found	one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive	ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly	so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of	thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment	7874.659962479421
18501. when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that	this passage is of critical significance i come up with the following	ideas which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in	a later essay	6058.240405802722
18502. love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann's	heroes	371.38410108540376
18503. the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically	turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled	and forbidden to love	3040.7962749702997
18504. the release the freedom involved in loving	another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible;	and the motion toward it brings disaster	2321.4046725365224
18505. this prohibition	on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly	the artist who suffers	from it	2826.878914879253
18506. the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem	of the breakthrough in the realm of art	1731.7568242272177
18507. again the sufferings	and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment	not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another	with childhood with the figure of a child	5156.461482094486
18508. finally the	theatrical notions of dressing up cosmetics	disguise and especially change of costume	are characteristically associated with the catastrophes	of mann's stories	2320.065977512978
18509. we shall return to these statements	and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates	2366.161792847076
18510. for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of	jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together	in prophetic parody	3092.6372964646034
18511. professionally a lawyer that is to say associated	with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially	middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself	dressed up disguised- that is paradoxically revealed- as a	child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child	7152.715526542079
18512. it appears that the dominant tendency of	mann's early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface	is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic	4103.905361725998
18513. in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his	stories are one and the same	1738.5478975533802
18514. something of this can be learned	from the way to the churchyard an anecdote about	an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die	of a stroke or seizure	5683.906385481624
18515. there is no more plot than that; only	slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident	would give	2034.5498125928461
18516. the artistic interest then lies in what the encounter	may be made to represent in the power of some central significance	to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness	4638.344246578239
18517. the first	sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent:	the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran	beside it all the way to the end; that is to say to the churchyard	3957.042941003575
18518. and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction	753.2319263316471
18519. the highroad one might say at first belongs to life while	the way to the churchyard belongs to death	1722.2260415154128
18520. but that is too simple	and won't hold up	394.67127000556945
18521. as the first sentence suggests both roads belong	to death in the end	787.9666769778039
18522. but the highroad according to the description	of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death	while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life:	a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness	of death	7010.897421119875
18523. thus on the highroad a troop of soldiers marched in their	own dust and sang while on the footpath one man walks alone	2321.980480070079
18524. this man's isolation is not merely momentary it is permanent	561.8765337899873
18525. he is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on	earth; also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account	3116.4259245384887
18526. his	name is praisegod piepsam and he is rather fully described as to	his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister	type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic	strangers in death in venice for example who represent	some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp	7774.689741566561
18527. this strange	person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path	rather than the highroad	1584.604499969044
18528. the cyclist a sufficiently commonplace	young fellow is not named but identified simply as life- that	and a license number which piepsam uses in addressing him	4112.4854332270925
18529. life	points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride	on	787.1016912756388
18530. piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest	from life and is left standing in impotent and growing rage	while a crowd begins to gather	4841.017857204045
18531. his rage assumes a religious form;	that is on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness	piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god	imprecates doom on life- not only the cyclist now but the audience	the world as well: all you light-headed breed	5111.709436429405
18532. this passion	brings on a fit which proves fatal	394.1692970297085
18533. then an ambulance comes along	and they drive praisegod piepsam away	504.8844252021169
18534. this is simple enough	but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant	1647.5600969459088
18535. the	season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree	aspect	788.2819378047064
18536. piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot	stop the cyclist but also because god will not stop him; as piepsam	says to the crowd in his last moments: his justice is not of	this world	5942.997885290865
18537. life is further characterized in antithesis to	piepsam as animal: the image of a dog which appears at several	places is first given as the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest	aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon	is admirable a pleasure to contemplate; another wagon	has no dog and therefore is devoid of interest	5541.057009981052
18538. piepsam calls	the cyclist cur and puppy among other things and at the crisis	of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into	his face	4487.062001780063
18539. the ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses	262.0946252550489
18540. piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense	391.78729586624775
18541. his religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with	his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical	1408.0448463492341
18542. his unsuccessful	strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings;	he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe praisegod	piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in	his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated	7331.919426706341
18543. the cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed is simply	unreflective unproblematic life blithe and carefree	1106.0864341127992
18544. he	made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth	1405.7543448213748
18545. piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous	and trivial	642.453384229016
18546. he is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard	961.5206923830896
18547. but he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from	the highroad to watch him more interesting than life considered	as a cyclist	2758.619560928347
18548. and if i have gone into so much detail about so small	a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the	germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann's writing:	the crude sketch of piepsam contains in its critical destructive	and self-destructive tendencies much that is enlarged and illuminated	in the figures of for instance naphta and leverku^hn	8626.144630211216
18549. in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details	selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism	anticipates a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional	composition in which as leverku^hn says there shall be	nothing unthematic	4748.44021953446
18550. it resembles too pictures such as du^rer	and bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial	proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a	proverb for example or a deadly sin	6180.258914414531
18551. gladius dei	resembles the way to the churchyard in its representation	of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit	of criticism negation melancholy but it goes considerably further	in characterizing the elements of this conflict	4137.977962848808
18552. the monk savonarola	brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background	of munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious	works displayed in the art-shop of m bluthenzweig; in	particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled	according to gossip upon the painter's mistress	7653.528374141752
18553. hieronymus	like piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though	not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out	of the shop by the porter	3231.6237631792096
18554. on the street outside hieronymus envisions	a holocaust of the vanities of this world such a burning of artistic	and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in	florence and prophetically he issues his curse: gladius dei	super terram cito et velociter	6795.298803882533
18555. the reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their	art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and	empty world	2618.6666142599083
18556. their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason	563.6499225932148
18557. these polar concerns reflect	a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing	over a long period of time	1727.8036242939083
18558. the breakdown of classical structures of	meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations	of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes	4253.294962192163
18559. thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal	and spiritual qualities and complete objectification in sub-human and	quasi-mechanistic powers	2170.1883975701826
18560. the image of the world tends to reflect the	hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces	and overwhelming mystery	3690.2829524842664
18561. the image of god has simply disappeared	94.6652359562063
18562. all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory	response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism:	if man can neither know nor love reality as it is he can at	least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which	can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable	of being known and worthy of being loved	8825.555783377686
18563. the person of the artist	becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by	the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical	systems	3223.2088990937136
18564. whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and	whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding	the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually	exclusive that they belong together	5617.534414874797
18565. without the decay of a	sense of objective reference the	stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into	being	2037.5010571714422
18566. and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves	insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar	authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously	and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid	chapters in the philosophy of art may be written	7750.067482961873
18567. for better or worse	we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of	classical rationalism or detached realism	2036.3248240820626
18568. a broader concept of imitation	is needed one which acknowledges that true invention is important	that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic	causal factors out of which it arises	4984.777077779467
18569. on the other hand we cannot regard	artistic invention as pure uncaused and unrelated to the times	in which it occurs	2027.3752331772946
18570. we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from	the solipsism and futility of pure formalism	2122.022242155964
18571. accordingly it is the	aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation	call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of	and a new theory of invention		2562.6906474979905
18572. the arts	the word mimesis is usually associated	with plato and aristotle	960.3346203548608
18573. for plato imitation is twice	removed from reality being a poor copy of physical appearance which	in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence	2595.3666804387244
18574. all artistic and mythological	representations therefore are imitations of imitations and	are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic the	proper use of the inquiring intellect	4289.346281775141
18575. in plato's judgment the	arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young	prior to the full development of their intellectual powers	2843.6352154465358
18576. presupposed	in plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight in which	a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating	to the most sublime wisdom	4678.734556482096
18577. aristotle also tended to stratify all	aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and	like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level	3230.236931690772
18578. the poetics in affirming that all human arts are modes	of imitation gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than	did plato	3450.457041131519
18579. but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented	it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and	action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and	important human truths	4127.972679553081
18580. for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis	in contrast to the power of dialectic is relatively incapable of	expressing the character of fundamental reality	3689.5124807958114
18581. the central	concern of erich auerbach's impressive volume called mimesis	is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation	to a christian theory of imitation	in which the levels are dissolved	3571.406115443003
18582. following the theme of incarnation	in the gospels the christian artist and critic sees in the most	commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality	4291.72610049035
18583. here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation	in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent	1577.9678655382609
18584. artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement	of all persons however humble in a divine drama	2112.779206513661
18585. the artist unlike	the philosopher is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified	high levels of abstraction	1737.8096553672701
18586. he is the conveyor of a sacred reality	by which he has been grasped	1415.1750861530581
18587. i have chosen to use the word mimesis	in its christian rather than its classic implications and	to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological	expression which as in the christian mind are the direct consequence	of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved	as in the greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection	5613.9701530087395
18588. in the first instance mimesis is here used to mean the	recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms	of abstract ideas or conventional designations	4636.568546168547
18589. by image is meant	not only a visual presentation but also remembered sensations of any	of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined	therewith	2866.0290207043968
18590. this is the primary function of the imagination operating	in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images	were first appropriated	3682.5689409195875
18591. mimesis is the nearest possible thing to	the actual re-living of experience in which the imagining person recovers	through images something of the force and depth characteristic	of experience itself	3227.752524773091
18592. the images themselves like their counterparts	in experience are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately;	they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities	and a unique relatedness to one another	5625.415201322037
18593. they bring an inextricable	component of value within themselves with attractions and repulsions	native to their own quality	1574.4817239804343
18594. as in experience one is seized by	given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in	value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation	of images	5341.459232690664
18595. mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism	or realism in the conventional sense	1103.6318018085644
18596. a word taken in its dictionary	meaning a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing	of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote	such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without	the incitement of value feelings	6552.713760182414
18597. similarly experience itself can	be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues	for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential	field	2594.263746545391
18598. a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection	to a sense of immediacy	1415.2718006942036
18599. the mimetic character of the	imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation	of artistic forms and materials	1727.46749203843
18600. these	are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self	and thrusts the self into decision and choice	2339.1310120774842
18601. the presence of genuine	mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work	demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely	understood	4495.0097340531565
18602. underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain	presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which	require some exposition before the main argument can proceed	2615.783586568368
18603. experience	is not seen as it is in classical rationalism as presenting	us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space	and	registering their character movements and changes on the tabula	rasa of an uninvolved intellect	6078.6575121706555
18604. neither is primary experience understood	according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing	is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing	their responses in the appropriate sense organs	3651.524064388187
18605. primary feelings	of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects	nor a collection of isolated and	neutral sensory qualities	3493.9931693808458
18606. in contrast to all this primary data are	data of a self involved in environing processes and powers	1575.6339678240977
18607. the	most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings both positive	and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment	into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other	part	5789.963959998167
18608. these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers	in which one is involved some working for one's good others threatening	ill	2187.9138652478096
18609. gone is the tabula rasa of the mind	250.016848218327
18610. in its place	is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive	or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined	by constellations of process in which one is caught	3768.9993356846508
18611. the principal	defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy	is alfred north whitehead	1876.7947939717008
18612. our most elemental and unavoidable	impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of	powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated	in a vast movement through the present toward the future	4209.833101368335
18613. we feel the	quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening	1659.3881846497636
18614. later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors	of judgment in these apprehensions of value but the apprehensions themselves	are the primary stuff of experience	2590.980136726118
18615. it takes a great deal	of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger	unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a	collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern	devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far	as they present themselves for inspection	8348.467711811589
18616. whitehead is here questioning	david hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he	is questioning also every epistemology which stems from hume's	presupposition	that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from	causal efficacy and that causal efficacy is something intellectually	imputed to the world not directly perceived	4830.464108743388
18617. what hume calls sensation	is what whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational	immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception	in the mode of causal efficacy	4461.305072580357
18618. as long as perception is seen as	composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness	of existence loses its objectivity becomes an invention	of consciousness and the result is a philosophical scepticism	3868.523794125541
18619. whitehead	contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity	of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other	and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because	the basic form of such an understanding for all its vagueness and	tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man	feels the world	8473.967782021386
18620. in this respect experience is broader and full of	a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of	his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct	3654.582196024473
18621. a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is	one of derivation from the past	2356.183656643485
18622. both i and my feelings come up out	of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are	ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am	3433.997254825321
18623. after only eighteen years of non-interference there were already indications	of melioration though in a slight degree to be sure	2813.7585171548094
18624. there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century	168.4163924883111
18625. i leave	it to the statisticians to say what they were but i noticed several	a few years ago during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg	4271.327087946127
18626. in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school	and the white school and in every instance the former made a better	appearance	2601.4054539283347
18627. it really looked as if a	change of the sort predicted by booker t washington had been going	on	2595.247566033766
18628. but with the renewal of interference in 1954	the improvement was impaired	636.3867938630294
18629. for over a hundred	years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them	1626.5333735215559
18630. it's infuriating this feeling that one is being picked on continually	constantly	645.0870679169369
18631. by what right of superior virtue southerners ask	do the people of the north do this	1875.5534025656968
18632. the traditional strategy of the	south has been to expose the vices of the north to demonstrate that	the north possessed no superior virtue to show the world that	however	bad i may be you're not quite the people to say it	4360.388049508767
18633. in the pre-civil war years the south argued that the slave was	not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north	3469.0451669046415
18634. at	the present time the counter-attack takes the line that there's no	more of the true spirit of integration in the north than	in the south	2728.191938935124
18635. the line is a pretty good one	142.0165438172241
18636. people talk about	the law of the land	167.89533833234833
18637. the expression has become quite a cliche	140.68613202382636
18638. but people can't be made to integrate socialize	by law	372.7693467532823
18639. i was having lunch not	long ago with three distinguished	historians	and i asked them if they	could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed	with deliberate speed majestic instancy	by judicial fiat	5789.3213098933975
18640. they didn't seem to be able to think of any	370.05984326419906
18641. a virginia	judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years	might be a reasonable length of time for such a change	4277.008531454232
18642. but i suspect	that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation-	the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he	said they make a desert and call it peace		2849.5062862143063
18643. moreover the law of the land is not	irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been many times	2357.5836947975595
18644. mr	justice taney's dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the	north and soon became a dead letter	1724.1352016998949
18645. prohibition was the law of the	land but it was unpopular	in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially	and was repealed	3683.2884339114935
18646. the cliche loses	its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history	785.9813497428804
18647. the	declaration of independence says that governments derive their	just powers from the consent of the governed	2124.1233343222452
18648. the phrase consent	of the governed needs a hard look	374.02068189052704
18649. how do we define it	22.168896201036965
18650. is the	consent of the governed a numerical majority	261.9458209830625
18651. calhoun dealt with	this question in his disquisition on government	557.6798578562023
18652. to guard	against the tyranny of a numerical majority calhoun developed his	theory of concurrent majority which he said by giving to	each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the	action of government a negative on the others prevents all partial	or local legislation	4823.101828718745
18653. who will say that our country is even now a	homogeneous community	966.2298209603053
18654. that regional peculiarities do not still exist	93.50120704713514
18655. that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region	751.7219907683045
18656. who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal	action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of the consent	of the governed	2736.639072098508
18657. circumstances alter cases	0.30041514999999996
18658. a friend	of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular	trouble out there that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell	2995.102944329431
18659. he	seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular	trouble anywhere	1399.20883711134
18660. i murmured something about a possible difference between	new mexico's history and mississippi's	790.8219115454515
18661. one can meet	with aloofness almost anywhere: the thank-heaven-we're-not-involved	viewpoint it doesn't affect us! southern liberals	- especially if they're rich- often exhibit	blithe insouciance	2519.347927416684
18662. the trouble here is that it's almost too easy	to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything	2028.4795651243853
18663. you've already sent your daughter to miss x's select academy	for girls and your son to mr y's select academy for boys and	you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity	5496.946686363253
18664. if there's	no suitable academy in your own neighborhood there's always new	england	781.9351674482458
18665. new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces	south as well as west	1199.2415482269244
18666. they may even enroll a colored student	or two for show though he usually turns out to be from thailand or	any place other than the american south	2994.9984640407038
18667. it would be interesting to	know how much integration there is in the famous fashionable colleges	and prep schools of new england	3262.7261963058936
18668. a recent newspaper report	said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one	thousand at yale; that is about one-half of one per cent which	looks pretty tokenish to me especially in an institution which	professes to be national	4438.313672004647
18669. i must confess that i prefer	the liberal who is personally affected who is willing to send his own	children to a mixed school as proof of his faith	4650.979060624501
18670. i leave out of account	the question of the best interests of the children the question	of what their best interests really are	2325.3938498469247
18671. i'm talking about the grand	manner of the liberal- north and south- who is not affected	personally	2122.9004437454923
18672. if these people were denied a voice	what voices would be left	642.2506862857585
18673. who is involved	willy nilly	22.259387069505514
18674. well after everybody has followed the new england	pattern of segregating one's children into private schools	only the poor folks are left	2186.8244469822594
18675. and it is precisely in this poorer economic	class that one finds and has always found the most racial friction	2834.9038673953223
18676. a dear respected friend of mine who like myself grew up	in the south and has spent many years in new england said to me	not long ago: i can't forgive new england for rejecting	all complicity	3939.0076834711326
18677. being a teacher of american literature i remembered	whittier's massachusetts to virginia where he said:	but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone	and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown	5766.579011710777
18678. there	is a legend	to the effect that the	mayflower	on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves	1882.0985322087643
18679. whether	historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value	1193.5618551713446
18680. complicity is an embarrassing word	14.879316202645182
18681. it is something	which most of us try to get out from under	1170.9331636062648
18682. like the cowboy in stephen	crane's blue hotel we run around crying well i	didn't do anything did i	1725.0495753805876
18683. robert penn warren puts it this	way in brother to dragons: the recognition of complicity	is the beginning of innocence where innocence i think means	about the same thing as redemption	4996.395403451874
18684. a man must be able to say father	i have sinned	or there is no hope for him	1571.6391915558984
18685. lincoln understood	this better than most when he said in his second inaugural	that god gives to both north and south this terrible war as the	woe due to those by whom the offense came	5630.460233603419
18686. he also spoke of the	wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited	toil	1578.7738486977055
18687. lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that	a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of	the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade	5006.3664838430905
18688. after	how many generations is such wealth	purified of taint	371.7895716640395
18689. it is a question	which new englanders long ago put out of their minds	1407.4161965916082
18690. but didn't	they get off too easy	94.34486137217553
18691. the slaves never shared in their profits	while they did share in a very real sense in the profits of the	slave-owners: they were fed clothed doctored and so forth; they	were the beneficiaries of responsible paternalistic care	6049.749030919702
18692. emerson- platonist idealist doctrinaire- sounded a high transcendental	note in his boston hymn delivered in 1863 in the boston music	hall amidst thundering applause: pay ransom to the owner and	fill the bag to the brim	3861.736432664823
18693. who is the owner	4.410088542847619
18694. the slave is owner	and ever was	93.08395031106613
18695. pay him! it is the abstractionism the unrealism	of the pure idealist	968.416802848866
18696. it ignores the sordid financial aspects	conveniently too for his audience who could indulge in moral indignation	without visible or even conscious discomfort their money	from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic		3141.6759927111248
18697. like pilate they had washed their hands	140.50369899382534
18698. but can one	really	2.9568817754754355
18699. can god be mocked ever in the long run	391.81192088503013
18700. our northern brethren also	i believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their	people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable	carriers of them to others	5326.855596579151
18701. but that was a long	time ago	94.06031394867054
18702. the new england conscience became desensitized	64.94856889490285
18703. george	w cable writing in 1889 from paradise	road northampton agitated continuously	the southern question	1104.655568506561
18704. it was nice to be able to isolate	it	388.8579066639772
18705. new england as everyone knows has long been schoolmaster	to the nation	643.7095023518448
18706. there one finds concentrated in a comparatively	small area the chief universities colleges and preparatory schools	of the united states	2820.7518749216893
18707. why should this be so	14.860976962635249
18708. it is true that new	england more than any other section was dedicated to education	from the start	2350.625898764215
18709. but i think that something more than this is involved	374.92294493010047
18710. how did it happen for example that the state university	that great symbol of american democracy failed to flourish in new england	as it did in other parts of the country	4971.294888881945
18711. isn't it a bit odd	that the three states of southern new england	have had state institutions of university	status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously	been a+m colleges	3543.5572587340876
18712. was it supposed perchance that	a+m was quite sufficient for the	immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in	the post-civil war period the immigrants having been brought in from	southern europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor	shortage caused by migration to the west	7778.373480438619
18713. is it not ironical that	roger williams's state rhode island should have been the very	last of the forty-eight to establish a state university	2477.3593217250223
18714. the state	universities of maine new hampshire and vermont are older and more	respectable; they had less immigration to contend with	3039.5612412798246
18715. a yale historian writing a few years ago in the yale review	said: we in new england have long since segregated our children	2319.2076752301696
18716. he was referring not only to the general college situation	but more especially to the preparatory schools	2132.1537255559347
18717. and what a galaxy of	those adorns that fair land! i don't propose to go into their history	but i have one or two surmises	2597.872602656261
18718. one is that they were established	or gained eminence under pressure provided by these same immigrants	from whom the old families wished to segregate their children	4113.604275875553
18719. in the early days of a homogeneous population the public school was	quite satisfactory	942.7729879662724
18720. among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature	more than half are practically unknown to readers of english	2584.4935691923156
18721. of these	there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than	verner von heidenstam the swedish poet and novelist who received	the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago	3765.9310322902006
18722. equally a master of prose and verse he recreates the glory of sweden	in the past and continues it into the present	3279.058521168182
18723. in the following sketch	we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as	possible speak for himself	2324.362012157616
18724. heidenstam was born in 1859 of	a prosperous family	392.42235714405564
18725. on his father's side he was of german descent	on his mother's he came of the old swedish nobility	1732.7402793015626
18726. the family	estate was situated near vadstena on lake va^ttern in south central	sweden	1412.6041335253153
18727. it is a lonely rather desolate region but full of legendary	and historic associations	934.3679614027362
18728. as a boy in a local school he was shy	and solitary absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of	sweden's ancient glory	3884.3463854965826
18729. he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain	and to dress for the part	944.9115636396903
18730. being somewhat delicate in health at the	age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe for which he at once	developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten	years abroad at first in italy then in greece egypt asia minor	and palestine	7192.900838725965
18731. in one of his summers at home he married to the	great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth	2310.962471531977
18732. deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of gerome	in paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found	that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction	5753.1631566751375
18733. he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem the	happy artists	1258.3400902630378
18734. i scanned the world through printed symbol	swart and through the beggar's rags i strove to see the inner man	2829.443867191295
18735. i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart	638.5015745906776
18736. in this final line we have the key to his nature	753.6502185832128
18737. few writers	have better understood their deepest selves	167.93789243353302
18738. heidenstam could never be	satisfied by surface	141.1359544718021
18739. it may however be noted that his gift for color	and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris	2165.267202256517
18740. the first result of heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was	a volume of poems pilgrimage and wander-years	published in 1888	2577.3852126758475
18741. it was a brilliant debut so much so	indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets as did byron's	childe harold	2457.0192751455793
18742. professor fredrik bo^o^k sweden's	foremost critic of the period acclaims it as follows: in	this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful plastic racy	vivid	4281.080547536626
18743. in a bold sometimes careless form there is nothing academic;	all is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp	and the imagination lively	2606.053160832974
18744. the young poet-painter reproduces the french	life of the streets; he tells stories of the thousand and one	nights and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus	4475.981292029659
18745. in the	care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the	old happy existence and for that reason he loves it	2462.446750644305
18746. and yet amid all	the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of	short poems thoughts in loneliness filled with brooding melancholy	and sombre longing	4296.236919836712
18747. of the longer pieces of the volume	none is so memorable as nameless and immortal which at	once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language	3237.311245592225
18748. it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of	neptune at paestum next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian	classic style now in existence	4273.908632869114
18749. on the eve of his return to their	native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises	before them in its completed perfection	2724.786875617863
18750. the supreme object of their	lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality	2122.1064991852177
18751. not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple	that is immortal	1095.9273780089804
18752. the man's true reputation is his work	141.21184630628846
18753. the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as thoughts	in loneliness is as professor bo^o^k indicated in sharp contrast	with the others	2608.9007301172765
18754. it consists of fragmentary personal revelations	such as the spark: there is a spark dwells deep within	my soul	2592.4475676773714
18755. to get it out into the daylight's glow is my life's	aim both first and last the whole	1579.3674605670706
18756. it slips away it burns and tortures	me	249.76622139410898
18757. that little spark is all the wealth i know that little spark	is my life's misery	1258.3083368437885
18758. a dominant motive is the poet's longing	for his homeland and its boyhood associations: not men-folk but	the fields where i would stray the stones where as a child i used	to play	5344.3727523286625
18759. he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory	life he has been leading	1098.411675961142
18760. what he really wants is to find a	sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself	2124.03931880566
18761. this restless	individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all	the rest of his life in sweden	1867.8393607686448
18762. his cause was to commemorate the glory	of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present	3020.9218720203535
18763. he did not however find himself at once	165.4071252227713
18764. his next major	work completed in 1892 was a long fantastic epic in prose entitled	hans alienus which professor bo^o^k describes as a monument	on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth	5346.544246660326
18765. the hero who is	himself is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east	a sort of faustus type who to quote from professor bo^o^k again	even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from	his painful search after the meaning of life	4846.13021675778
18766. he is driven back by	his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of	tiveden	2583.305014738576
18767. from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his	deeper self	499.4795757773434
18768. by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession	of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions	3274.653253878886
18769. he	did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were	785.1735016702389
18770. like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little	patience with collective mediocrity	1421.5215404634316
18771. he saw sweden as a country of	smug and narrow provincialism indifferent to the heroic spirit of its	former glory	1877.8181316735383
18772. strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear	down the old structures and build anew from the ground up	2597.867727298992
18773. heidenstam's	conception on the contrary was to revive the present by the memories	of the past	1256.72331031902
18774. whether in prose or poetry all of heidenstam's	later work was concerned with sweden	1407.0603277251712
18775. with the first of a group	of historical novels the charles men published	in 1897-8 he achieved the masterpiece of his career	2187.385627563367
18776. in scope	and power it can only be compared to tolstoy's war and peace	1413.2848619394751
18777. about one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better	coordinated more concise and more dramatic	1576.6667537108624
18778. though it centers around	the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 the true hero	is not finally the king himself	3056.7857766559823
18779. hence the title of the book referring	to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield	of poltava to quote from the novel the wreath he twined for	himself slipped down upon his people	3939.2168447968884
18780. the charles men	consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories	each depicting a special phase of the general subject	3884.7200666624353
18781. somewhat uneven	in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among	the finest of their kind in literature	2182.4479272163053
18782. they comprise a great variety	of scene and interest: grim episodes of war idyllic interludes superb	canvases of world-shaking events and delightfully humorous sketches	of odd characters	4266.128481401503
18783. the general effect is tragic	14.891231272787854
18784. almost nothing	is said of charles' spectacular victories the central theme being	the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune	and defeat	4289.296262884427
18785. to carry out this exalted conception the	author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed	in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale	3340.0569591170306
18786. his	peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity	754.9634439432032
18787. george	meredith has said that fervor is the core of style	502.21412547711543
18788. of few authors	is this more true than of heidenstam	559.1754306793445
18789. the charles men has a tremendous	range of characters of common folk even more than of major	figures	1561.282900586612
18790. the career of charles 12 is obviously very similar to that	of napoleon	1180.5274849882185
18791. his ideal was alexander of macedon as napoleon's	was julius caesar	505.25774195435315
18792. his purpose however was not to establish an	empire but to assert the principle of divine justice	2103.961456498044
18793. each aspired	to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god	1722.9474464052787
18794. each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought	ruin on the country that worshipped him	2367.138133172674
18795. each is still glorified	as a national hero	168.94518590364
18796. the first half of the charles men	ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 is more dramatically	coherent than the second	3911.585598141398
18797. after the collapse of that desperate	and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a	time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous	3112.12458785309
18798. like napoleon he was the worst of losers	250.690104579373
18799. there are however some	wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning	the reactions of the swedes in adversity	2031.0156145327467
18800. then more than ever before	did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness	1177.9453068091748
18801. this comes	out in when the bells ring which describes the rallying of the	peasants in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the danes	2589.8743393863165
18802. in the king's ride charles breaks out of a long period	of petulance and inertia regains his old self escapes from turkey	and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years	5488.953204290892
18803. he finds it in utter misery and desolation	167.02393786175148
18804. all his people ask for	is no more war	392.9840105569283
18805. but he plunges into yet another this time with norway	and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall being	only thirty-six years of age when he died	3211.815557345167
18806. he had become king at fifteen	65.62769145672576
18807. then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular	feeling	374.2285916718446
18808. from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol	of all that was noblest and best in the history of sweden	3690.8173217298036
18809. this is	brought out in the next to last chapter of the book a hero's	funeral written in the form of an impassioned prose poem	2608.5459948025227
18810. slowly	the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside	the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral the shrine	of so many precious memories	4481.235195956105
18811. the guns are fired the hymns are	sung and the body of charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside	the tombs of his ancestors	2859.121751206553
18812. as he had longed to be he became the	echo of a saga	1186.328047867904
18813. heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction	about earlier figures revered in swedish memory	942.8586219409328
18814. excellent in their	way they lack the wide appeal of the charles men and need	not detain us here	2579.2490172677735
18815. it is different with his volume the swedes	and their chieftains a history	intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high	school students	2611.82689481475
18816. admirably written it is a perfect introduction to swedish	history for readers of other countries	1648.7939726399704
18817. some of the earlier episodes	have touches of the supernatural as suited to the legendary background	1257.6268932916091
18818. these are suggestive of selma lagerlo^f	64.52960610936161
18819. especially touching	is the chapter the little sister about a king's daughter	who became a nun in the convent of st birgitta	2184.1096797051414
18820. the record	teems with romance and adventure	140.4121123935414
18821. gustaf vasa is a superb example	and charles 10 the conqueror of denmark hardly less so	1259.3007426108902
18822. of	gustavus adolphus and charles 12 it is unnecessary to speak	753.4772435259345
18823. today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or	handle divorce cases but his primary function remains what it has always	been to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with	those who have not	4031.813370451388
18824. it is from this unpromising background that the	fictional private detective was recruited	1178.6883931212183
18825. the mythological	private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential	ways	1101.3714520360274
18826. on the one hand he does not work for a large agency but	is almost always self-employed	2112.441121453185
18827. as a free-lance investigator the fictional	detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client	1423.5981600291657
18828. for this reason he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure	whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a	9 to 5 routine	4303.393506399371
18829. on the other hand the fictional detective does not	break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of	asking him to do such things	2858.3937984193226
18830. whatever his original assignment the	fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime usually	a murder	2609.2008283316545
18831. operating as a one man police force in fact if not in	name he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police	themselves	2750.6736977606947
18832. he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to	do so but because he enjoys	his work because he firmly believes that murder must be punished	4293.341890963869
18833. thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman	504.4694746921047
18834. he is first and foremost a defender of public morals a servant of	society	1416.0339956008552
18835. it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and	public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological	detective	2041.4051808259399
18836. by virtue of his self-reliance his individualism and	his freedom from external restraint the private eye is a perfect embodiment	of the middle class conception of liberty which amounts to doing	what you please and let the devil take the hindmost	6462.256366950192
18837. at the same time	because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal	dictates of his society because he likes to catch criminals he is	in middle class eyes a virtuous man	3654.6639762653344
18838. in this way the private detective	gets the best of two possible worlds	1189.0522771837454
18839. he is an individualist but	not an anarchist; he is a public servant but not a cop	1422.75623535852
18840. in short the	fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam smith's	ideal entrepreneur the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere	promote the public welfare	4514.584084255999
18841. in the mystery story as in the	wealth of nations individualism and the social good are two sides	of the same benevolent coin	2331.316622514701
18842. there is only one	catch to this idyllic arrangement: adam smith was wrong	1180.9176558085378
18843. not only	did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest	number he ended by destroying himself by giving birth to monopoly	capitalism	2728.7127854978075
18844. the rise of the giant corporations in western europe	and the united states dates from the period 1880-1900	2355.922745806177
18845. now although	the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far	as balzac dickens and poe it was not until the closing decades	of the 19th century that the private detective became an established	figure in popular fiction	4388.083071758299
18846. sherlock holmes the ancestor of all private	eyes was born during the 1890s	1184.0425851949929
18847. AVERAGE PERPLEXITY:	1583.463230799964
