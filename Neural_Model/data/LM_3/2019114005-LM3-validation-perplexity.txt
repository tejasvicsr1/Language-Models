SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. thus the transformation of adam	smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides	closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life	2473.2376244947345
2. driven	from the marketplace by the course of history our hero disguises	himself as a private detective	2122.5929989766087
3. the birth of the myth compensates	for the death of the ideal	643.7451046346652
4. even on the fictional level however	the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully	resolved	2585.031803409146
5. the individualism and public service of the private detective	both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct:	he enforces the law without being told to do so	3233.175606581426
6. the private eye is therefore	a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society	2118.230360897194
7. the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between	good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal	2325.2567697900154
8. unfortunately this assumption does not always hold good	251.0067451959745
9. as	capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon	force and violence for its survival the private detective is placed	in a serious dilemma	2751.336548548555
10. if he is good he may not be legal; if he is	legal he may not be good	2341.1858836306915
11. it is the gradual unfolding and deepening	of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution	of the mystery story	2172.4633977050908
12. with the advent of sir arthur	conan doyle's sherlock holmes the development of the modern private	detective begins	2360.4062254964606
13. sherlock holmes is not merely an individualist;	he is very close to being a mental case	1265.8021386265966
14. a brief list of the great	detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide dr freud with	ample food for thought	2358.7023810399623
15. holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and	other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances	induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse an incredible	egotist a confirmed misogynist	3774.8311520852358
16. holmes rebels against the social	conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds	2109.0993844670534
17. his	eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom	167.58807925451114
18. it was in order	to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became	a detective in the first place	3263.3905909276664
19. as he informs watson my life is	spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence	1724.7968949515798
20. these little problems help me to do so	250.52539239645085
21. holmes is a public servant	to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears	1574.6212646132244
22. the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard	provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric	behavior	2812.985476705974
23. although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland	yard holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality	of the police	2321.0556746478837
24. they for their part are convinced that holmes	is too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective	2358.9153706040897
25. why do the police find holmes unorthodox	93.73203565030038
26. on the face of	it it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official	police routine	2116.34283093417
27. another more interesting explanation is hinted at by	watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have	made a magnificent criminal	2331.257851650499
28. the great detective modestly agrees	22.306034218404672
29. watson's	insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes	and his arch-opponent dr moriarty	1092.8205143316236
30. the two men resemble each other	closely in their cunning their egotism their relentlessness	1409.4583552840827
31. the	first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty	grappling together on the edge of a cliff	1882.9141870199996
32. they are presumed	to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace	1404.934404284781
33. linked to holmes	even in death moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great	detective the image of what our hero might have become were he not a	public servant	3105.420246796277
34. just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the	detective so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both	2363.4457743348403
35. in the modern english whodunnit this insinuation of	latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared	1562.4132503937249
36. hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey	have retained	holmes'	egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits	2580.068086205283
37. poirot and	his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that	they are also extremely dull	1408.8929262489257
38. their dedication to the status quo has	been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism	of a sherlock holmes	3271.253743172936
39. the latter's real descendents were unable	to take root in england; they fled from the victorian parlor	and made their way across the stormy atlantic	2594.6942806519573
40. in the american hardboiled	detective story of the '20s and '30s the spirit of the	mad genius from baker street lives on	3295.2444638768125
41. like holmes the	american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time	784.7029986962227
42. but	unlike holmes he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt	1639.8639776381685
43. surrounded by crime and violence everywhere the hardboiled	private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed	isolation	2048.6130714859346
44. his alienation is far more acute than holmes'; he	is not an eccentric but rather an outcast	2119.1694172538364
45. with rex stout's nero	wolfe alienation is represented on a purely physical plane	792.8464629750698
46. wolfe	refuses to ever leave his own house and spends most of his time drinking	beer and playing with orchids	2798.6514313034386
47. more profound and more disturbing	however is the moral isolation of raymond chandler's philip marlowe	1100.6887616086035
48. in a society where everything is for sale marlowe is the only	man who cannot be bought	2133.7580157651178
49. his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary	and difficult existence	500.93228576026
50. beaten bruised and exhausted he pursues	the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low	morals always alone always despised	3262.223789983984
51. in the end he gets his man but	no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward	1887.106178845575
52. a similar	tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers	of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery	stories dashiell hammett's the maltese falcon	4813.404500009519
53. sam spade	joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled	statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last it turns	out to be a fake	3655.609553561785
54. now the detective must save his own skin by informing	on the girl he loves who is also the real murderer	3059.171045655373
55. for sam spade	neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover it is increasingly difficult	to distinguish between the two	1574.6408617747813
56. because the private eye	intends to save society in spite of himself he invariably finds himself	in trouble with the police	3039.7230106645793
57. the latter are either too stupid to	catch the killer or too corrupt to care	1102.1630394196534
58. in either case they do not	appreciate the private detective's zeal	754.1582800207691
59. perry mason and hamilton	burger nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting	each other than they do in looking for the criminal	2467.694168927922
60. frequently enough	the police are themselves in league with the killer; dashiell	hammett's	red harvest provides a classic example of this theme	3261.4014098776056
61. but even when the police are honest they do not trust the private	eye	951.7500601412514
62. he is like phillip marlowe too alienated to be reliable	563.7949599980309
63. finally	in the maltese falcon among others the clash between detective	and police is carried to its logical conclusion: sam spade	becomes the chief murder suspect	2733.5706879040144
64. in order to exonerate himself he	is compelled to find the real criminal who happens to be his girl friend	2806.3605866075095
65. what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes	now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of	turning into his opposite	3110.7843020813507
66. it is the growing contradiction	between individualism and public service in the mystery story which	creates this fatal dilemma	2584.9324300405588
67. by upholding his own personal code of behavior	the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society	whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption	2878.043360376461
68. that society	responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo	a potential criminal	2369.0440435548767
69. if the detective insists upon retaining his	personal standards he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society	1886.5644744780013
70. he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel	1191.7616969722724
71. on the other hand if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession	he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism	2454.8385527336595
72. dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write	mystery	stories and turning to other pursuits	1873.5890570885433
73. his successors have adopted	the opposite alternative	93.7007948875456
74. in order to save the mystery story they	have converted the private detective into an organization man	2125.2119138445805
75. the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by	mickey spillane's mike hammer	1259.2077196502582
76. at first glance this hero seems	to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors	2796.121122176939
77. for hammer nothing is forbidden	14.917631594459909
78. he kills when he pleases	takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge jury	and executioner rolled into one	3513.024457735172
79. it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in	an organization determine the type of network required because the	type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages	enumerated in table 1	3951.8160993693855
80. great stress is placed on the role that	the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness	of the network	3035.500661647282
81. by monitoring we mean some system of control	over the types of information sent from the various centers	1570.9901888644688
82. as a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no	message is purely one of the four types question command statement	or exclamation	4286.758848585546
83. for example suppose a man wearing a $200 watch driving	a 1959 rolls royce stops to ask a man on the sidewalk what	time is it	2722.43861157008
84. this sentence would have most of the characteristics	of a question but it has some of the characteristics of a statement	because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in	his own timepiece or the one attached to his car	6818.656431236406
85. if the man on the	sidewalk is surprised at this question it has served as an exclamation	1415.4635804904135
86. also since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer	the question	has assumed some measurable properties of a command	3045.294609852427
87. however for	convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified	according to table 1	1565.596072314896
88. on this basis certain extreme kinds of networks	will be discussed for illustrative purposes	1408.0195194702496
89. some special types of organization	presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire	to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted	and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy	for future cooperative endeavors	4453.1545553969445
90. the party is usually in a room	small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another	3046.189257797613
91. the information is furnished by each of the guests is sent by	oral broadcasting over the air waves and is received by the ears	2474.9252767319394
92. since	the air is a continuum the network of communication remains intact	regardless of the positions or motions of the points	in the net	3712.7499263003506
93. as shown in figure 1 there is a connection for communication	between every pair of points	1262.2809987703472
94. this and other qualifications make	the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication	system ever dreamed up	2591.2402383338904
95. all four types of message listed in table	1 are permitted although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding	the commands to a minimum while exclamations having complimentary	intonations are more than customarily encouraged	3559.402220005497
96. the completeness	of the connections provide that for n people there are f	lines of communication between the pairs which can become a large number	for a party of fifty guests	4978.442584711719
97. looking at the diagram we	see that f connection lines come in to each member	1089.0508588314246
98. thus the cocktail	party would appear to be the ideal system but there is one weakness	1879.159321954316
99. in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group the	f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond	comprehension if n exceeds about six	3320.2173430203998
100. the crowd consequently	breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six with	a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes	4304.800369918588
101. for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else	and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers then	the open house system is advantageous because the honored guests	are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections	at the door	4911.656405359432
102. we consider a rural	community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration	is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary	for family subsistence	4660.261589940177
103. we assume for this illustration that the	size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings	is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication	is between nearest neighbors only as shown in figure 2	4476.01263779972
104. information	beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- third- and fourth-hand	as a distortable rumor	1413.1958170987425
105. in figure 2 the points in the network are	designated by a letter accompanied by a number	1417.4343033095927
106. the numbers indicate	the number of nearest neighbors	250.41720120303233
107. it will be noted that point f	has seven nearest neighbors h and e have six and p	has only one while the remaining points have intermediate numbers	2996.0196221969554
108. in any social system in which communications have an importance	comparable with that of production and other human factors a point	like f in figure 2 would be the dwelling	place for the community leader while e and h would	house the next most important citizens	7001.214602112654
109. a point like p gets	information directly from n but all information beyond n	is indirectly relayed through n	1713.3999248080243
110. the dweller at p is	last to hear about a new cure the slowest to announce to his neighbors	his urgent distresses the one who goes the farthest to trade and the	one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or	getting people to join him in a cooperative effort	7812.689557511161
111. since the hazards	of poor communication are so great p can be justified as a habitable	site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made	available by a waterfall for milling purposes a mine or a sugar maple	camp	4420.571386423014
112. location theorists have given these matters much consideration	251.3565232928982
113. the networks for military communications	are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be	changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the	addition of new machines of war	3937.853215420656
114. they also furnish proof that in	modern war message sending must be monitored	1175.6813552585568
115. without monitoring a	military hookup becomes a noisy party	260.23389224916787
116. the need for monitoring became	greater when radio was adopted for military signaling	1178.8755064711138
117. alexander the	great who used runners as message carriers did not have to worry about	having every officer in his command hear what he said and having	hundreds of them comment at once	3545.473114111011
118. as time has passed and science has	progressed the speed of military vehicles has increased the range of	missiles has been extended the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles	has been adopted and the range and breadth of message sending	has increased	6694.41218115801
119. next to the old problem of the slowness of decision	making network structure seems to be paramount and without monitoring	no network has value	2452.7829757864683
120. on the parade ground the net may be similar	to that shown in figure 3	1638.134524943211
121. the monitoring is the highest and	most restrictive of any organization in existence	782.6959134455312
122. no questions statements	or explanations are permitted- only commands	397.0563002464661
123. commands go only	from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank	792.7457962446044
124. the same command	is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to	corporal	2377.1396547826603
125. all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and	terminate with action of the men in the ranks	1734.878487569665
126. even the officer in charge	be it a captain or a general is restrained	by monitoring	1893.596421405482
127. this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the	hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility	2024.966955779701
128. the commands are specified by the military regulations; are	few in number briefly worded all different in sound; and are combinable	into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be	desired on a parade ground	5767.029482699645
129. this monitoring is necessary because on	a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitoring	a confused social event would develop	2330.3938051654945
130. with troops dispersed	on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that	a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines	of communication	4817.389625099721
131. years ago this was true but with the replacement	of wires or runners by radio and radar these	restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard	2994.541658906461
132. in contrast to cocktail parties military organizations even	in the field are more formal	1428.2547004464097
133. in the extreme and oversimplified example	suggested in figure 3 the organization is more easily understood	and more predictable in behavior	2033.9985595323603
134. a military organization has an objective	chosen by the higher command	756.8163813330362
135. this objective is adhered to throughout	the duration of the action	504.85650823147927
136. the connective system or network	is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective and it is therefore	not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated	unit has a different communication network than a factory a college	or a rural village	6855.29738043579
137. the assumptions upon which the example	shown	in figure 3 is based are: one man can direct about six subordinates	if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not	need too much personal coaching indoctrinating etc	4051.5677888739165
138. a message	runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more	than about six consecutive times	3264.789582870988
139. decisions of a general kind	are made by the central command	503.49138183803234
140. and all action of a physical kind	pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower	rank	3271.58533236703
141. these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the	top six directly under him six under each of these and so on until	there are six levels of personnel	3333.0366005516653
142. the number of people acting as one	body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of f 55987	men	2813.1372947879
143. this organizational network would be of no avail if there	were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent	1878.5814271224892
144. of types	of message listed in table 1 commands and statements are the only	ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3	3700.259235823474
145. a further	regulation is that commands always go down unaccompanied by statements	and statements always go up unaccompanied by commands	1899.9587571642119
146. questions	and particularly exclamations are usually channeled along informal	horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried	beyond the nearest neighbor	3680.7053217783564
147. it will readily be seen that	in this suggested network	greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than	is usually put into practice	2174.72888896237
148. furthermore the network in figure	3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics	and the like are interlaced	3495.8038957728045
149. not discussed here are some	military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare where the	surveillance sending transmitting and receiving are all so inadequate	that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks	3662.657665910077
150. such	problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much	like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall	grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they	could teach	6444.476297580752
151. this is an unsolved	problem which probably has never been seriously investigated although	one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists	of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss for example	in precision machinery and mathematics or the finns in geochemistry	4683.876393105873
152. we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have	not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine	our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes	4834.598009088602
153. this problem	of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and	specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis	2173.700624607919
154. since	the difficulty of drawing the net is great we will merely discuss	it	1415.8313668335509
155. first we realize that a pure specialist does not exist	374.6799225756334
156. but	for practical purposes we have people who can be considered as such	1178.806176376307
157. for example there are persons who are in physical science in the	field of mineralogy trained in crystallography who use only x-rays	applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction to clay	minerals only and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating	on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the	field of anthropology studying the lung capacity of seven andean	indians	5759.19361969943
158. so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more	about less and less as he develops as contrasted to the generalist	who knows less and less about more and more	5651.662303599811
159. american democratic thought pointed up the relation between the	protestant movement in this country and the development of a social	religion which he called the american democratic faith	2980.655214778274
160. those familiar	with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the	democratic faith at around 1850	2590.0575961646427
161. and he describes it as a balanced polarity	between the notions of the free individual and what he called	the fundamental law	2178.3674676211263
162. i want to say more about gabriel's so-called	fundamental law	564.0736849313585
163. but first i want to quote him on the relationship	that he found between religion and politics in this country and	what happened to it	2581.128385770806
164. he points out that from the time of jackson on	through world war 1 evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence	in the social and political life of america	4471.363518968852
165. he terms this	early enthusiasm romantic christianity and concludes that its	similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine	of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical	protestantism	3936.766135212194
166. let me quote him even more fully for his	analysis is important to my theme	1646.0590779639158
167. he says: beside the	protestant philosophy of progress as expressed in radical or conservative	millenarianism should be placed the doctrine of the democratic	faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united	states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted	the beacon of democracy	5192.958053940647
168. he specifies in the middle period	of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism	in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism	3884.0798013490376
169. but in	every period it has been humanism	167.0279150708308
170. and let me add utopianism also	65.4994044250023
171. some fourteen or fifteen years ago in an essay i called	the leader follows- where	1104.44840255248
172. i used his polarity to illustrate	what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call	progressivism	3026.5612072561853
173. it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the	balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law	in the common man	2458.442454761682
174. that is to say gabriel's fundamental law had been	so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor	law any more	3665.99896787991
175. it is a weakness of gabriel's analysis that he never	seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been	cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy	3420.2141244921477
176. and	with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel	called christian supernaturalism	1401.9932315298415
177. and the common man was developing	mythic power or charisma on his own	789.0902256716274
178. during the decade	that followed the common man as that piece put it grew uncomfortable	as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow	only to learn from science to his shocked relief that after all there	was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow-	that there was a chemical formula for him and that too much couldn't	be expected of him	0.30166232349522504
179. the socialism implicit in the slogan	of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seems a	far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution	or of the jacksonian frontier	3664.0304118054496
180. what had happened to the common	man	139.46534667606238
181. french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence	in this country before the days of popularism	1102.6690347969636
182. the riotous onrush	of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general	secular drift to the religion of humanity however prepared	the way for a reception of the french revolution's socialistic offspring	of one sort of another	6200.361612362167
183. the first of which to find important place	in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson	1727.5595766003746
184. moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s the	dislocations of the depression the common ethos of materialism everywhere	all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced	mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy	of the little people	6794.998977898897
185. however it is important to trace the	philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the	common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence	of the latter on the former	3664.635524047586
186. that john locke's philosophy of	the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration	of independence i believe we generally accept	3272.741278210148
187. yet after	rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion	of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became	the idea source of the french revolution also	3673.6586097195163
188. the importance	of rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us however	1173.6548094019042
189. this	notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in	the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship	2184.6791582837177
190. and it	is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle in his remarkable long	essay the heresy of democracy and in a more general way by	voegelin in his new science of politics that this same rousseauan	idea descending through european democracy is the source of	marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat	7750.7782227153275
191. this is important	to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves	in after world war 2 and our great democratic victory	that brought no peace	2727.672234449434
192. the long road that had taken liberals in	this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of	man led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under	a socialist state	5637.975263270049
193. and the ussr existed as the revolutionary	experiment in radical socialism the ultimate exemplar	945.3322589743445
194. and by the	time the war ended liberal leadership in this country was spiritually	marxist	1637.1069585077462
195. we will recall that the still confident liberals of	the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in	san francisco to set up the legal framework finally and at last to	rationalize war- to rationalize want and fear- out of the world:	the united nations	4596.411264459993
196. we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace	and rehabilitation	967.3283183428923
197. then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle	of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral	war with our strongest ally	2456.966980108922
198. during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly	backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal	3269.289801984285
199. during	the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in	the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative	policy of containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced and enforceable	only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste	for but could not abandon: the atom bomb	5147.53485649832
200. in 1952 it will be remembered	the gop without positive program campaigned on the	popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly	3275.255899101642
201. all of this i know is recent history familiar to you	504.00248481774895
202. but	i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common	man to point up what happened to him under eisenhower's leadership	4272.959054944794
203. a perceptive journalist sam lubell has phrased it in the	title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates	2171.4380196164416
204. he opens	his discourse however with a review of the eisenhower inaugural	festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents	all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age	5469.374105898032
205. the	show was colorful indeed exuberant but the press for all its assiduity	could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny	2321.6869418126807
206. lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue	1183.2335863323005
207. and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation: in essence	the drama of his presidency can be described	as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling- thus far	with but limited and precarious success- to give effective voice	and force to that conservatism	4707.413872487322
208. i will assume that we are	all aware of the continuing struggle with its limited and precarious	success toward conservatism	2829.3681006029537
209. it has moved on various levels it has	been clamorous and confused	645.8990840035599
210. obviously there has been no agreement on	what american conservatism is or rather what it should be	2115.9597836159182
211. for it	was neglected not to say nascent when the struggle began	641.4077382350262
212. i saw a	piece the other day assailing william buckley author of man and	god at yale and publisher of the national review as no conservative	at all but an old liberal	5194.682070550357
213. i would agree with this view	43.50889223987606
214. but	i'm not here to define conservatism	141.24413769054098
215. what i am here to do	is to report on the gyrations of the struggle- a struggle that amounts	to self-redefinition- to see if we can predict its future course	3224.5200465660005
216. one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of	the last election i suppose is that we the majority were dissatisfied	with eisenhower conservatism	4265.124499754785
217. though to be sure we gave kennedy	no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment	1416.215711956155
218. this is however symptomatic of our national malaise	249.78929906212596
219. but before i	try to diagnose it i would offer other evidence	637.3924588641827
220. i will mention two	volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year	1634.5796274084048
221. the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise sponsored by life	magazine under the title of the national purpose	1724.2077585367995
222. the contributors	to this testament were all well-known: a former democratic	candidate for president a new deal poet the magazine's chief	editorial writer two newspaper columnists head of a national broadcasting	company a popular protestant evangelist etc	5939.828724536399
223. what i want	to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals or modified liberals	with perhaps one exception	2016.5546103427332
224. i suppose we might classify billy	graham as an old liberal	760.5844421208039
225. and i would further note that they all-	with one exception again- sang in one key or another the same song	2034.0556083456656
226. its refrain was: let us return to the individualistic democracy	of our forefathers for our salvation	1877.2718137272836
227. adlai stevenson	expressed some reservations about this return	166.64209892974367
228. others invoked technology	and common sense	65.29119172671076
229. only walter lippman envisioned the possibility	of our having outlived most of what we used to regard as the program	of our national purposes	2456.2978886760275
230. but the most notable thing about	the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth	of socialism was conspicuously absent	3044.8629317924365
231. the second specific	comment was the report of eisenhower's commission on national	goals titled goals for americans	1413.2611102512312
232. they perhaps gave the pitch	of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower	requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly	of columbia university because it was non-partisan	5443.641827492839
233. the	commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the	unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to invoke the now	taboo symbolism of socialism	2857.935330636601
234. and here again we hear the same refrain	mentioned above: the paramount goal of the united states	h set long ago h was to guard the rights of the individual h ensure	his development h enlarge his opportunity	6073.525127931846
235. this group is secularist	and their program tends to be technological	503.9209609874862
236. but it is	the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as	symptom of the common man's malaise	3052.075562740944
237. and let me add murray's new	book as another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention	time magazine gave it when it came out recently	2970.5304814740202
238. father murray	goes back to the declaration of independence too though i may	add with considerably more historical perception	2600.8684644224795
239. i will reserve	discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy	1092.083618971493
240. as symptomatic of the common man's malaise he is most significant:	a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth	3488.4713941922555
241. does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confused	state of the public mind	1741.4425173805714
242. what is the common man's	complaint	65.15359156917143
243. let's take a panoramic look back over the course we	have come	647.1335413536367
244. has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism	up until the turning back under eisenhower	2588.7125451705774
245. and the basic character	of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic	788.9690147813146
246. ralph	gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress	751.5334578262668
247. but	there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook	259.9146010019006
248. does our society have a runaway uncontrollable growth of	technology which may end our civilization or a normal healthy growth	2816.056650395628
249. here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers	by their rapidly accelerating growth determinable only when related	to the more normal rate of healthy growth	3109.2803533392585
250. should the accelerating	growth of technology then warn us	387.40600706218675
251. noting such evidence is the first	step; and almost the only cure is early detection and removal	1430.475882618332
252. one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology	would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their	functioning is as healthy as before	5021.316531804305
253. so an objective look at our	present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous	situation	1559.2338952561604
254. in any event whether society may have cancer or merely	a virus infection the disease we shall find is political	economical social and even medical	3902.3403199725435
255. have not our physical abilities	already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now	living	1421.576232781114
256. hence the prime issue as i see it is whether a democratic	or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind	or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible	with its own needs as a force of nature	6724.469632640724
257. we are already committed	to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere	on earth not merely in the limited social-political-economical context	we are fond of today	2739.635722906663
258. otherwise we go on endlessly trying to draw	the line color and other as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate	3673.980402439239
259. we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to	contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is	to be extremely shortsighted if nothing else	3210.666989525604
260. we must believe we have	the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything	1884.9209301740873
261. so in these pages the term technology is used to include any	and all means which could amplify project or augment man's control	over himself and over other men	3111.495566081634
262. naturally this includes all communication	forms eg languages or any social political economic	or religious structures employed for such control	2798.1992011863445
263. properly mindful	of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world we must	employ these resources without war or violent revolution	2180.2083996976917
264. if	we were creating a wholly new society we could insist that our social	political economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than	hamper man; best growth	4084.6135910856474
265. but we cannot start off with a clean slate	264.21310741948804
266. so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to	the effect of each on man's major needs	2576.361239810047
267. asked which institution	most needs correction i would say the corporation as it exists in america	today	1421.098941371554
268. at first glance this appears strange: of all people	was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new	way of life still inspiring undeveloped societies abroad	4426.989209820888
269. but	hear harrison e salisbury former moscow correspondent of the	new york times and author of to moscow- and beyond	1873.4491787799955
270. in a book review of the soviet cultural offensive he says	long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into	an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive	within soviet borders the sharp cutting-edge of american	culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes as when the enterprising	promoters of 'porgy and bess' overrode the state department	to carry the contemporary 'cultural warfare' behind the	enemy lines	0.30166232349522504
271. they were not diplomats or jazz musicians or even organizers	of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays but rugged capitalist	entrepreneurs like henry ford hugh cooper thomas campbell	the international harvester co and david w griffith	3678.8741679231484
272. their	kind created an american culture superior to any in the world an	industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did	almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal	treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or	program a series of consultations of interested agencies	7709.661746251055
273. this favorable	image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still	there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda h	perhaps the public's present attitude	toward business stems from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur	no more exists in america	4566.152511605728
274. in his stead is a milquetoast	version known as the corporation	762.9001223853526
275. but even if we cannot see	the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america foreigners	can; and our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result	2863.230916529954
276. no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts	563.7491033637205
277. if we want respect	from ourselves or others we will have to earn it	942.7040028089466
278. first let us	realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times now	the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership	3257.470112750037
279. businesses	must develop as a result of the ideas energies and ambitions of an	individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind	2341.7258453278446
280. when we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure	by means of taxes and other legal statutes we adopted what i would	term pseudo-capitalism and so took a major step toward socialism	5173.418697728883
281. the biggest loss of course was the individual's lessened desire	and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and	our economy	2597.9925402579847
282. socialism i grant has a definite place in our society	565.3109145586609
283. but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to	a form that is not truly capitalistic	1880.0371124702917
284. some forms of capitalism do indeed	work- superb organizations a credit to any society	1413.6515837953477
285. but the pseudo-capitalism	which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics	and social life will not stand close scrutiny	2034.8959844412875
286. its pretense to operate	in the public interest is little more than a sham	1426.1478989562195
287. it serves	only its own stockholders and poorly at that	373.2591910080718
288. as a creative enterprise	its abilities are primarily in swallowing creative enterprises	developed outside its own organization		1296.5001687170438
289. as to benefits to employees it is notorious	for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services	1876.1604502615378
290. the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism	vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged	within governmental bureaucracy	4116.370626996651
291. but while the corporation has all	the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization	it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its	unluckily it	does not have the desirable aspect of socialism the motivation to operate	for the benefit of society as a whole	4756.627733477243
292. so we are faced with a	vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever	manner they can without regard to the needs of society controlling	society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's	needs for survival	6287.172614840122
293. the corporation has a limited specific	place in our society	376.6453983614773
294. ideally speaking it should be allowed to operate	only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply	or services and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary	to the needs of society	6112.126791608995
295. examples are in public utilities making	military aircraft and accessories or where the investment and risk	for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible	to achieve by any means other than the corporate form eg	constructing major airports or dams	4637.677388333899
296. thus if corporations are not	to run away with us they must become quasi-governmental institutions	subject to public control and needs	3025.4504472900976
297. in all other areas private initiative	of the proprietorship type should be urged to produce the	desired goods and services	1886.5080182811657
298. avoiding runaway	technology can be done only by assuring a humane society; and for this	human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our	society rests	4825.687570623032
299. such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can	offer corporations cannot	375.9829527162827
300. it can project long-range goals for itself	140.4881338190549
301. corporations react violently to short-range stimuli e g	quarterly and annual dividend reports	786.0096277050515
302. proprietorships can establish	a unity and integrity of control; corporations being more amorphous	cannot	1407.1407454281475
303. proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity representing	a human personality and thus establish sincere relationships with	customers and community	1727.7218006032167
304. corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal	inhumane shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated	a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public	3877.080686473939
305. the	proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate	structure with its board of directors and stockholders	1883.7444447542232
306. leadership is	lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop	1409.3982527722546
307. men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences	of the most varied complicated and trying type so that at maturation	they have developed the competence and willingness to accept	the personal responsibility so sorely needed now	4134.9599582936735
308. hence government	must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their	activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest	3024.5089681991226
309. proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations	e g the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth	2030.0273136123822
310. corporations should pay added taxes to be used for educational purposes		391.638039393132
311. the right to leave legacies	should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated	639.0350657706952
312. to perpetuate	wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no	role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to	the fore and is basically anti-democratic	4988.8014926984515
313. when the proprietor dies	the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired	by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it	2599.5541627328594
314. strikes	should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements	would have to be settled by government representatives acting as	controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would	now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors	must be completely interdependent as they are each a part of the	whole	7531.868545432383
315. strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship if internally	motivated prevent a healthy relationship	942.9635144289862
316. certainly external	forces	should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to	do so	1876.3496484861976
317. if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system how can	we expect to abolish it internationally	1566.0185450150093
318. these proposals would go far toward creating the economic	atmosphere favoring growth of the individual who in turn would help	us to cope with runaway technology	4088.895868373403
319. individual human strength is	needed to pit against an inhuman condition	504.63109482197416
320. the battle is not easy	22.297402435470467
321. we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them	straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible	of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed	enlightened competent leaders	4293.276112301983
322. persons developed in to-day's corporations	cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences	of my own in business and in activities outside	3685.377908095574
323. in my own company in	effect a partnership although legally a corporation i have been able	to do many things for my employees which normal corporations	of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do	3952.4979857503713
324. also i	am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of	a partnership i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems	for myself and my fellow-employees	5002.795428876156
325. any abilities i may have were	achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the	growth and control of my business coupled with raising my family	2973.433486828559
326. this	combined experience on a foundation of very average i assure you	intelligence and background has helped me do things many well-informed	people would bet heavily against	4305.1878332928645
327. perhaps a list of some of the practices	of my company will help here	938.4181498816431
328. the company grew	out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties	neither having a formal education applicable to or experience in	manufacturing or selling our type of articles	5167.351066193847
329. from an initial investment	of $1200 in 1943 it has grown with no additional capital investment	to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10000000		1917.3135902890524
330. its growth	continues steadily on a par with past growth; and no limitation is	in evidence	1878.6267853295035
331. our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance	in just a few years time despite substantial well established competition	1733.0782473362335
332. during the last years of woodrow wilson's administration	a red scare developed in our country	1654.7088747102775
333. many americans reacted irrationally	to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of	ideas by force	1568.959276358703
334. postmaster general burleson set about to protect the	american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through	the mails	2827.911552078976
335. attorney general palmer made a series of raids that	sent more than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails in direct violation	of their constitutional rights	2589.7740754361216
336. then not many years later the	un-american activities committee under the leadership of martin	dies pilloried hundreds of decent patriotic citizens	3036.5900528736197
337. anyone who	tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy	was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction	of our government	3341.244409963355
338. this hysteria reached its height under the	leadership of senator joseph mccarthy	958.9345949468577
339. demagogues of this sort found	communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter	to stereotyped notions	1714.8279722589432
340. new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed	no matter how	749.1458623357602
341. those who would suppress dangerous thoughts	credit ideas with high potency	506.5413924853563
342. they give strict interpretation to	william james' statement that every idea that enters the mind	tends to express itself	2588.437508272371
343. they seem to believe that a person will	act automatically as soon as he contacts something new	1420.297099850594
344. hence the only	defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion unless it	gives evidence that it is perfectly safe	3021.971391250972
345. despite this danger	however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are	our finest tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded	on a ledger page; they are the most valuable of commodities-	and the most salable for their demand far exceeds supply	4818.993453297186
346. so all-important	are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and	happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent	new ideas of their own and those who borrow beg or steal from others	6194.673613375841
347. seemingly with an unrestricted flow of ideas all will	be well and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff	away	2735.649339296029
348. that however may also bring the police if the thinking	does not meet with social approval	1898.334557778428
349. criminals as well as model	citizens exercise their minds	263.6334296000326
350. merely having a mental image of some	sort is not the all-important consideration	1184.960798412328
351. of course there	must be clarity: a single distinct impression is more valuable than	many fuzzy ones	1420.3167536210533
352. but clarity is not enough	22.033970366635078
353. the writer took a class	of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st	joseph missouri	1885.4317397556565
354. an inmate a former university professor expounded	to us logically and clearly that someone was pilfering his thoughts	2359.2084762251275
355. he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities	that justice might be done	1720.207550141188
356. despite the clarity of his presentation	his idea was not of einsteinian calibre	1167.9225046031588
357. true ideas	are important perhaps life's most precious treasures	260.88887243317004
358. but have we	not gone overboard in stressing their significance	559.7107451017902
359. have we not actually	developed idea worship	93.52585354733264
360. ideas we must have and we seek	them everywhere	389.9619777446207
361. we scour literature for them; here we find stored	the wisdom of great minds	943.4874080994159
362. but are all these works worthy of consideration	250.9927731803851
363. can they stand rigid scrutiny	14.759770187516107
364. shakespeare's	wit and wisdom his profound insight into human nature have stood the	test of centuries	1886.231979090282
365. but was he infallible in all things	92.99854194093689
366. what of	his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice	958.574157667154
367. shakespeare	gives us a vivid picture of shylock but probably he never saw a	jew unless in some of his travels	2034.176254031882
368. the jews had been banished from	england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 when	shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years	3879.70269773527
369. if any had escaped	expulsion by hiding they certainly would not frequent the market-place	938.345510449895
370. shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays	but borrowed them from old stories ballads and plays wove them	together and then breathed into them his spark of life	5000.356362514373
371. rather than	from a first-hand study of jewish people his delineation of shylock	stems from a collection of italian stories il pecorone published	in 1558	although written almost two centuries earlier	3326.9445671900553
372. he could	learn at second hand from books but could not thus capture the real	jewish spirit	2123.8308762278166
373. harris j griston in shaking the dust from	shakespeare writes: there is not a word spoken by shylock	which one would expect from a real jew	2750.304565401821
374. he took the	story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone	1883.724288243413
375. the jew	was the safest victim	43.678493839482044
376. no jew was on hand to boycott his financially	struggling theater	753.4066193244169
377. it would have been unwise policy for instance	to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman	1411.9235578447056
378. just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars or even	of tikopia and no senatorial investigation will result	3285.3924108454084
379. who cares	about them!   shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an	aberrant individual	1092.3881210892243
380. he sets him forth as being typical of the group	565.2703454869243
381. he tells of his jewish heart- not a shylockian heart;	but a jewish heart	935.85545053596
382. this would make anyone crafty and cruel capable	of fiendish revenge	750.1430376483222
383. there is no justification for such misrepresentation	93.25821409791432
384. if living jews were unavailable for study the bible	was at hand	957.0155343402594
385. reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist	that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews	1877.1856224420633
386. are we better off for having shakespeare's idea of shylock	556.7460986028442
387. studying the merchant of venice in high school and college	has given many young people their notions about jews	1737.1681543341758
388. does this help	the non-jew to understand this group	392.212410696197
389. thomas de torquemada	inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition put many persons	to death	791.9338335940931
390. his name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty	140.9678287913977
391. would	we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's roman	catholics by saying he had a catholic heart	1877.5023839783375
392. let his bones and	his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is	out of place in our times	3262.038133790682
393. shakespeare's shylock too is of dubious	value in the modern world	503.3132683045711
394. ideas in and of themselves are	not necessarily the greatest good	752.727883367404
395. a successful businessman recently	prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all	economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where	they and their theories might rot together	3756.7909061800865
396. will his words come	to be treasured and quoted through the years	964.8008353178768
397. frequently we	are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted	and in the end only the good ones will survive	2465.3115574141225
398. but is that not	like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids	and powders from an array of bottles and then after stirring expecting	a new wonder drug inevitably to result	5497.262731815991
399. what of the efficiency	of this natural instrument of free discussion	501.2605170729438
400. is there some	magic in it that assures results	391.2608752175705
401. when peter b kyne	informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive	dislike for the japanese did the heated debates of the californians	settle the truth or falsity of the proposition	3458.6723758281355
402. the	leopard's spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902	and in this he announced an unchangeable law	2826.9428337065056
403. if a child had	a single drop of negro blood he would revert to the ancestral line which	except as slaves under a superior race had not made one step of	progress in 3000 years	3774.2954088497077
404. that doctrine has been accepted by many but	has it produced good results	1179.7306018369081
405. in the same vein a certain	short-story plot has been overworked	505.49774404591443
406. the son and heir of a prominent	family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of	her finger nails	3263.746729269856
407. in time she presents her aristocratic husband with	a coal-black child	499.2201926753517
408. is the world better for having this idea thrust upon	it	745.3547129154406
409. will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity	262.81312809740234
410. for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists	the biologists the historians the psychologists and the sociologists	2834.6738716212976
411. long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap	heap	947.9428913558828
412. false ideas surfeit another sector of our life	248.68779015177097
413. for	several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship	504.9917416916398
414. the stepmother almost without exception has been presented	as a cruel ogress	962.7697078014687
415. children conditioned by this mistaken notion	have feared stepmothers while adults by their antagonistic attitudes	have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one	2723.7686874068486
416. debate	is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild	a happier one	2364.5362246694785
417. research on the other hand has shown many stepmothers	to be eminently successful some far better than the real mothers	1881.200619484495
418. helen deutsch informed us	that in all cultures the term 'stepmother'	automatically evokes deprecatory implications a conclusion accepted	by many	2811.588679979027
419. will mere debate on that proposition even though it be	free and untrammeled remove the dross and leave a residue of refined	gold	2322.210089473658
420. that is questionable to say the least	140.78947281116874
421. research into several	cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one	790.8641929948884
422. most	assuredly ideas are invaluable	22.23852096074889
423. but ideas just for the sake of having	them are not enough	637.966934338757
424. in the 1930's cures for the depression literally	flooded washington	560.0564288353394
425. for a time the president received hundreds	of them every day most of them worthless	1097.371406988492
426. ideas need to be	tested and not merely by argument and debate	964.271758787165
427. when some question arises	in the medical field concerning cancer for instance we do not	turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign	2742.784424964783
428. we have	recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory	560.2240546778933
429. the	merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the	forensic platform or in newspaper editorials but in the laboratory	and by tests in the field on thousands of children	3447.1968703274133
430. our presidential	campaigns provide much debate and argument	252.20725484139493
431. but is the result	new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence	solve our domestic and international problems	2454.388233534206
432. man we are	told is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from	bad	1882.9938666223502
433. but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value	from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely particularly since	such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes in themselves	declarations of intellectual bankruptcy	3842.282004598742
434. we are reminded however	that freedom of thought and discussion the unfettered exchange	of ideas is basic under our form of government	3266.1536779690805
435. assuredly in	our political campaigns there is freedom to think to examine any and	all issues and to speak without restraint	2015.591059747654
436. but	have the results been heartening	65.19303240462878
437. may we state with confidence that	in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security	1413.4373030728034
438. we must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate	have produced beneficial results	1886.2880276497303
439. in truth we can say that this broke	the power of senator joseph mccarthy who was finally exposed	in full light to the american people	2582.197896637643
440. if he had been liquidated	in some way he would have become a martyr a rallying point for people	who shared his ideas	3479.9969437995896
441. debate in the political arena can be productive	of good	372.97583058771033
442. but it is a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce	negative results but not much that is positive	2589.2783026212373
443. debate rid us of	mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive	934.2199406779021
444. it did something	to clear the ground but it erected no striking new structure; it	did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new	3887.895138497758
445. in the field of the natural sciences scientifically verified data are	quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good	results	2320.6522777807995
446. in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of	tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage	3472.1599816472326
447. by no means would we discourage the production of ideas:	they provide raw materials with which to work; they provide stimulations	that lead to further production	2740.4695961788757
448. we would establish no censorship	22.226251423858294
449. the president's personality would have opened that office to him	374.2564447425615
450. and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the	land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make	it a successorship by inheritance	5181.252287392317
451. it is testimony to the deep respect	in which mr eisenhower was held by members of all parties that	the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were	not explicitly to be broached	3734.02722476671
452. these began to be apparent in a	press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting	specialists might clarify the president's condition for the	nation	4476.3734746158825
453. and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate	the ethics of the medical profession his article in the atlantic	monthly accomplished a good deal more	2731.364118034584
454. it forced us to fix the responsibility	for the position in which all medical commentators had been	placed	2350.1524496504576
455. the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded	us that in the historical perspective the president's decision will	finally clarify itself as a moral rather than a medical problem	2989.69959253336
456. because	the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president	rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us	the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems	under political pressure	5771.448639832444
457. for the president had dealt with the	matter humbly in what he conceived as the democratic way	1423.9454774739645
458. but the	problem is one which gives us the measure of a man rather than a group	of men whether a group of doctors a group of party members assembled	at a dinner to give their opinion or the masses of the voters	6694.91704744273
459. any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in	the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive	it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the	chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and	president in a situation which should never have arisen	5415.016586984355
460. it was a	response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition	which resulted in attempts at prediction	2810.3042503685483
461. in no other situation	would a group of doctors struggling competently to improve the life	expectancy of a man beloved by the world be subjected to such merciless	and persistent questioning and before they were prepared to demonstrate	the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind	the problems it faces	5135.661574438833
462. and though we can look back now and see their	errors we can look back also to the ultimate error	2843.582193925784
463. it recurred	in the press conferences: the president's remarks about his running	developed a singular tone one which we find in few statements	made by public individuals on such a matter	3355.2993950212576
464. the press conference became	a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than	his convictions	2354.4753379947365
465. he commented- thoughtfully a reporter told us-	that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up	1864.3878807275591
466. he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst	period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any	renewed question about his running: as in the battle of the bulge	he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers	7622.684969303407
467. yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such	a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed	with battles to be fought regardless of the consequences	3558.4202941743924
468. in this	case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears	1418.73132594764
469. the	presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications	of the death of any incumbent	1250.054325853489
470. it is of the utmost importance to the	people of america and of the world how their governing president ends	up during the four years of his term	4461.280260445596
471. only when that term is	ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom	and the courage to discount the dangers of his death	3121.575613857778
472. ironically enough	in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury	750.1871239298629
473. at	the national and international level then what is the highest kind	of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political	immorality	2462.362859105853
474. and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the	moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us	3266.6958790297795
475. for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr eisenhower's	original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting	1718.1465699878718
476. neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive	sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation	betraying its sense that something significant has transpired	was in evidence	5324.521809478871
477. nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than	the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine	the issue which also carried the second announcement of the	candidacy	3328.120462525755
478. the double editorial on two aspects of the u s	spirit was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles	great as well as small reflecting popular approval of this questionable	attitude toward the highest office in the land	6323.649563286068
479. the moral	creed and the will to risk live happily together if we	do not examine where the line is to be drawn	2325.87005656813
480. i may possibly be a	greater risk than is the normal person of my age the president had	said on february 29th of the election year ignoring the fact that	no one of his age had ever lived out another term	6451.993570777954
481. my doctors assure	me that this increased percentage of risk is not great	783.0125141536929
482. but by	the time the risk was doubled events had dismissed from his mind both	increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering	carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza	5355.874627021254
483. only infrequently	did the situation color his thinking	166.72819050097226
484. ironically no president	we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the	possibility to which his own words in the press conference held at	the beginning of august testified: that unable as he was himself	to say his running was best for the country unconsciously he had placed	his party before his nation	7882.664023840317
485. so it is that we relive his opening	statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy	of the present	2025.74415497651
486. no consideration of risk urges itself upon him	now: for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not	properly focussed	4109.424869321478
487. yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than	some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him he feels what	he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest	he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters	4609.374545424706
488. moving	as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of	him he adopts a position that is morally indefensible	3473.430263533474
489. he ascribes	to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter- the assurance	that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer	than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do-	has brought him	4468.735885334254
490. what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the	laws of human probability whether or not it is later confirmed has	become by september of the election year a firm conviction	5143.634265237067
491. as	a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place the	statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion	which gives rise to such convictions	3339.915201833007
492. but it is also the climax	to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history	2120.9352273925915
493. in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could	not rest with his doctors eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening	of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration	in the years to follow	3830.8381717920192
494. in any other man this reassurance to the electorate	would have caused us a profound moral shock	2112.7578312695923
495. about this man we	had to think twice	166.9873150854212
496. we knew that it was as reassurance the ironic	fruit of a deeply moral nature	1644.4863732234542
497. but the fact remains that even the unconscious	acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected	must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major	decisions and thus for imposing his will on the people	4290.2605245680825
498. and in the	context of drifting personal utterances we have examined there was	occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions	3247.025862688732
499. when the possibility	that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision	seemed	to disconcert his questioners mr eisenhower was known to	make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going	to talk about the matter any more	4437.3732111643785
500. thinking had stopped; it was not	to be resumed	387.0084196940246
501. the portrait that had developed fragmentarily	but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking	is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits when it does not	forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence	4595.4895497244615
502. this does not mean that the decision to run for office should	inevitably have been revoked	1879.7611791485483
503. instead it means that the thinking in	which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the	decision as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative	attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered	might have done	4473.838645675913
504. drifting through a third illness apparently	without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency	other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower revealed the singularly	static quality of his thinking	5325.58934835243
505. despite three warnings no	sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation and	thus his responsibilities from wilson's	1888.6685762640325
506. by contrast the	energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes	upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure	of the man	4658.754781515643
507. only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed	considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention	to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality	in the major decision are effectively to be checked	4294.033353344758
508. in the	incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus	the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to articulate	the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant with what	is sometimes astounding rapidity	6083.43574384361
509. like lincoln he can distinguish	his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable	decision exacts of him	1731.2013844607718
510. like roosevelt he can distinguish an	attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans	from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him	4477.489369423596
511. he chooses to subordinate one to the other sometimes reluctantly	accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed	1580.3411934465266
512. the very	nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the	valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader	4092.6031281715927
513. the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact	and the facility with language which can render them into validity	in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the	moral intuition into moral leadership	4236.034850192516
514. the making of distinctions	like the perception of the great distinctions made is an inordinately	difficult business	2145.2413982704106
515. lincoln's slow progress towards the several	marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such and loosely	interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision	2618.4832884304815
516. but	because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other	by means of the capacities with which words endow it we do not unwisely	examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which	decisions hang	6815.4606237059
517. only recently and perhaps because a television debate	can so effectively dramatize president kennedy's extraordinary	mastery of detail have the abilities on which the capacity for making	distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of	politics	4141.749599963439
518. in his recent evaluation of kennedy's potentialities for	leadership walter lippmann has cited the precision of his mind	his immense command of factual detail and his instinct for	the crucial point as impressive in the extreme; and it is surely	clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the	individual's command of language interacts with the other two	8543.000425656084
519. for this change is not a change from one positive position to another	but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation	2471.185461341147
520. the	liberal-conservative	division we might observe in passing is not of itself	directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle	between ruling groups	4099.734788132495
521. rather it is rooted in a difference of response	to the threat of social disintegration	1091.4502733374784
522. the division is not between	those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change	2318.0399000313273
523. rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways	of thought with regard to man's life in society	1875.9313766606342
524. these ways are	absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for	man's redemption from chaos	1878.0703658973725
525. the civilizational crisis the	third type of change raises the question what are we to do	1256.1958304279847
526. on the most primitive level	22.135705667643883
527. for the answer cannot be derived from any	socially cohesive element in the disrupting community	1092.2759384882172
528. there is no	socially existential answer to the question	390.7259442584965
529. for the truth formerly experienced	by the community no longer has existential status in the community	nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians	2590.3264893562673
530. in this phase of change no idea has social acceptance and so none	has ontological status in the community	2589.484973158723
531. an interregnum ensues in which	not men but ideas compete for existence	638.5561388165694
532. if we examine the	three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure	we find an additional profound difference between the third and the	first two one that accounts for the notable difference between the	responses they evoke	6570.979666201788
533. the first two types of change occur within the	inward and immanent structure of the society	1255.8427385620712
534. the first involves a simple	shift of interests in the society	757.1783357186976
535. the second involves something	deeper but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for	the community not in the truth on which the community rests	2862.321727753792
536. thus in	both types attention is focused on the community itself and its phenomenological	life	1652.5734467921266
537. the third type however wrenches attention from	the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the	ground of being on which the community depends for its existence	3433.9509492983575
538. voegelin	has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable healthy	community	1171.420885204627
539. there the community faced with the need to formulate policy	on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to its problem	in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced	3540.6836492844923
540. this	however cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth	is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard and consequently	cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent	5016.755476077229
541. it has	lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances	938.530609275798
542. relativism	and equality are its characteristic diseases	140.0901065214353
543. precisely at the moment	when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out	from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure	itself	3325.1824476677307
544. for paradigmatic history breaks rather than unfolds	precisely when the movement is from order to disorder and not from	one order to a new order	3908.3737999818695
545. the liberal-conservative split to define	it further derives from a basic difference concerning the existential	status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads	to its identification	3118.391705446958
546. when disruptive change has penetrated	to the third level of social order the process of disruption rapidly	reaches a point of no return	3474.272251237602
547. indeed it is probable that this point	is reached the moment the third level of change begins	1407.3344776616104
548. at that point	we reach the closed historical situation: the situation in	which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante	3899.7344679277703
549. at that	point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously fate	or destiny or providence and feel themselves	caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society	3239.636026437886
550. the reasons	for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of	such a change	1643.1628999473596
551. of all forms of being society or community	has the greatest element of determinability	944.0658039147199
552. its ontological status is	itself most tenuous because apart from individual men who are its matter	tradition the form of society exists only as a shared	perception of truth	4682.374176964584
553. the ontological status of society thus is constituted	by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status of society's	members	1098.7954901730989
554. the content of that psychological status determines	ultimately the content of civilization	962.9572245060741
555. those social civilizational	factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease	to exist	1416.2325117578343
556. civilization itself- tradition- falls out of existence	when the human spirit itself becomes confused	1404.193012286998
557. civilization is what	man has made of himself	166.61065118981787
558. its massive contours are rooted in the simple	need of man since he is always incomplete to complete himself	2579.344521755548
559. it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse	497.8090605151427
560. he needs existential	completion he needs that is to move in the direction of completion	1634.7594771533497
561. and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception	of the truth about himself	1251.207746421787
562. he must consequently exist as a	self-perceived substantive developing agent or he does not exist as	man	2134.479988575091
563. thus it is no mystical intuition but an analyzable conception	to say that man and his tradition can fall out of existence	2167.804863374471
564. this	happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance	in himself of a nature that in maritain's words is perceived as	a locus of intelligible necessities	4645.786208204097
565. an existentialist is a man	who perceives himself only as esse as existence without substance	1095.820135774932
566. thus human perception and human volition is the immanent	cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches	the civilizational level	3888.1562401516885
567. thus with regard to the loss of tradition	in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works	itself out as a disruption of the individual soul a change in which man	continues as an objective ontological existent but no longer as a	man	4689.621240323232
568. further change is a form of motion it occurs as the act	of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached	the terminus of the change	5331.513607095062
569. with regard to the change we are examining	the question is at what point does the change become irreversible	1724.4097957831327
570. a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in	the process	957.3805021048305
571. change involves the displacement of form	43.70440485417869
572. this means that	the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive	to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring	the existent form in being	4828.1574007326435
573. if the existent form is to be retained new	factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation	1725.9234003957044
574. in	the case of social decay form is displaced simply by the process of	dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process	3689.7677335419407
575. now in the	mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence	of the ontological weakness of the fading form	2315.9239020436053
576. and when we consider	the tenuous hold tradition has on existence any weakening of that	hold constitutes a crisis of existence	3051.5047863461564
577. the retention of a tradition	confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new	spiritual forces into the situation	1890.585580732812
578. however the crisis occurs precisely	as a weakening of spiritual forces	753.665640778429
579. it would seem therefore that	in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself	787.0516342775413
580. the emergence	of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory	of disorder	2133.5769816818834
581. and it would seem that history is a witness to this	truth	640.2884012057318
582. as a further characterization of the liberal conservative	split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for	escaping inevitabilities in history	3667.5449449651096
583. these differences in turn derive	from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character	of change	1256.7342480433244
584. anxiety and deep insecurity	are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition	1419.9708859882762
585. to experience them it is not necessary for a people to be actively	aware of what is happening to it	1870.8942046712727
586. the process of erosion need only	undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding	within the individual while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation	of processes occurs	4827.387810104777
587. within the individual the reaction has been	called various names all however pointing to the same basic experience	1569.3526547026722
588. weil identifies it as being rootless guardini as being	placeless riesman as being lonely	1430.5305347602502
589. others call it alienation	and mean by that no simple economic experience	but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation	1728.8089299061835
590. within institutions	there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution	of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one	of persuasion	4308.195285567063
591. we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon the manipulation	of the masses by propaganda the mobilization of effort and	resources	2185.8036363275874
592. within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed	responses to the experience of civilizational crisis two basic organizations	of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism	3904.8446209617714
593. these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent	in the crisis	640.0634489817587
594. both are predictably destined to fail	65.05752903599154
595. the	response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing	791.0959096982245
596. its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through	the repression of disruptive forces	1883.8464899358594
597. to this end political authority	is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers	1097.5503263460491
598. the implicit	assumption of this response is that history is reversible	745.8912762971898
599. seemingly	order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by	adventitious accretions	1097.8453507204306
600. the problem is to remove the accretions and	thereby uncover the order that was always there	1869.208710475709
601. such a response of	course misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence	1402.1197696075792
602. moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed	to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of	order once the activation of change has reached visible proportions	5155.497812362513
603. the most reaction can achieve is stasis and a stasis that can be maintained	only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts	itself	2607.4303273249216
604. despite the hopelessness of the response it is explicable	in terms of the crisis of tradition itself	2114.4209602428605
605. since a civilizational	crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling	class reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves	to be among the ruling class	3356.502772959671
606. their great error is to mingle the responses	typical of each of the three types of change	2116.508059312105
607. since civilizational	change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze it seldom is	given adequate attention	1409.754569161522
608. and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted	as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status	1902.1170583558396
609. the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its	realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational	2463.506642924761
610. but this truth is distorted by its extreme application: the assumption	of the separate existence of tradition	2119.670596397842
611. the reactionary misses	the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of	psychological-intellectual	relations	1259.284632783963
612. reactionary theories for this reason	usually assume some form of organismic theory	962.2013735690027
613. in its defensive	formulations the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of	the independent existence of the community	1876.983138230385
614. in its dynamic form it	visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force-	the race for instance which unfolds in history	3486.9277190250637
615. in both cases the	individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality	1256.5539977482235
616. when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual	defense the characteristics of that defense are explicable only	in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction	4475.615683222666
617. reaction is	rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole	504.76942087567966
618. it is a total situation	that is defended: the good old days	957.8226682122158
619. there is no selectivity;	even the questionable features of the past are defended	792.6651259663222
620. the point	is that the reactionary for whatever motive perceives himself to	have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself	something which consequently he was not able to accept or reject	on the basis of subjective preference	6427.001254555382
621. the reactionary is confused about	the existential status of a decaying tradition but he does perceive	the unity tradition had when it was healthy	2475.996814285677
622. all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic	insight in a literary work	2121.9089731626573
623. is the oedipus complex the clinical	syndrome material for a tragedy	502.14445723697156
624. if we remove ourselves for a moment	from our time and our infatuation with mental disease isn't there	something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile	neurosis	5329.844957355907
625. i am not making a clinical judgment here for such	personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's	consulting room but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies	than tragedy in life	3780.2029859128706
626. a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood	and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat	his earliest failure in love only makes us a little weary of man;	his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial	6326.167889930412
627. now we can argue that	the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible	unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward but this	externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between	a story and a clinical case history	4306.66432740368
628. we can also argue that the	three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives	of an internal conflict within one man dostoevsky a conflict	having to	do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman	6090.833083067157
629. but	a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within	his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic	quarterly	2178.4359846601374
630. it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of	oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex	2600.2050255891986
631. whatever	the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who is drawn	to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of	humanity and its archaic crime and the incest that is unknowing renews	the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the	secret	5036.853354669121
632. but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose	his own childhood is only pathetic and for renouncing the mystery	in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies	5659.219542195029
633. i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus	complex is a blind alley for a storyteller	1585.471719948618
634. the best gifts of the novelist	will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises	the novelist may have in store for him	4081.406183269726
635. incest is still a durable	theme but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways	to surprise the emotions and there is no better way to do this than	that of concealment and symbolic representation	4194.485551213671
636. and the best way to	conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out	to write an incest story	3664.6422368255
637. which brings to mind another lawrence story	and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal	theme	1578.9505134828291
638. the rocking horse winner is also a story about	a boy's love for his mother	1662.670456231114
639. if i now risk some comparisons with	sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two	works or judging their merits; i am only singling out differences	in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects	4304.236206424132
640. the rocking horse	winner is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the	reader- but we do not know why	2828.590184846069
641. it is the story of the hopeless love	of a little boy for his cold and vain mother	1566.4036660482413
642. there are ghostly scenes	in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the	climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse	4664.561174218547
643. the	child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make	secret gifts of his money to his mother	2174.5957004241454
644. the story ends in the child's	illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to	ride his horse to win for his mother	3681.8694206780588
645. the child dies with his mourning	mother at his bedside	373.8157623014503
646. i had read the story many times without	asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did	2572.8768916012564
647. but on one	occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was	my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story	2970.790197774113
648. it was of course a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to	himself and replacing the father who could not give her the things she	wanted- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like- but if it were	only this the story would be banal	6924.2553419060905
649. why does the story affect us	43.345035026183744
650. how	does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader	754.7708560551432
651. the	rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that	prophesies the tragedy	1411.9506185766616
652. the rocking i realized is the single element	in the story that carries the erotic message the unspoken and	unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy	and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit	6597.530429822766
653. the	rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent	silent and making it present; it conceals and yet is suggestive;	a perfect symbol	2600.509148211411
654. and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol	we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy	3696.866937267787
655. for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden	love doomed by its nature	1734.6932772528712
656. we are also struck by the fact	that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend while	the incestuous love of the man paul morel sometimes repels	4990.992930775527
657. it's	easy to see why	14.853991900733533
658. this love belongs to childhood; we accord it	its place there and in lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent	fantasy of a child in fact the form in which oedipal love is expressed	in childhood	5774.694222679235
659. and when the child dies in lawrence's story	in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make	his mother rich the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such	a death does not enter into our thoughts at all	4678.935966041096
660. we have so completely	entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the	plausible and the necessary conclusion	3054.492178995754
661. i am sure that none	of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to	describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood	2300.9402228922554
662. it is most probable that	freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing	of this story	2813.8460082694833
663. he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told	and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged	2172.5822347518756
664. he would not	have cared why it emerged he only wanted to capture a memory to play	with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the	story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy	6184.084443127303
665. in	our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis	has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from	this marriage	2861.8234045791232
666. ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring	forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled	2831.119226386311
667. the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge; he	has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological	insights	2592.4305032472566
668. he borrows the insights of psychology to improve	his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision	that should be a novelist's own	4091.852709761416
669. he has been seduced by the marvels	of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces	of character	1885.7516512941536
670. if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear	to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is	because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that	we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior that the ego	is still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of	personality must be discerned through the ego	8528.39845830461
671. the novelist who has	been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that	since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the	same faces	3211.206887873398
672. i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus	complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature	2602.134538075071
673. but a	writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern	dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the	incest myth the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness	4375.832989812627
674. moral dread is seen as the other face of desire and here psychoanalysis	delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem	of great complexity	4318.368863695194
675. there is probably some significance	in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered	in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth	2851.512095646201
676. the ancient types	are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their	destinies but the myth fails before the modern truth; the oracle	speaks false and the dream speaks true	5330.133254148963
677. in both the farmer's tale	in ralph ellison's invisible man and in thomas mann's the	holy sinner the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting	the wish as motive; the heroic act is the casting off of pretense	4133.441273226893
678. thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951	249.80870849519593
679. it was conceived	as a leave-taking a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths	of the west bevor die nacht sinkt eine lange nacht vielleicht	und ein tiefes vergessen	3126.474040593251
680. he chose a medieval legend of	incest gregorius vom stein and freely borrowed and parodied other	myths of the west mixing themes language peoples and times in a master	myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves as in his	previous treatment of joseph	6898.260838913213
681. but the holy sinner is	not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment	1420.7183836877534
682. mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center	of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as	the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated	joke he liked to tell	6934.209772561267
683. and when he retold the legend of gregorius	he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak	contemporary thoughts in archaic language; while they move through	the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through	not-knowing they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other	and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the	twentieth-century manner	5706.706968972858
684. grigorss is the child of an incestuous	union between a royal brother and sister the twins sibylla and	wiligis	2590.8205995245944
685. he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast	adrift soon after birth	1413.3151298891341
686. the infant is discovered by a fisherman who	brings him home to rear him	1410.9404661171038
687. an ivory tablet in the infant's cask	recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child	by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village	3228.9015778076346
688. grigorss at	seventeen learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his	origins	1885.2935632446138
689. his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own	country at a time when sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies	of one of her rejected suitors	3324.3766188122368
690. grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle	delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had	fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him	4665.190345806534
691. sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory	tablet concealed by her husband and the identities of mother and son	are revealed	2734.0643659315174
692. grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen	years	964.6574953047318
693. at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive	the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock	2589.0740724971447
694. grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope	755.4011091260957
695. in	the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience	with the great pope and to give her confession	2461.6195439402786
696. mother and son recognize	each other and in mann's version of this legend make a remarkable	confession of guilt to each other the confession of unconscious	motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the	time they had first set eyes on each other	6913.301765654904
697. in recollection he has said: natural or man-made objects kept coming	into my head but i would suppress them sternly	1896.2921969986194
698. moreover	he organized the movement of his forms within his rigorously shaped space	into highly complex equilibriums; and used gradations of color	value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors	4825.152232904045
699. the worthy	mondrian seeing these pictures said in a tone of kindly reproof:	but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition!	helion did not realize it at the time but it was true	3741.317456695285
700. his	monumental abstraction made up of smooth metallic non-objects	acting upon each other with great tension won helion much	acclaim during the 'thirties	3465.3387618575375
701. the play of novel lighting effects also	entered into these compositions whose controlled power and varied	activity made them well worth meditating	2187.619401867418
702. as helion's work	showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature the pure	abstractionists expressed some disapproval; but leger arp lipchitz	and alexander calder at the time gave him their blessing	5660.136827550423
703. his	canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be figures	in space or blue figure or pink figure; and	they had heads and feet	2599.756878794104
704. exhibited in shows in london in	1935 and in new york the following year the new more elaborated	abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional	dramas of great intellectual coherence	5618.182929872824
705. at this period	the thirty-year old helion was ranked as one of the mature leaders	of the modern movement according to herbert read and in the	direct line of descent from cezanne seurat gris and leger	3853.9648979894737
706. in	america meyer schapiro observed that unlike the mondrian school	helion sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the	framework of abstract art	4107.006588370952
707. it is notable that at this time	he was writing with admiration of cimabue's and poussin's way	of filling space	1865.5556914324964
708. abstract art was still the right path for him; but	he	held instead of continuing as an art of reduction it must grow	must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins	as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian	7028.368437650742
709. later	helion wrote of this phase: for years i built for myself	a subtle instrument of relationships- colors and forms without a name	2312.2086521278534
710. i played on it my secret songs unexplained passionate and peaceful	749.7213440332004
711. but his own work was evolving further	94.47265803634835
712. the extreme limitations	he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly	arid and cold	2576.8072457279904
713. he was engaged in constant experiments that	searched for new directions	499.0191432115606
714. where would it all lead	22.176880685693376
715. he himself	did not know as he said in 1935	373.58534263844024
716. but he was afraid of the future-	he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration a functional	art of some kind	3690.275552550568
717. during the 1920's the abstractionists	the german bauhaus group of industrial designers and the new	architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia or welfare	state in which their neat and logical constructions might find their	proper place	4220.312019375247
718. but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem	to helion to be determined to escape from the real world or simply	to rebel against it the ordered abstractions which he and his	associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of improving	things	6681.3154821618255
719. we were possessed by visions of a new civilization	to come very pure and elevated he has said in fact some ideal	form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918	3869.762532517047
720. instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic	depression the rise of fascist dictators in europe the wasting	civil war in spain	3484.5481904995904
721. very much the political man helion felt himself	deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france	and all europe whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky	3101.4483199393567
722. in 1936 he decided to migrate to america	250.90276478434993
723. the rooseveltian america	was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute	the last best hope for civilization	2190.4738071073402
724. helion also hoped that	america's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be	accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works	3477.3843571753323
725. i arrived	in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there	more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions	2327.1362152040647
726. in new york he was well received by what was then only	a small brave band of non-figurative artists including alexander calder	george k l morris de kooning holty and a few others	5302.654005691472
727. after a year in a studio on sheridan square having married an	american girl who was a native of virginia helion moved to a village	in the blue ridge mountains where he produced some of the most	imposing of his abstract canvases	4382.443735442953
728. the darkening world scene	at the time of the munich pact continued to trouble his mind even in	his remote virginia studio	3275.3994901851556
729. fear possessed me and the certainty	of war he has related	503.7028272768004
730. i truly smelled blood death heaps of	corpses everywhere	389.2435237736223
731. in haste he labored to finish some last abstract	paintings: a three-panel frieze with a flying figure and a fallen	figure; a double-figure which went to the chicago art	institute and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts;	and in early 1939 a fallen figure of very ominous character	which concluded his abstract phase	5388.330138952324
732. i knew i was carrying	on with abstraction to its very end- for me he said of the two	years' output in virginia	3473.290998410579
733. with those paintings of big constructions	crashing down he felt he could stop	792.096530782286
734. they were in effect his last	testament to non-objective art	558.9781714457209
735. he had taken out first papers	for american citizenship; but after war came to europe he decided	to return to france arriving there in january 1940	2712.527259534153
736. i hated	the war he said but thought i ought to go because i was perhaps	one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it	4059.8871501594354
737. in june 1940 sergeant helion with a company of reserve troops waiting	to go into battle was sketching the hills south of the loire	river when the war suddenly rolled in upon him	3554.172149294553
738. its first apparition	was a long gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons or pushing	prams	2119.928468577266
739. his company then carried out a confused retreating movement	until it was surrounded by the germans a few days before france capitulated	2167.287963689404
740. after a sort of death march during four days without food	helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp	at an estate farm in east germany	4819.283701206065
741. a year later they were removed to	a stalag in the harbor of stettin	934.509568340827
742. at the time of his capture helion	had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth's in	new york	3060.393456084884
743. when he was stripped deloused and numbered by his guards	his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners'	goods to be confiscated	2730.469752071455
744. it was then i knew that they were	making war against man the individual within!- who questioned	things when given orders	3026.5742617645406
745. at stettin the university-educated	artist who had studied german was chosen to serve as interpreter	and clerk in the office of the stalag commander	2464.6627490114874
746. in secret he also	acted as a member of the prisoners' central committee which plotted	sabotage planned a few escapes and maintained a hidden control over	the wretched french slave-laborers	4839.651122808622
747. in the stalag helion	came to know and love his comrades most of them plain folk who in	their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each	other	3325.4063125003245
748. how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground	committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped	to escape	4287.495927225367
749. in the prison camp's black market civilian clothes were	quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him; during long	weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed	2970.73831036507
750. every morning	contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories	1396.379423499781
751. one evening while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard	among the prisoners remaining there a simulated melee was staged-	just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from	work	3759.7279242692553
752. as helion wrote afterward:   their sentry followed	h four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me	2576.866651062737
753. marquet	held my briefcase; finot held a wallet with my money and papers;	moineau and david held nothing but their fingers h they felt	rough and kind and warm	3086.940034028251
754. at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground	250.6555824403888
755. duclos ran toward desprez with fists raised	93.01767381490336
756. the guards all	rushed up to intervene h   shedding his prison cloak helion	shot through the gates now clad in civilian garments and with the	passport of a flemish worker	4835.083816438644
757. riding trains hitching hikes on trucks	across germany slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of	secret guides he eventually reached vichy france and by the winter	of 1943 was back in virginia	3531.212750295058
758. he wrote:   to escape from	a prison camp required a very special state of mind; not only loathing	of captivity but a faith a hope that is even stronger	4676.614765508953
759. i left	behind me brave men whom captivity had robbed of all hope	788.5213815418326
760. they too	loved their families longed for their villages: yet lacked the faith	that drove one to dare h the fearful chance of escape	3684.02275105044
761. it was a time of revelations for him	165.91763176469001
762. even the most rational of men	under great stress may be transported by a new faith and behave like	mystics	2813.980726181265
763. helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice	of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 stettin as to	his own fierce	will and love of life	3107.0941999703537
764. after that he declared to return to	freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore	it	3028.8269266753887
765. in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from	life his guards his companions in misery	1726.6408823023842
766. now all his desires centered	on rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful	world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence	4838.756966223222
767. and he added: during the many months in prison camp all	abstract images vanished from my mind	1418.9322678529493
768. before leaving for america	he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to	him his new resolutions	2819.4754681938066
769. arp protested: but it is impossible!	everything in the way of representation has already been done by the	old masters	1879.463687639228
770. helion however clung to the belief that in escaping	from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction	2357.263620139022
771. while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording	his prison experiences and escape entitled: they shall not have	me h published originally in english by dutton	+ co of new york in 1943 the book was received by the press	as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic	accounts of world war 2 from the french side	4883.615344803628
772. it was very widely	read too; and the author who seemed the embodiment of france's	rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors was much complimented	for his daring military action	4810.941689408128
773. but when he showed his new figurative	pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp they paid him	no compliments and drew long faces	2604.931633916419
774. between 1944 and 1947 helion	had a series of one-man shows- at the paul rosenberg gallery	in new york and in paris- of his new realistic pictures	4294.569130737471
775. they reincarnated	the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since	the 1920's	935.281041078231
776. these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace	objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking	about as the things they missed most hence associated with the sense	of lost freedom: the cafe at the corner the newspaper kiosk the girls	in doorways and windows along the street the golden-crusted french	bread they lacked the cigarettes denied them	8527.091495633005
777. one of the pictures	was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette;	others were of men doffing their hats to each other carrying	umbrellas with pomp reading newspapers or simply showing loaves of	bread spread out	4366.45933432986
778. important as was mr o'donnell's essay his thesis is	so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has	3054.3566554928357
779. he and also mr cowley and mr warren have fallen to the temptation	which besets many of us to read into our authors- nathaniel	hawthorne for example and herman melville- protests against	modernism material progress and science which are genuine protests of	our own but may not have been theirs	4939.836359645824
780. faulkner's total works today	and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr cowley	made his comment or in 1939 when mr o'donnell wrote his	essay reveal no such simple attitude toward the south	6059.40327689391
781. if he is a	traditionalist he is an eclectic traditionalist	373.28895980090545
782. if he condemns the	recent or the present he condemns the past with no less force	1894.4144495567573
783. if he	sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen he sees also- and he	shows- the blind and the mean and he sees the compson family disintegrating	from within	3373.1001244777194
784. if the barn-burner's family produces a flem	snopes who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic	crassness the compson family produces a jason compson 4	3686.859432084024
785. faulkner	is a most untraditional traditionalist	43.51191256821041
786. others writing on	faulkner have found the phrase traditional moralist either inadequate	or misleading	1418.069027744909
787. among them are frederick j hoffman william	van o'connor and mrs olga vickery	789.231102328083
788. they have indicated	the direction but they have not been explicit enough i believe in	pointing out faulkner's independence his questioning if not indeed	challenging the southern tradition	4457.235567493541
789. faulkner's is not the mind	of the apologist which mr o'donnell implies that it is	1098.5454304727352
790. he is	not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body	of social cultural or literary traditions than he was within the traditions-	or possibly the regulations- governing his tenure in the	post office at oxford mississippi thirty-five years ago	6624.2054262432885
791. that	is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that	he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in	his books	3437.0630144911943
792. it is to say rather i believe that he has brought to bear	on the history the traditions and the lore of his region a critical	skeptical mind- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate	experimenter in literary form and technique	6841.6090519745
793. he has employed from	his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed	southern	1574.13012190181
794. the fact that he has cast over those materials the light	of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern i rather	think for the south has been no more solid than other regions except	in the political and related areas where patronage and force and	intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity	8085.831877521472
795. some of us might	be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action	and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical	are particularly southern traits	3233.1981549434704
796. there is no necessity i suppose	to assert that mr faulkner is southern	1175.483529390984
797. it would not be	easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his	family	1410.2274103564
798. and after all he has lived comfortably at both oxford mississippi	and charlottesville virginia	1422.004277413229
799. the young william faulkner	in new orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist hamilton	basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner and there is no	evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so	4041.9512719052027
800. besides showing no inclination apparently to absent himself from his	native region even for short periods and in addition writing a shelf	of books set in the region he has handled in those books an astonishingly	complete list of matters which have been important in the south	during the past hundred years	7616.659319756238
801. it is more difficult with faulkner	than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is	the source of his knowledge	2459.4351528870075
802. his own testimony is that he has read very	little in the history of the south implying that what he knows of	that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around	him primarily from his own unassisted observation	6706.175052479275
803. his denials of extensive	reading notwithstanding it is no doubt safe to assume that he	has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has	gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived	in the south or have written about the south	4756.599637634405
804. to believe otherwise	would be unrealistic	65.31325198754135
805. but in looking at faulkner against	his background in mississippi and the south it is important not to	lose the broader perspective	2183.8378115954292
806. his earliest work reflected heavy influences	from english and continental writers	754.9766009679854
807. evidence is plentiful that	early	and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers	who deal in extravagant horror to the symbolists writing at the end	of the preceding century and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness	novelists henry james and james joyce among them	4691.6928468299275
808. his repeated	experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence	of mind and an originality of approach but it also shows him	touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him	5806.315094325698
809. my intention therefore is not to say that faulkner's awareness	has been confined within the borders of the south but rather that	he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook	is southern	4050.700074723206
810. the ingredients of faulkner's novels and	stories are by no means new with him and most of the problems he takes	up have had the attention of authors before him	4829.420240800925
811. a useful comment	on his relation to his region may be made i think by noting briefly	how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated	from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining	faithful to the essential character of the region	4675.446917880219
812. the planter	aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton	kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait	of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated	the most persistent tradition of southern literature	6059.194740321236
813. the thoroughgoing	idealization of the planter society did not come however	until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend	a way of life which had been destroyed	3316.179196716119
814. as they looked with nostalgia	to a society which had been swept away they were probably no more	than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed	4646.284097642169
815. their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the	south even while memories of the war were still sharp	2021.6000499415732
816. the tradition	reached its apex perhaps in the works of thomas nelson page toward	the end of the century and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934	in the best-selling novel so red the rose by stark young	5933.206694234944
817. although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition	he did not have stark young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize	the planter society	2733.2826293973135
818. the myth of the southern plantation	has had only a tangential relation with actuality as francis	pendleton gaines showed forty years ago and i suspect it has had a	far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed	6365.037651795979
819. faulkner has found it useful but he has employed it with his	habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook	1727.6506226251145
820. without saying or	seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families	faulkner's chief concern is social criticism we can say nevertheless	that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the	planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil	war	7232.113051242132
821. it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional	pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment	in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen	glasgow who was the only important novelist before him to challenge	the conventional picture of planter society	5195.988482102587
822. faulkner's low-class	characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels	dealing with plantation life	1642.2848397144676
823. they have an ancestry extending back	however at least to 1728 when william byrd described the lubberlanders	he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina	2994.290410668791
824. the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the	realistic humorous writing which originated in the south and the	southwest in the three decades before the civil war	4853.771715882063
825. these narratives	of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers	as a rule and later found their way between book covers though	rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes	of horace mr addison mr pope and sir walter scott	4541.972530406919
826. there is evidence to suggest in fact that many authors of the humorous	sketches were prompted to write them- or to make them as indelicate	as they are- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements	which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south	7096.269785886499
827. william	gilmore simms sturdy realist that he was pleaded for a natural	robustness such as he	found in his favorites the great elizabethans	to vivify the pale writings being produced around him	3468.1810346784064
828. simms admired	the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods but he had himself social	affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully	3692.150435793429
829. augustus	baldwin longstreet a preacher and a college and university president	in four southern states published the earliest of these backwoods	sketches and in the character ransy sniffle in the accounts of	sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat and in the shockingly	unliterary speech of his characters he set an example followed	by many after him	5328.465813166378
830. others who wrote of low characters and low	life included thomas bangs thorpe creator of the big bear of arkansas	and tom owen the bee-hunter; johnson jones hooper whose	character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in	both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the	sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will; and george	washington harris whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood	perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain	than any other character in literature	0.30166232349522504
831. it would be profitable i believe	to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner's works	the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything	to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with	a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our	time to faulkner's time	5417.518372164678
832. such a comparison reminds us that in employing	low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality	in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent	4489.813326420826
833. such characters with their low existence and often low morality	produce humorous effects in his novels and tales as they did in	the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris but it need not be	added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than	they had in the earlier writers; nor is there need to add that among	them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful	of his characters	0.20124717349522497
834. one of the early humorists already mentioned	thomas bangs thorpe can be used to illustrate another point	where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier	literary treatment of those materials	5005.5246774706775
835. thorpe came to louisiana from	the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting	of romantic adventure and idealized beauty	2735.3634903236007
836. but thorpe saw also	the hardships of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier	settlements and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions	4093.31462979176
837. as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and	feelings he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips	and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble arkansas	where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece	of frontier humor the big bear of arkansas in which	earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods	tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the	mysteries of nature	0.20124717349522497
838. some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made	up of members of the british association for the advancement of	science that man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are now	in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice	age	6704.595311582581
839. as a humanist dr huxley interests himself in the possibilities	of human development and one thing we can say about this	suggestion which comes from a leading zoologist is that so far as he	is concerned the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon	the idea of future human evolution	4952.493233318619
840. this text from dr huxley	is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission	of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment	of psychic powers in human beings	5458.387950911877
841. there may be a case of this sort	but it is not one we wish to argue here	1571.1474127458555
842. even if people do in a	not far distant future begin to read one another's minds there will	still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind	is especially worth reading- worth more that is than what you can	read in good books	7114.397962343069
843. even if men eventually find themselves able to	look through walls and around corners one may question whether this	will help them to live better lives	2727.6676595038634
844. there would be side-conclusions	to be drawn of course; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing	to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts	of biologists and organic evolutionists; but the basic puzzles	of existence would still be puzzling and we should still have to work	out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article	8458.269349219836
845. all we want from dr huxley's statement is the feeling that this	is an open world in the view of the best scientific opinion with	practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next and	no important confinements with respect to what may be possible	4686.5142527328335
846. it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human	beings arise from the fact that man is not one but many	3661.9562292681935
847. each man	that is is both one and many	265.39256589588956
848. he is a dreamer of the good society with	a plan to put into effect and he is an individual craftsman with	something to make for himself and the people of his time	5332.74199784962
849. he is a parent	with a child to nurture here and now and he is an educator who worries	about the children half way round the world	2870.551704313238
850. he is a utopian with	a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the	circumstances of today	3274.3743330111797
851. he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and	he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself	785.3216565669628
852. he is a craig's wife who agonizes	about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful	genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the	local university have come to call	6062.555236845208
853. he is the stern guardian of the status	quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age and he	is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic	apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed	4467.199496347712
854. what will be	the final symmetry of the good society	559.2237299251825
855. for what do the utopians	labor	43.66272370851009
856. here on a desk is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts	of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions	3904.6400110091877
857. the pamphlets are about law the corporation forms of government the	idea of freedom the defense of liberty the various lethargies which	overtake our major institutions the gap between traditional social	ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their	realization	4596.572315053075
858. the thing that is notable in all these discussions is	the lack of ideological ardor	1651.3232253336798
859. there is another kind of ardor a quiet	sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life but no	angry utopian contentions	2167.4673746016906
860. actually you could wish for some passion	now and then but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos	of current history which partisan social passions have wrought	you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized	calm	6937.85427664156
861. you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving	quality of maturity	939.8907082631215
862. there is essential pleasantness in reading the	writing of men who are not angry who can contend without quarreling	2566.937326066537
863. this is the good kind of sophistication and with all our problems	and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states	during recent years	2851.5789573017387
864. a characteristic expression of such concern	and inquiry is found in joseph p lyford's introduction to the	agreeable autocracies a recent paperback study of the institutions	of modern democratic society	4821.82973380647
865. mr lyford gives voice to a temper	that represents we think an achieved plateau of reflective thinking	1421.2576735077025
866. after casting about for a way of describing this spirit we decided	that it would be better to use mr lyford's introduction as	an illustration	3890.5236649451945
867. he begins:   at one time it seemed as if	the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example	of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations	3576.646686739302
868. as	things turned out however we have not profited greatly from the lesson:	instead of persistently following a national program of our own	we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed	to be at the moment	6306.009131634178
869. such activity may or may not have irritated	the kremlin but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural	defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the	free world	3460.637548208239
870. the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another	bad habit our tendency to rate the goodness or badness	of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate	about ourselves	5296.169083335115
871. since the slogans have little application to	reality and are sanctimonious to boot the applause is faint even in areas	of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection	for free government	3770.3255411730743
872. shocked at the response to our proclamations	we grow more defensive and worse we lose our sense of humor and proportion	3051.0626225373553
873. mr nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by	our department of state and an american president observes sourly	that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more	capitalistic	3762.0079070029265
874. one thing you can say about mr lyford is	that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american	2828.3981163468625
875. those	who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination	372.5179434105152
876. only the strong	look squarely at weakness	140.6683900713569
877. the maturity in this point of view lies	in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being	clearly understood	2174.5120937902957
878. mr lyford continues:   even if the	self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it	would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society	4654.288394792972
879. we	would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries	374.9606572050194
880. the	picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american	life	1411.948786948703
881. the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what	we practice or tolerate is great and it does not escape the notice	of others	2458.5598908455227
882. if our sincerity is granted and it is granted the discrepancy	can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe	hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding	gained by earnest self-examination	6057.75378841491
883. what is more the legends have become	so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism	smells of low treason and men who practice it are defeatists and	unpatriotic scoundrels	3342.707469732628
884. h although we continue to pay our	conversational devotions to free private enterprise individual	initiative the democratic way government of the people	competition of the marketplace etc we live rather comfortably	in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in	large areas bureaucracy is corroding representative government technology	is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make	decisions and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically	into the ground	0.30166232349522504
885. the interesting thing about mr	lyford's approach and the approach of the contributors to the	agreeable autocracies to the situation	of american civilization is that it is concerned with comprehending	the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect	on american life	4376.666849808902
886. in an ideological argument the participants tend	to thump the table	747.2165012438575
887. they are determined to prove something	43.50048932684751
888. the	new spirit so well illustrated by mr lyford's work is wholly	free of this anxiety	1887.6670491371606
889. the problem is rather to find out what is actually	happening and this is especially difficult for the reason that we	are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present sometimes	by the very agencies- our educational system our mass media our	statesmen- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding	of ourselves	5339.2039696878
890. the introduction continues:   we experience	a vague uneasiness about events a suspicion that our political	and economic institutions like the genie in the bottle have escaped	confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them	5902.3323115376
891. we feel	uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television	set but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and	what they are doing to us we can hardly learn to control them	4142.127515674513
892. it does	not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles	on the national purpose	2343.5814147013375
893. the agreeable autocracies	is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect	and determine the character of the free society today	2476.2834570811347
894. the men who	speculate on these institutions have for the most part come to at least	one common conclusion: that many of the great enterprises and associations	around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic	in nature and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate	the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern	world	8415.093987472052
895. these institutions which mr lyford names agreeable	autocracies- where did they come from	786.5634999962779
896. of one thing we	can be sure: they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists	of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles	and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the free	society	6040.322681138639
897. no doubt there are historians who can explain to a	great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth	century	2329.926968093272
898. going back over this ground and analyzing the composition	of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken	by the center for the study of democratic institutions in	santa barbara	5637.46486666769
899. but however we come finally to explain and account	for the present the truth we are trying to expose right now is that	the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find	it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host	of all their enterprises	4870.300025567719
900. the host is the flowing life of the human race	560.6609699827404
901. this life has its own currents and rhythms its own multiple cycles	and adaptations	949.3281637983348
902. on occasion it produces extraordinary novelties	64.54840936974063
903. should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory	for the advent of television atomic energy and ibm machines	2177.4998594917724
904. how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the	field	756.705494602372
905. they tell us sir that we are free because we have in one	hand a ballot and in the other a stock certificate	2323.576547954516
906. with these we	shape our destiny and own private property and that sir makes ours	the best of all possible societies	3059.4879301099963
907. the reality of the situation however	is described by mr lyford:   many of us may even	be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient	civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts	3747.518040015892
908. thus the member	of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business	agents who may proceed without interference or recall; the stockholder	delivers his proxy; and the citizen narrows his political participation	to the mere act of voting- if he votes at all	6919.821138201213
909. copernicus did not question it ptolemy could not	165.99381545993543
910. given the conceptual	context within which ancient thought thrived how could anyone have	questioned this principle	1883.3704977123148
911. the reasons for this are partly observational	partly philosophical and reinforced by other aesthetic and	cultural factors	1424.1852588770016
912. the obvious	natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the	heavens	1416.8807733925578
913. not only did constellations like draco cepheus and cassiopeia	spin circles around the pole but stars which were not circumpolar	rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night	3452.757223392681
914. nor did	a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their	nocturnal flights	1644.720613770045
915. the conclusion- the distances of the constellations	did not vary and their paths were circular	1094.0282926889113
916. moreover the sun's	path over earth described a segment of a great circle; this was	clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after	noon	4854.053160323113
917. as early as the 6th century bc the earth	was seen to be spherical	945.8626947499167
918. ships disappear hull-first over the horizon;	approaching shore their masts appeared first	964.3622943975728
919. earth being at	the center of the universe would have the same shape as the latter;	so eg did aristotle argue although this may not be an observational	reason in favor of circularity	3551.7592439394816
920. the discoid shapes of	sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things	2113.1287488100234
921. in light of all this one would require special reasons for	saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular	2318.6208350873253
922. why for example should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation	of the heavens to be elliptical	2130.4643571688975
923. or oviform	0.20041515
924. or angular	0.30041514999999996
925. there were no reasons for such suppositions then	165.46976499488642
926. this conjoined	with the considerations above made the circular motions of heavenly	bodies appear an almost directly observed fact	2599.31384445164
927. additional philosophical	considerations advanced notably by aristotle supported further	the circularity principle	639.3656630031176
928. by distinguishing superlunary	and sublunary existence and reinforcing this with	the four-element physics of empedocles aristotle came to speak of	the stars as perfect bodies which moved in only a perfect way viz	in a perfect circle	5913.6808413210765
929. now what is perfect motion	14.77206552851776
930. it must	apparently be motion without termini	140.22419450828085
931. because motion which begins and	ends at discrete places would be incomplete	639.4974990795765
932. circular motion however since it is eternal and perfectly continuous	lacks termini	961.2168081435248
933. it is never motion towards something	43.698103901194635
934. only imcomplete	imperfect things move towards what they lack	389.4485327347477
935. perfect complete	entities if they move at all do not move towards what they lack	1090.3838475283983
936. they move only in accordance with what is in their natures	749.7333181076009
937. thus circular	motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely	perfect celestial existence	1100.5684171640892
938. to return now to the four-element	physics a mixture of muddy frothy water will when standing in	a jar separate out with earth at the bottom water on top and the	air on top of that	5761.406972254642
939. a candle alight in the air directs its flame and	smoke upwards	642.4376285450659
940. this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements	560.5423151271864
941. thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe	374.6616559879046
942. it is covered	with water air is atop of that	557.126860526789
943. pure fire is in	the heavens	43.80232732772454
944. when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms	of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material	substratum it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a	scale of material-formal ratios celestial bodies will be of a subtle	quickened ethereal existence in whose embodiment pure form will be	the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary	8619.204949306342
945. the stars constitute an order of existence different from what	we encounter on earth	937.6548177816012
946. this is clear when one distinguishes the types	of motion appropriate to both regions	1410.1486395064837
947. a projectile shot up from earth	returns rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest	940.2218201854382
948. but the	natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest nor rectilinear	motion	1416.0663586123092
949. being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake	more of what is divine	786.0544212279922
950. their motion will be eternal and perfect	140.20260750550196
951. let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic	and copernican astronomy	504.2278004350319
952. bluntly there never was a ptolemaic system	of astronomy	391.4579792753924
953. copernicus' achievement was to have invented	systematic astronomy	167.2164317926217
954. the almagest and the hypotheses outline	ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational	tables independent calculating devices for the prediction	of future planetary perturbations	4492.4110313305355
955. indeed in the halma edition of theon's	presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting	out otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing	the planetary motions	2603.444077461346
956. no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld	into a single scheme these independent predicting-machines	1644.5474273407901
957. they all have this in common: the earth is situated	near the center of the deferent	1257.1902969156624
958. but that one should superimpose all	these charts run a pin through the common point and then scale each	planetary deferent larger and smaller	this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses	5331.054788745435
959. he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity	372.5402077188579
960. ptolemy's	problem is to forecast where against the inverted bowl of night some	particular light will be found at future times	3050.1999782656
961. his problem concerns	longitudes latitudes and angular velocities	167.26651165752745
962. the distances of these	points of light is a problem he cannot master beyond crude conjectures	as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth	4518.0930742797145
963. but none of this has prevented scientists philosophers and even	historians of science from speaking of the ptolemaic system in	contrast to the copernican	2470.9963253958417
964. it is engendered by	confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the	geocentric astronomy	1656.4999267504268
965. ptolemy recurrently denies that he could	ever explain planetary motion	373.92943464675443
966. this is what necessitates the nonsystematic	character of his astronomy	564.870323589608
967. so when textbooks like that	of baker set out drawings of the 'ptolemaic system' complete	with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged	on their several deferents we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century	idea of what never existed historically	4543.053533086577
968. it is	the chief merit in copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations	are interdependent	1636.2534040299709
969. he cannot eg compute the retrograde	arc traveled by mars without also making suppositions about the	earth's own motion	1734.2889177474947
970. he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining	some form of	a three-body problem	964.836391927812
971. in ptolemaic terms however eclipses	and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter to be explained	directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations	2031.3938443532538
972. in a	systematic astronomy like that of copernicus retrogradations become	part of the conceptual structure of the system; they are no longer	a puzzling aspect of intricately variable local planetary motions	4975.716796909652
973. another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs	copernican astronomy turns on the idea of simplicity	1093.8848619536288
974. it is often	stated that copernican astronomy is 'simpler' than ptolemaic	757.1247226380125
975. some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of	the former	1097.5696226845462
976. thus margenau remarks: a large number of unrelated	epicycles was needed to explain the observations but otherwise the	ptolemaic system served well and with quantitative precision	4075.9618478795114
977. copernicus	by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe	was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen	2452.9221281241403
978. historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the	fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution' unaware perhaps	of its historical importance he rested content with having produced	a simpler scheme for prediction	5129.701974937927
979. as an illustration of the principle	of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because	it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves a reduction	in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen	3739.8382585647146
980. without careful qualification this can be misleading	140.49889367347913
981. if in any one	calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once	while copernicus never required more than one third this number then	ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler	than copernican	3548.0861821119047
982. but no single planetary problem ever required	of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time	1872.014665818755
983. this of course results	from the non-systematic 'cellular' character of ptolemaic	theory	646.6033743566588
984. calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions	about planetary configurations	754.7520761032717
985. these could be met only by considering	the dynamical elements of several planets at one time	1263.2167614933073
986. this	is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces	his isolated problems	2112.9177492644158
987. thus in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity'	is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican	1107.0203845594392
988. the latter required	juggling several elements simultaneously	140.5256553309213
989. this was not simpler	but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy's astronomy	791.2408129955198
990. analogously anyone who argues that einstein's theory of	gravitation is simpler than newton's must say rather more to explain	how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists while	the former can be managed only by accomplished experts	6172.57783824909
991. in a sense einstein's theory is simpler than newton's	and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus' theory	is simpler than ptolemy's	2340.0127489572415
992. but 'simplicity' here refers to	systematic simplicity	139.9093698565926
993. the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple	theories is reduced to a minimum	793.6572330778687
994. the axioms required to	make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully	so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced	rigorously back to these axioms rules and primitive notions	5652.507256379606
995. this	characterizes euclid's formulation of geometry but not ptolemy's	astronomy	373.8683813307294
996. there are in the almagest no rules for determining	in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with	abberations in lunar solar or planetary behavior	4477.992796970745
997. the strongest	appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this: ideally	the justification for dealing with special problems in particular	ways is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory	3550.0786742255646
998. the	lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc' never introduced ex	post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum	3281.9472984904023
999. copernicus to an extent unachieved by ptolemy approximated to	euclid's vision	498.6278561767992
1000. de revolutionibus is not just a collection of	facts and techniques	755.8426496378868
1001. it is an organized system of these things	166.7118884511222
1002. solving	astronomical problems requires for copernicus not a random search	of unrelated tables but a regular employment of the rules defining	the entire discipline	3684.045349638503
1003. hence noting the simplicity achieved	in copernicus' formulation does not provide another reason for	the acceptance of de revolutionibus another reason beyond its	systematic superiority	2577.7468763101388
1004. it provides exactly the same reason	65.0409454999414
1005. 1543 ad is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific	revolution	643.6641581736433
1006. it is really the funeral day of scholastic science	392.2195596217831
1007. granted	the cosmological philosophical and cultural reverberations	initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence	during the 300 years to follow	2322.992435480633
1008. but considered within technical	astronomy a different pattern can be traced	757.0331393169362
1009. in what does the	dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist	167.1702125018332
1010. what in the	almagest draws his fire	140.41636414869168
1011. geocentricism per se	0.20041515
1012. no	0.30041514999999996
1013. the	formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus'	primary concern was introduced only to resolve what seemed	to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy namely the 'unphysical'	triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which	the planet's distances were calculated another around which planetary	velocities were computed and still a third center from	which the observations originated	5474.770201818256
1014. this arrangement was for copernicus	literally monstrous: with the ptolemaists it is as though	an artist were to gather the hands feet head and other members	for his images from divers models each part excellently drawn but not	related to a single body; and since they in no way match each other	the result would be a monster rather than a man	8412.03606876537
1015. copernicus	required a systematically integrated physically intelligible astronomy	167.80596034438076
1016. his objective was essentially to repair those aspects of orthodox	astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends	2587.194247727558
1017. that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy's theory was not	discovered de novo by copernicus	941.4199847170578
1018. the critical rigorous examinations	of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context	for nicholas copernicus' own work	2820.538059750398
1019. the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies	93.46131590574079
1020. without abandoning	too much copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically	and mechanically acceptable	1409.0258259415589
1021. he did not think himself to be	firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution	1094.0407917784155
1022. henrietta's feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her	discovery of the coincidence that sara's epitaph in the jewish	cemetery in venice referred to her as the sulamite	4821.938814940674
1023. into	the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta	as every artist delights to do wove strands of her own intuitive insights	into human nature and-	especially in the remarkable story of the	attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters	as this pair- into the relations of men and women: in their	relations she was the giver and he the receiver nay the demander	0.20124717349522497
1024. his	feeling always exacted sacrifices from her	140.73586483214333
1025. h one is so accustomed	to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive and	women as submissive and yielding that our sympathies are usually enlisted	on the side of the man whose love is not returned and we condemn	the woman as a coquette h	4972.651494578978
1026. the very firmness of her convictions and	logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to	make greater efforts; usually this is most exasperating to men who	expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her	sex and when she does not immediately condemn her as eccentric and	unwomanly h	7592.983490961773
1027. she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist	of showing her superiority in argument over a man h	1873.0362415351487
1028. women themselves	have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside	world and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities	of a stronger will even when their affections are withheld h	5943.302940513038
1029. she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where	it can consistently be done	1567.6307188376957
1030. one who invites such trials of character	is either foolhardy overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith	in mankind to see the danger	3697.5258685281733
1031. in any case but the last such a course	is sure to avenge itself upon the individual; the moral powers	no more than the physical and mental can bear overstraining	3232.47356700759
1032. and in	the last case a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding	nature h	1894.7742044273837
1033. henrietta was discovering in the process of	writing as the born writer does not merely a channel for the discharge	of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the	creative powers of observation insight and intuition	4041.022844879083
1034. dr	isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of	sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine	or harper's but he decided that its jewish subject probably	would not interest them and published it in the messenger	so our readers will be benefited instead	7512.454339330434
1035. under her father's	influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects	outside the jewish field but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish	papers and thus increased her output and her audience	3937.235110348859
1036. and	she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus	performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december	3492.737211401967
1037. by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that	papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration	2838.634850555942
1038. another source of intellectual stimulus was opened	to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within	walking distance of home	3660.6756205746415
1039. it was established in a couple of buildings	in the shopping district with only a few professors but all eminent	men and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings	3327.1416513488307
1040. in september '76 thomas huxley darwin's famous disciple came	from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening	of the university; and although it was a school for men only it	afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures	6709.460107806126
1041. in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew	theology to johns hopkins students and this brought to the szold	house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to	study and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained	by henrietta and rachel who played and sang for them in the upstairs	sitting room on sunday evenings	5839.1098602018
1042. from philadelphia came cyrus	adler and joseph	jastrow	249.40680812701325
1043. adler judge sulzberger's nephew came to study assyriology	168.1814709904363
1044. a smart shrewd and ambitious young man well connected and with	a knack for getting in the good graces of important people he was	bound to go far	4455.846642517962
1045. joseph jastrow the younger son of the distinguished	rabbi marcus jastrow was a friendly round-faced fellow with a	little mustache whose field was psychology and who was also a punster	and a jolly tease	3674.832795391001
1046. his father was a good friend of rabbi szold and	joe lived with the szolds for a while	2355.028748762832
1047. both these youths who greatly	admired henrietta were somewhat younger than she as were also	the neighboring friedenwald	boys who were then studying medicine;	and bright though they all were they could not possibly compete for	her interest with papa whose mind- although he never tried to dazzle	or patronize lesser lights with it- naturally eclipsed theirs and	made them seem to her even younger than they were	5868.2269657981215
1048. besides miss henrietta-	as she was generally known since she had put up her hair	with a chignon in the back- had little time to spare them from her	teaching and writing; so cyrus adler became interested in her friend	racie friedenwald and joe jastrow- the only young man who when	he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta and signed	himself joe- fell in love with pretty sister rachel	0.30166232349522504
1049. henrietta	however was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with	joe's older and more serious brother morris who was just about	her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia	with papa when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph	shalom temple there during its rabbi's absence in europe	5344.081060665458
1050. young	morris who while attending the university of pennsylvania also	taught and edited a paper found time to write henrietta twenty-page	letters on everything that engaged his interest from the acting of sarah	bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of	sulamith on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the	hebrew union college in cincinnati	8118.87827552678
1051. unlike his younger brother	joe he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as my	dear friend although he praised and envied the elegance and purity	of her style	3205.053935599365
1052. and when he complained of the lack of time for all	he wanted to do henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning	as she and papa did	4826.240558699537
1053. one thing papa had not taught henrietta	was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as	herself	1887.900122915817
1054. she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority	in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the	feminine follies of sara sullam; and in her forthright way	henrietta who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness	to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive	and yielding felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers	to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception- he objected	to her stand on the corbin affair as well as on the radical reforms	of dr wise of hebrew union college- until once in sheer	desperation he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree	on anything	0.30166232349522504
1055. but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters	or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable	lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street	3347.7114238958034
1056. little women	we've got father and mother	and each other h said beth on the first page of louisa alcott's	little women; and i do think that families are the	most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo some five hundred	pages later in that popular story of the march family which had	first appeared when henrietta was eight; and the szold family as	it developed bore a striking resemblance to the marches	0.30166232349522504
1057. mr	march like benjamin szold was a clergyman although of an indeterminate	denomination; and marmee march like sophie szold	was the competent manager of her brood of girls of whom the marches	had only four to the szolds' five	4141.776276952516
1058. but the march girls had their	counterparts in the szold girls	755.9173881755175
1059. henrietta could easily identify	herself with jo march although jo was not the eldest sister	1104.4046013099585
1060. neither	was henrietta hoydenish like jo who frankly wished she were a	boy and had deliberately shortened her name which like henrietta's	was the feminine form of a boy's name	4852.003723438672
1061. but both were high-spirited	and vivacious both had tempers to control both loved languages	especially english and german both were good teachers and wrote for	publication	2730.852486261195
1062. each was her mother's assistant and confidante; and	each stood out conspicuously in the family picture	1883.142775966821
1063. bertha szold	was more like meg the eldest march girl who learned that a	woman's happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling	it not as a queen but a wise wife and mother	3962.011849989215
1064. bertha blue-eyed	like mamma was from the start her mother's daughter destined for	her mother's role in life	2357.4492603901276
1065. sadie like beth march suffered ill	health- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart-	but that never dampened her spirits	2453.1997711426816
1066. when her right hand was incapacitated	by the rheumatism sadie learned to write with her left hand	2102.8005675271606
1067. she	wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments like oh	what fun! a comedy in three acts in which under personages	henrietta appeared as a schoolmarm and bertha	who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta	had been appeared as dummkopf	4768.856717713001
1068. sadie studied piano; played	chopin in the soiree musicale of mr guthrie's pupils;	and she recited hector's farewell to andromache most	movingly to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown	near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting	between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds' in baltimore	7880.067029318676
1069. adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious	mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one	1419.4121236377937
1070. for rachel	conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls- and she did make	a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing	in her silvery tones- there was no particular march counterpart;	but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences	the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere	if not entirely in content- the one being definitely jewish	and the other vaguely christian	0.30166232349522504
1071. the szolds like the marches	enjoyed and loved living together even in troubled times; and	as in the march home any young man who called on the szolds found	himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult	to direct his particular attention to any one of them	5002.800130795401
1072. this	included mamma jolly generous and pretty with whom they all fell	in love just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before	he chose her; and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed	the szold hospitality he felt obliged to send his respects and	his gifts not merely to henrietta in whom he was really interested	but to all the szold girls and mamma	0.30166232349522504
1073. and just as laurie lawrence	was first attracted to bright jo march who found him immature	by her high standards and then had to content himself with her younger	sister amy so joe jastrow who had also been writing henrietta	before he came to johns hopkins had to content himself with her	younger sister pretty rachel	5315.286883054296
1074. and like jo march who saw her sisters	meg and amy involved in lovering before herself henrietta	saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle	by the attraction of suitors rachel by joe jastrow and sadie by	max lo^bl a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions	of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi	8193.326711149133
1075. this time he was making no mistake	93.75683648622532
1076. olgivanna- in her country	the	nickname was a respectful form of address- was not only attractive but	shrewd durable sensible and smart	3263.110046416042
1077. no wonder wright was enchanted-	no two better suited people ever met	639.1903097602069
1078. almost from that day until	his death olgivanna was to stay at his side; but the years that	immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying both for wright	and his montenegrin lady	5136.0587048101825
1079. it must be granted that the flouting	of convention no matter how well intentioned one may be is sure	to lead to trouble or at least to the discomfort that goes with social	disapproval	3644.4690998854567
1080. even so many of the things that happened to wright	and olgivanna seem inordinately severe	1637.4227740617425
1081. their afflictions centered	on one maddening difficulty: miriam held up the divorce proceedings	that she herself had asked for	1726.155989734731
1082. reporters began to trail miriam everywhere	and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright	and his doings	2592.0004231223543
1083. flocks of writs attachments and unpleasant legal	papers of every sort began to fly through the air	1416.5921497475251
1084. the distracted miriam	would agree to a settlement through her legal representative then	change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person	3885.353570138084
1085. at	last her lawyer arthur d cloud gave up the case because she	turned down three successive settlements he arranged	1891.087557586035
1086. cloud made an interesting	statement in parting from his client: i wanted to be	a lawyer and mrs wright wanted me to be an avenging angel	4085.690529983075
1087. mrs wright is without funds	14.854636155646821
1088. the first thing to do is	get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final	disposition of the case	3482.9571887491315
1089. but every time i suggested this to her	mrs wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish	mr wright	2307.640400090929
1090. i am an attorney not an instrument of vengeance	389.65423700824397
1091. miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor	and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take	his place	2319.7415540479087
1092. there were three years of this strange warfare;	and during the unhappy time miriam often would charge that wright and	olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin	4644.037548229206
1093. yet somehow when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to	execute the warrants they would find neither wright nor olgivanna	at home	2167.3680169574623
1094. this showed that common sense had not died out at the county	and village level- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced	woman was not restrained remains a puzzle	4662.638501540378
1095. the misery of miriam's	bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it was	hopeless agonizing and destructive with miriam herself bearing the	heaviest burden of shame and pain	3432.6179290674945
1096. to get an idea of the embarrassment	and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna we	should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person	4970.833611860997
1097. one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring	green toward the end of the open warfare on a beautiful day in june	2605.9074656439116
1098. at this time miriam noel appeared urging on constable henry pengally	whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers	in the neighborhood	4114.63929115869
1099. a troop of reporters brought up the rear	167.45048291172571
1100. miriam	was stopped at the taliesin gate and william weston now the	estate foreman came out to parley	2371.0576303951775
1101. he said that mr wright was	not in and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant	that miriam was waving in the air	2848.968515310869
1102. miriam now ordered pengally to	break down the gate but he said he really couldn't go that far	2359.1713496441957
1103. at	this point mrs frances cupply one of wright's handsome daughters	by his first wife came from the house and tried to calm miriam	as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane	on another sign with a rock	4481.9999311151105
1104. miriam noel wright said here	i am at my own home locked out so i must stand in the road!	then she rounded on weston and cried you always did wright's	dirty work! when i take over taliesin the first thing i'll	do is fire you	7038.729154683421
1105. madame noel i think you had better	go said mrs cupply	507.3254649826698
1106. and i think you had better	leave replied miriam	393.7390993605014
1107. turning to the reporters she asked did	you hear her	373.2893048981968
1108. 'i think you had better leave'! and this	is my own home	964.2794938725523
1109. in the silence that followed miriam walked close	to mrs cupply who drew back a step on her side of the gate	2181.832996729236
1110. then	with staring eyes and lips drawn thin miriam said to the young woman	you are ugly- uglier than you used to be and you were always	very ugly	4678.756953928621
1111. you are even uglier than mr wright	93.9120922645611
1112. the	animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a	natural force; and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that	of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art	6208.957288654593
1113. as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement	at all miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him; she	also went to washington and appealed to senator george william	norris of nebraska the fighting liberal from whose office a sympathetic	but cautious harrumphing was heard	4954.112634718966
1114. then after overtures to	accept a settlement and go through with a divorce miriam gave a ghastly	echo of mrs micawber by suddenly stating i will never leave	mr wright	4833.8813644781585
1115. under this kind of pressure it is not	surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers	1569.1976815672901
1116. miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly but one	can feel the generalized anger in wright's remarks to reporters	when he was asked one morning on arrival in chicago what he thought	of the city as a whole	6455.039203755228
1117. first wright said he was choked by the smoke	which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town	1578.4240306976308
1118. but surely	michigan avenue was handsome	65.08256352594397
1119. that isn't a boulevard it's	a racetrack! cried wright showing that automobiles were considered	to be a danger as early as the 1920's	2331.029372336126
1120. this is a horrible	way to live wright went on	557.7341374572337
1121. you are being strangled by traffic	43.402646132213405
1122. he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty and began	to talk trenchant sense though private anguish showed through in the	vehemence of his manner	4293.917659617244
1123. take a gigantic knife and sweep it over	the loop wright said	641.4600213735825
1124. cut off every building at the seventh	floor	250.0814802370134
1125. you don't need concentration	2.9594302377290083
1126. if	you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams	1182.4296657266402
1127. you'll have some joy in the life of	this city	372.35574019671435
1128. after all that's the job of the architect- to give	the world a little joy	1651.6997941156162
1129. little enough joy was afforded wright	in the spring of 1925 when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin	1712.7729946731056
1130. the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by	a bolt of lightning as though miriam could call down fire from heaven	like a prophet of the old testament	5190.739608071942
1131. a storm did take place that	night and fortunately enough it included a cloudburst that helped put	out the flames	1876.802112930068
1132. later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting	the fire; at any rate heat grew so intense in the main part of the	house that it melted the window panes and fused the k'ang-si pottery	to cinders	5767.414805118084
1133. wright set his loss at $200000 a figure perhaps justified	by the unique character of the house that had been ruined and	the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and	other things that were destroyed	4214.382298214356
1134. in spite of the disaster wright	completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort in which	he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees- a project of	great and appropriate charm that came to nothing	5916.219542889893
1135. amid a shortage of	profitable work the memory of albert johnson's $20000 stood out	in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted away	2324.5975641399236
1136. a series of	conferences with friends and bankers began about this time; and the	question before these meetings was here is a man of international reputation	and proved earning power; how can he be financed so that he	can find the work he ought to do	7042.125810802194
1137. while this was under consideration	dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3	1253.7526005034383
1138. as he made plans for the new taliesin wright also got on	paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation	of all faiths and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping	ramp	6190.179711081246
1139. years were to pass before these plans came off the paper and	wright was justified in thinking as the projects failed that much	of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except	by visitors to taliesin	4469.942090142324
1140. and now there was some question as to	his continued residence there	958.6408463424798
1141. billy koch who had once worked for	wright as a chauffeur gave a deposition for miriam's use that he	had seen olgivanna living at taliesin	2599.664030651134
1142. this might put wright in such	a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin;	nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he	was not compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills useless	hotel bills and useless doctor's bills he could more quickly	provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris	as she preferred	8824.892016176751
1143. miriam sniffed at this and complained that wright	had said unkind things about her to reporters	1252.8823323040206
1144. his reply was everything	that has been printed derogatory to you purporting to have	come from me was a betrayal and nothing yet has been printed which	i have sanctioned	4844.134311414548
1145. what irritated miriam was that wright had told	the papers about a reasonable offer he had made which he considered	she would accept when she tires of publicity	2994.192186086452
1146. from her california	headquarters miriam fired back i shall never divorce mr	wright to permit him to marry olga milanoff	2815.091175114537
1147. then miriam	varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing	a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending and asking	for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with the understanding that wright	would not contest it	3949.5036377912074
1148. the bank of wisconsin sent a representative	to the judge's chambers in madison to give information on wright's	ability to meet the terms	3483.5929725342176
1149. he said that the architect might reasonably	be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment	could be brought to an end and that the bank would accept a mortgage	on taliesin to help bring this about	4046.7287539141303
1150. miriam said that she must be	assured that that other woman olga will not be in luxury while i	am scraping along	3240.9050769034247
1151. this exhausted wright's patience and in consequence	he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite	1414.8390478811477
1152. volstead	laws speed laws divorce laws he said as they now	stand demoralize the individual make liars and law breakers of us in	one way or another and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd	5755.039102596749
1153. if mrs wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning i'll	go either to tokyo or to holland to do what i can	2332.5563285262833
1154. i realize	in taking this stand just what it means to me and mine	1407.7481502905212
1155. here wright	gave a slight sigh of weariness and continued it means more	long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people	making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding	as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me	4905.827980107974
1156. next	day word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce;	but wright stayed in the united states	2812.0780544453437
1157. his mentioning of japan and	holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking	945.4330807119725
1158. no matter	what troubles might betide him this most american of artists knew	in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land	3880.769953861527
1159. in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin but	was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates	1720.2425633341431
1160. more likely you simply told yourself as you handed us the book that	it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline	of incantation	4105.586905072165
1161. for pride's sake i will not say that	the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into	my soul	2186.4164533013927
1162. besides that particular message does no more than weakly echo	the roar in all fresh blood	1881.062150291757
1163. but what you could not know of course	was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american	fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents	were to come if not of age then into a bright taut semblance of it	4618.2331171935875
1164. i do not suppose you ever heard of f scott fitzgerald living	or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you had his legend	would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval	6340.279925609139
1165. neither his appetites his exacerbations nor his despair were	kin to yours	633.5448271334748
1166. he might have been the man in the moon for all you could	have understood him	1888.209388690891
1167. but he was no man in the moon to me	371.49550190740786
1168. although	his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of nor was it for yachts	sports cars tall drinks and swimming pools nor yet for money or	what money buys that i burned i too was burning and watching myself	burn	6533.5525557719175
1169. the flame was simply of a different kind	165.99161864614817
1170. it was symbolized	by that	self-consuming elegiac candle of edna st vincent millay's	that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a	beacon to us but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall	as a funeral taper to last even the evening let alone the night	7800.578851039521
1171. one	should not of course pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume	to linger on	1583.3148112339072
1172. yet this passion for passion now that i look back	on it with passion spent seems somewhat overblown and operatic though	as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes	4805.048976974306
1173. only what	else was she singing but the old song of songs that most ancient	of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves	2863.7528236778617
1174. perhaps this is not so little	65.04408012031311
1175. perhaps the mere fact that by	plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us temporarily	anyway the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their	immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to	which we can attest	4622.39650843944
1176. one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone	casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives	for a lover or a friend; one can take it as no more than another	veil torn from the mystery of the soul	7054.053115416054
1177. but it could also be looked	at from the other end of the spectrum	945.8066123182309
1178. one could see this chemical determinant	as in itself a miracle	757.5069145590958
1179. in any case miss millay's sweet-throated	bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was	not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant	and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since	it required no scenery or props drew from the me that i was when	i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea	5639.627260478874
1180. but all this i	am well aware is the bel canto of love and although i have always	liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone	that i listened i know well enough that it was not	6674.481756620507
1181. if i am to speak	the whole truth about my knowledge of love i will have to stop	trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale	2463.7608059808
1182. there is another side	of love more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie	or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug	4292.570634847036
1183. whether	you experienced the passion of desire i have of course no way	of knowing nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment	of a wish to know for the fact that one constitutes by one's	mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any	speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest	more scandalizing more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from	a stranger	0.20124717349522497
1184. i recoil from the very thought	65.47106121901044
1185. at the same time i am	aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves	at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science	of paradox: if one hates they say it is because one loves;	if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns	they say it is because one desires; and according to them whatever	one fancies one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite	0.20124717349522497
1186. well	normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious		i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion	3057.0745494534126
1187. you	probably would not remember since you never seemed to remember	even	the same moments as i much less their intensity one sunny midday on	fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping	less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance	at the farm	5263.301451675255
1188. i can see us now	22.222109589682358
1189. we had been walking quite briskly	for despite your being so small and me so tall your stride in those	days could easily match mine	2589.59615877979
1190. we had stopped before a shop window	to assess its autumnal display when you suddenly turned to me looking	up from beneath one of your wrong hats and with your nervous ahem!	said: there are things i must tell you about this man you	are marrying which he does not know himself	7640.002989192506
1191. if you had screamed	right there in the street where we stood i could not have felt more	fear	1729.4110176779075
1192. with scarcely a mumble of excuse i fled	248.13862836681656
1193. i fled however	not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise	from you that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you	meant the word things- which you had been galvanizing yourself	to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which	i had already insisted upon finding out for myself	say the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle	because i was resolved as	a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize	life by the throat	0.20124717349522497
1194. i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid	of self-betrayal	965.3604806649403
1195. what i fled from was my fear of what unwittingly	you might betray without meaning to about my father and yourself	2031.3284357500957
1196. but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much	more arbitrary and influential it is than the will	3043.3620118476856
1197. while my memory	holds with relentless tenacity as i cannot too often stress to my wrongs	when it comes to my shames it gestures and jokes and toys with	chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from	them	4299.484827514745
1198. just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside	of the leaf of love memory displeased at being asked to yield its	unsavory secrets dashed ahead of me calling back over its shoulder:	skip it	6148.419401425834
1199. but i will not skip it or cut it	out	370.6446855422853
1200. it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless	victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings	of chance	4478.33274386506
1201. if to be innocent is to be helpless then i had been-	as are we all- helpless at the start	1888.3910923590058
1202. but the time came when i was	no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless	1647.9373346816515
1203. helpless in that	sense i can never be again	262.45339720473646
1204. however i confess my hope that i	will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but	rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh	to reach the bone	5626.126773898193
1205. for innocence of all the graces of the	spirit is i believe the one most to be prayed for	1735.1822842165486
1206. although it is constantly	made to look foolish	it does not	mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks	3478.79808394474
1207. it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when	they seem worst it overlooks them	1872.1300059724795
1208. to innocence a word given is a word	that will be kept	968.6764136677115
1209. instinctively innocence does unto others as it	expects to be done by	643.9826020145185
1210. but when these expectations are once too often	ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according	to the strength of him who possesses it	4471.950922285082
1211. the innocence of which	i speak is i know not incorruptible	503.1683667460164
1212. but i insist upon believing	that even when it is lost it may like paradise be regained	2116.453744184208
1213. however it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking	but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of	it which is innocence in romantic love	3309.505480899691
1214. here if anywhere it is not	wholly incontrovertible	249.28330249676074
1215. to you for instance the word innocence in	this connotation probably retained its biblical or should i say	technical sense and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear	by saying that i lost- or rather handed over- what you would	have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled	and in fact by oath required to hand it over along with what other	goods and bads i had	0.20124717349522497
1216. but to me innocence is far less tangible	248.40794087994982
1217. i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my	trust in you but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved	through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience	a flaming delight that had nothing nothing whatever to do with	friendship or liking let alone with love	5364.783031344564
1218. i knew this knowledge to	be corrupting at the time i acquired it; today these many years later	after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions	and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured i call it	corrupting still	6303.277265684204
1219. you i could swear to it remained innocent	in this sense until the end	935.910137526944
1220. yours but not mine was an age in which	innocence was fostered and carefully- if not perhaps altogether	innocently- preserved	2814.313871406293
1221. you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing	mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across	her face	2584.127397265955
1222. moreover because of the particular blot on your family	escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your	grandmother's part and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle	bed of your childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desired	with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your	whole will sensibility and intelligence upon was to be a lady	8628.094955972485
1223. before	being daughter wife or mother before being cultured	bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen	before being sorry for the poor progressive	about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian	indeed first and foremost you were a lady	4622.879759349868
1224. there was of course	more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than	the sine qua non of her virtue	3891.2210770647844
1225. a lady you made clear to me both	by precept and example never raised her voice or slumped in her chair	never failed in social tact	never pouted or withdrew or	scandalized in company never reminded others of her physical presence	by unseemly sound or gesture never indulged in public scenes or private	confidences never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering	never gossiped or maligned never stressed but always minimized	the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself	0.20124717349522497
1226. with each song he gave verbal footnotes	140.18538888828897
1227. the songs sandburg sang often	reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely	or in fragments	1723.7687871954379
1228. often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons	who had similar ballads or ditties	1420.2909290876023
1229. in due time sandburg was	a walking thesaurus of american folk music	638.019464448271
1230. after he had finished	the first two volumes of his lincoln sandburg went to work	assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the	memory of songs others had taught him	5794.017567508682
1231. he rummaged found composers	and arrangers collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization	with musicians ballad singers and musicologists	2039.381056708514
1232. the	result was a collection of 280 songs ballads ditties brought together	from all regions of america more than one hundred never before published:	the american songbag	4288.988351470438
1233. each song or ditty was prefaced	by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the	song as well as special interest the song had musical arrangement	and most of the chorus and verses	3871.287393438327
1234. the book published in 1927	has been selling steadily ever since	749.4881020404598
1235. as sandburg said at the time:	it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to	the appalachian mountains it is as modern as skyscrapers the volstead	act and the latest oil well gusher	3776.0596570698362
1236. sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer	251.53611054001067
1237. two things	contribute to his popularity	43.18385443847073
1238. first carl respects his audience and	prepares his speeches carefully	562.039138859808
1239. even when he is called upon for impromptu	remarks he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes	1725.4001840416483
1240. he has his own system of shorthand devised by abbreviations: humility	will be humly with will be w and that	will be tt	3479.793822215116
1241. the second reason for his popularity	is his complete spontaneity with the guitar	788.1730718764978
1242. it is a mistake however	to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop	1648.5563646022088
1243. he is no dextrous-fingered	college boy but rather a dedicated humble and bashful	apostle of this instrument	1416.912035845734
1244. at age seventy-four he became what he	shyly terms a pupil of andres segovia the great guitarist of	the western world	3043.8486007970396
1245. it is not easy to become segovia's pupil	166.20676649565038
1246. segovia has written about carl:	his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help	in disciplining them	3041.6139788394257
1247. i found that this precocious grown-up boy of	74 deserved to be taught	781.793825004927
1248. there has long existed a brotherly affection	between us thus i accepted him as my pupil	1889.564158838703
1249. just as in the case of	every prodigy child we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to	show up in the future- if he should master all the strenuous exercises	i inflicted on him	3847.4288856903563
1250. to play the guitar as he aspires will	devour his three-fold energy as a historian a poet and a singer	2846.8169570713553
1251. one	cause of schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to	learn the guitar	1091.8276404997364
1252. i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into	the same sad philosophy	1417.143858350109
1253. the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles	forth a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar	1728.2205589318269
1254. the public's identification of carl sandburg and the guitar	is no happenstance	967.937763772168
1255. nor does carl reject this identity	43.503661174016116
1256. he	is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him	titled the guitar	2366.9969110496845
1257. carl says it is the greatest poem	ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem	to that subtle instrument	2587.106117300787
1258. a portable companion always ready to	go where you go- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant-	to be shared with few or many- just two of you in sweet meditation	5340.172652551706
1259. the new york herald tribune's photographer	ira rosenberg tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a	picture of carl playing a guitar	2607.808244968508
1260. carl hadn't brought his along	22.26561017704054
1261. mr	rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one	373.3103892429921
1262. preferably	said carl one battered and worn such as might be found	in a pawnshop	1655.1456400758045
1263. they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller	of 1162 sixth avenue	637.9089260115575
1264. mr miller was in the shop	the herald tribune story related but was reluctant to have	anybody's picture taken inside because his business was too 'confidential'	for pictures	4451.2544046538915
1265. but after introductions he asked:	'carl sandburg	94.258502817156
1266. well you can pose inside'	22.19936829735178
1267. he wanted mr sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had	displayed behind glass in the center of his shop but the poet eyed this	somewhat distastefully	3107.523831671154

1269. he chose one from mr miller's	window a plain guitar with no fancy polish	945.6575038206307
1270. while the picture	was taken mr miller's disposition to be generous to mr	sandburg increased to the point where he advised 'i won't even	charge you the one dollar rental fee'	5030.460348629694
1271. when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to	be a celebrity carl said a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery	with celerity	2994.0874869655654

1275. he walked home at night	for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley	1103.0452342079284

1277. lewis remembered another newspaperman	asking carl have your ideas changed any since you got	all these comforts	1422.9298053681268
1278. carl thought the question over slowly	and answered: i know a starving man who is fed never remembers	all the pangs of his starvation i know that	4292.472436348106
1279. that was all	he said lewis reports	93.60933613730188
1280. that was all he had to say	141.2440296926697

1285. plain	0.20041515

1337. never until in this work of s-d organization	have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher	1885.7319908514655
1338. the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet	union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that	may lead to peace with justice	4456.205361123294
1339. certainly it is not necessary	to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in	the internal affairs of any nation; by the same token we reject any	soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force	or subversion	4600.699271071925
1340. now this concern for the freedom of other peoples	is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with	more than forty other nations in a common defense effort	4823.022847448311
1341. not for a	moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these	countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our	solemn commitments to them	3648.965476807623
1342. we and our friends are of course	concerned with self-defense	561.4587215713912
1343. growing out of this concern is the realization	that all people of the free world have a great stake in the	progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations	3341.5874868207516
1344. these peoples desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels	of living must not by our neglect be forced to seek help from and	finally become virtual satellites of those who proclaim their hostility	to freedom	5751.8141423617135
1345. but they must have technical and investment assistance	167.1878428355668

1350. to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nations must extend	the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will	inspire hope confidence and progress	4099.270714664574
1351. a rich nation can for a time	without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self-indulgence	making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-	thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful	and prosperous society of nations	4705.79735094009
1352. but the enmities it will incur	the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral	and spiritual softness that will be engendered will in the long term	bring it to economic and political disaster	5777.229111110488
1353. america did not	become great through softness and self-indulgence	261.3645248508492
1354. her miraculous progress	in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy	and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant	with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction in hard work; the readiness	to sacrifice for worthwhile causes; the courage to meet every	challenge; the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the	true path of her own best interests	8141.747793910184
1355. to us and to every nation	of the free world rich or poor these qualities are necessary today	as never before if we are to march together to greater security prosperity	and peace	3571.7924384372454
1356. i believe that the industrial countries are	ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing	nations to achieve progress	3265.0509961069592
1357. the immediate need for	this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's	international balance of payments	1870.6132912175963
1358. our surplus from foreign business	transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the	expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas	to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the	less developed nations	6048.939550276142
1359. in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments	approached four billion dollars	636.3340283518762
1360. continuing deficits of anything	like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth	and check the forward progress of the free world	3717.2075888365885
1361. we must	meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world	trade	1097.2927706295472
1362. further we must induce all industrialized nations of the free	world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less	fortunate	3686.972297151514
1363. this co-operation in this matter will provide both for	the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further	increases in mutually profitable trade	2733.4036833121945
1364. new nations and	others struggling with the problems of development will progress only-	regardless of any outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their	own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it	5469.463063928579
1365. moreover	progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned;	there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane	2868.9928594600797
1366. but just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years	so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith	and determination deserve help	4835.232463436498
1367. respecting their need one of	the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region	1259.6689157735639
1368. here	in two nations alone are almost five hundred million people all working	and working hard to raise their standards and in doing so to	make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology	that would destroy liberty	6443.000658066067
1369. i cannot express to you the depth	of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must co-operate	with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions	as expressed in their different multi-year plans	4053.298916361235
1370. through the	world bank and other instrumentalities as well as through individual	action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face	this titanic challenge	4275.316102539824
1371. i shall continue to urge the american	people in the interests of their own security prosperity and peace	to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and	cheerfully supported	3649.565528669043
1372. free world decisions in this matter may spell the	difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom	2356.05476392133
1373. other countries some of which i visited last month have similar	needs	636.9181384572917
1374. a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations	which are prepared to assist in the development effort	2354.1158669916776
1375. during the	past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western	nations	1254.7159480264963
1376. because of its wealth of experience the organization	for european economic cooperation could help with the initial	studies needed	2600.9792497218446
1377. the goal is to enlist all available economic resources	in the industrialized free world especially private investment	capital	1573.478793606591
1378. by extending this help we hope to make possible the	enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner	2359.330779654627
1379. no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be	imagined	784.0771260435192
1380. if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive	partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have	already achieved a high state of economic advancement we will make	brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom	6806.028393207589
1381. otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed	94.13845006856546
1382. we face indeed what	may be a turning point in history and we must act decisively and wisely	2342.6711273693027
1383. as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives	only from a position of broadly based strength	1420.3754345777759
1384. no matter how	earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree	of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating	the issue of arms reduction	5313.715326515532
1385. until tangible and mutually enforceable	arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the	means of defending our institutions	2017.6649661046845
1386. america possesses an enormous	defense power	65.44189673359128
1387. it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever	risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as	to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support	3453.2653615483564
1388. it is world-wide	knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack	the united states by surprise even though we might sustain great	losses would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction	5317.859405551179
1389. but i once	again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states	except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power	2458.1144059684943
1390. during the past year our long-range striking power unmatched today	in manned bombers has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory	4652.097763186998
1391. in	fourteen recent test launchings at ranges of five thousand miles atlas	has been striking on an average within two miles of the target	2460.081232489958
1392. this is less than the length of a jet runway- well within the circle	of destruction	1873.5401704449487
1393. incidentally there was an atlas firing last	night	167.31860474090902
1394. from all reports so far received its performance conformed to	the high standards i have just described	2133.7604063006324
1395. such performance is a great	tribute to american scientists and engineers who in the past five	years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range	ballistic missiles where america had none before	3780.2876868734625
1396. this	year moreover growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will	enter our active forces some to be armed with polaris missiles	3040.695493167465
1397. these	remarkable ships and weapons ranging the oceans will be capable of	accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth	1876.2902158257607
1398. to meet	situations of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain	our carrier forces our many service units abroad our always ready	army strategic forces and marine corps divisions and the civilian	components	5652.379694107019
1399. the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly	but necessary process	642.7411970739108
1400. it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which	will steadily add to our strength	1881.0820439243466
1401. the deployment of a portion	of these forces beyond our shores on land and sea is persuasive demonstration	of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our	allies for collective security	3222.4510219144486
1402. moreover i have directed that steps	be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to	these allies	3043.8443946962043
1403. this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system	261.2801057146291
1404. next i refer to our program in space exploration which	is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research	and development	3677.601059719622
1405. we note that first america has already	made	great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of	knowledge of astrophysics and space science	2744.7329095439954
1406. these discoveries are of	present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are	important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space	for the ultimate benefit of all mankind	4986.15120363717
1407. second our military	missile program going forward so successfully does not suffer from	our present lack of very large rocket engines which are necessary	in distant space exploration	2972.1748189928467
1408. i am assured by experts that the thrust	of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements	2350.426869421406
1409. third the united states is pressing forward in the development	of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space	for exploration purposes	2587.8272007257847
1410. fourth in the meantime it is necessary	to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately	surrounding the earth	3267.7063231166403
1411. using launch systems presently available	we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite	relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the	globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and	aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the	data we seek	4818.090576485471
1412. fifth we have just completed a year's experience	with our new space law	1188.9906820126948
1413. i believe it deficient in certain particulars	94.45943861063276
1414. suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly	390.50924931534985
1415. the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires	the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual	and	economic sinews of american life	2461.4817818166675
1416. the steady purpose of our society	is to assure justice before god for every individual	1647.3872789250277
1417. we must be	ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing	of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the	issues of the day	3336.6417888499905
1418. a year ago when i met with you the nation	was emerging from an economic downturn even though the signs of resurgent	prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful	5018.231714029173
1419. today our surging strength is apparent to everyone	166.01860227429376
1420. 1960 promises	to be the most prosperous year in our history	752.537888566192
1421. yet we continue	to be afflicted by nagging disorders	260.9691867836696
1422. among current problems that	require solutions participated in by citizens as well as government	are:   the need to protect the public interest in situations of	prolonged labor-management stalemate;   the persistent refusal	to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture;	the continuing threat of inflation together with	the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;   in certain	instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection	of the law	0.30166232349522504
1423. the group upon the issuance of its first press release on december	21 1957 designated itself a committee of investigation	1884.4707308751451
1424. in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses	1181.8649972850649
1425. it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer adolf a berle	jr once	644.7050372368702
1426. its second press release was on january 15	1958 and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed	2348.9850136707655
1427. it also	implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible	260.9981197914892
1428. on	january 18 ernest gross conducted a press conference at the un	lasting an hour	1661.9129220187347
1429. here he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred	to his aberrant conduct	496.67694591656453
1430. this conference was held despite	stavropoulos' assurance to adolf berle who was leaving the same	day for puerto rico that nothing would be done until his return on	january 22 except that the secretary general would probably order	the list destroyed	6446.566118452887
1431. on january 24 paul bang-jensen accompanied	by adolf berle was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel	frank begley former police chief of farmington conn and now	head of un special police	3334.291142410657
1432. the four bundled in overcoats	mounted to the wind-swept roof of the un   there	begley lit a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen dropped four	sealed envelopes into the flames	5008.292855893199
1433. in one of these he said were notes	on the identities of the eighty-one refugees	1099.85428358
1434. the method of destroying	the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen	389.6194111283527
1435. he knew it would	be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence	1253.853613779186
1436. he was	right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier's	words on the subject well it seemed as good a place as any	to do the job	4845.400171790727
1437. the gross group had been formed for the express	purpose of advising the secretary general	1095.0460122974912
1438. hammarskjold's supposed	desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross	is illusion at best	2345.2252051666114
1439. gross's being outside the un	applied only to a physical state not an objective one	1111.5686188791644
1440. but by the	time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the	world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that paul	bang-jensen was not of sound mind	5150.838177020632
1441. shortly the group would issue	its report to the secretary general recommending paul bang-jensen's	dismissal from the united nations	1738.1707837473296
1442. the contents of this	195-page document would become known to many before it would become known	to the man it was written about	3473.1994630475574
1443. until this hungarian	committee matter came up bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual	939.6667070725925
1444. i had known him for some years when i was a delegate and before	and this manner had never been his	3056.3758033040567
1445. ernest a gross	leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general	dag hammarskjold had on december 41957 called him in as a	private lawyer to review bang-jensen's conduct relating to his	association with the special committee on the problem of hungary	4625.255797633899
1446. the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman	with the assistance of two un under secretaries constantin	stavropoulos and philippe de seynes	3920.0036030864203
1447. yes gross	went on bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man	373.4839478723646
1448. he had	always done well	22.287123827569733
1449. never well known but he had done his work competently	h	507.5595482740373
1450. gross had received marshall courteously and they	were discussing the case	743.6941947459925
1451. you know the lawyer said it's	difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back	1565.4585103434658
1452. gross was behind a clean-top desk only a manila folder before	him	966.5437226778273
1453. marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs	262.0026370562273
1454. outside the	office windows twenty-four stories above wall street a light rain	was falling	1407.9384362634378
1455. mr gross your report says that 'our	function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate	from or prejudice mr bang-jensen's rights as a staff member'	3108.1199447057666
1456. you know bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged	his case	749.8643764804576
1457. gross swung his swivel chair	14.86413468458613
1458. well	how could that have been	64.7845264297163
1459. i don't consider that he was prejudged	92.96672027984228
1460. we were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken	up by the disciplinary committee h	3247.0113643541163
1461. we have nothing	to hide under a bushel	166.2578656526175
1462. we did our job mr stavropoulos and mr	de seynes and myself taking evidence from a number of people	2604.65095874875
1463. what did you think about his mental state	168.3822739653493
1464. i	think our report sums up our finding gross answered	564.1273473088656
1465. don't	forget here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost	a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report h	2590.8304072680958
1466. this was not merely alleging errors but was carried out	by day-after-day allegations in memos written charges of serious consequence	h	3007.752106616993
1467. this is a distressing thing	14.866289163235432
1468. supposing you or	i were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level	best to carry on our work	3475.2170169836427
1469. no organization can carry on like that	94.04689144629047
1470. i've been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy	stories	about personnel difficulties so i know what a problem he was	3496.414301702693
1471. what i'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled	at your committee	944.1387998065277
1472. what do you mean	4.434275314929099
1473. for instance regarding the fact that the gross committee issued	two interim announcements to the press during its investigation	1724.5736799808972
1474. you	know bang-jensen was told the committee was 'to convey its views	suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general'	2578.705386503475
1475. in his	own words bang-jensen 'took it for granted that the group would	report to the secretary general privately and not in public'	2326.6953119648124
1476. he	claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial	to his position'	1403.6975815782394
1477. for an instant he	glared speechless at marshall	166.48707471584552
1478. i thought	the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end	1403.3074780759566
1479. but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in	the press	784.9731556213642
1480. it was getting so that we the committee were being tried	748.2316939615177
1481. you can find it in the papers	93.32145451439195
1482. well as a matter of	fact i've looked through back-issue files of new york papers for	december 1957 and haven't found a great deal-   gross	shot another look at marshall	4847.413563561624
1483. it wasn't necessarily all here	in new york	166.30014672376453
1484. don't forget the foreign press	22.156848585464424
1485. then	what about the second interim public announcement	167.21467788509614
1486. this cited bang-jensen's	'aberrant conduct'	22.068928288209865
1487. the reason for that	report was to settle the matter of the list	785.5670410096511
1488. as far as i'm concerned	it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen's	conduct	2365.4766115622147
1489. the january fifteen report recommended that	bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers- in the presence	of a un security officer	2328.458924747712
1490. how about your	press conference three days later- what was the reason for that	1395.4188787388796
1491. bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance	to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous	2027.2818610096706
1492. he claimed you made other slanderous allegations	140.68306682893567
1493. gross paused	and repeated himself	14.741210536985136
1494. the entire object of the press conference	was to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press were	querying the un about it	4102.3687636526665
1495. what was the list	2.9742754669158398
1496. i don't know	0.30041514999999996
1497. bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that	he had in his possession	1091.9802319926064
1498. it was foolish of him to keep	them whatever they were	745.8343644513533
1499. he could have been blackmailed or his family	might have been threatened	642.8672272445302
1500. of course the matter caught the public's	attention	251.76572203484002
1501. we attempted to conclude this and did so by having	the papers burned	786.9830447673994
1502. hammerskjold didn't like the way it was	carried out	387.35842117102703
1503. it was a sort of go^tterda^mmerung affair	94.16238707266655
1504. hammarskjold	believes the un is an organization that settles matters	in a procedural way h	1652.5545591608413
1505. if hammarskjold	had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner and if	bang-jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it	2315.210196705768
1506. mr	gross concerning the formation of your committee there's the	fact that you have been a legal adviser to the un in the past;	as i understand it mr hammarskjold wanted outside advice	5321.997378348098
1507. could you comment on that	14.767937576221161
1508. i've served as a counsel	for the un for some years specializing particularly in real	estate matters or other problems that the regular un legal	staff might not be equipped to handle	5180.815831880346
1509. mr stavropoulos is the un	legal chief and a very good man but he is not fully versed on	some technical points of american law	2604.8177388789186
1510. what did you think	about bang-jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the	hungarian report	1640.3350739877449
1511. marshall asked	0.20041515
1512. why mick shann went over and over the report with alsing	andersen trying to check them out	2117.433105744268
1513. even after the incident between	bang-jensen and shann in the delegates' lounge h and this	was not the way the chicago tribune presented it	2452.297518882412
1514. gross	reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings	744.5099372962642
1515. one	was an article on the un by alice widener from the cincinnati	enquirer	944.4903024170162
1516. the other was by chesly manley in the chicago	daily tribune	749.933018345902
1517. gross pointed to the manley story	43.71208007889295
1518. i	know ches he's a friend of mine	249.89925695127675
1519. he probably didn't mean to write	it this way or maybe he did	784.7038108468953
1520. there wasn't any 'violent argument'	between bang-jensen and shann as the tribune puts it	1408.569829503898
1521. that	implies that shann was on the enemy side	262.3113660720231
1522. you see what i mean	22.250996032930217
1523. how it's phrased there- the word 'violent'	94.07577813770024
1524. the	case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further	errors in the report	2357.29868000517
1525. 'i've found errors and i want you to	look them over'	503.09473289382214
1526. so once again shann had to argue with him about	this	757.007896087571
1527. but it wasn't a violent discussion	43.883926941067784
1528. and after all this shann	went over all that bang-jensen had brought up	1177.5406257788377
1529. own report peter marshall reflected describes the encounter as	gross stopped briefly then went on	1095.8778916019937
1530. shann was responsible	for the report	65.03210350952602
1531. he has felt terrible about all this	93.76556508135818
1532. it was a good	report he did all he could to make it a good report	1867.7510787783224
1533. when i speak	of how shann felt i know well	371.64689606615804
1534. don't forget i am an old member	of the club a former delegate	1188.0915932564276
1535. i think you are being unfair to take	these things up now	641.0131199184086
1536. you know this hits in many areas	140.39628116741454
1537. it	appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian	situation	934.8123502750113
1538. don't forget the un did no more than the united	states did h it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to	get the impact of this fact	4457.999893209765
1539. from the home	of his friend henrik kauffmann in washington dc paul	bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 1957 to ernest gross	2308.642724462984
1540. it said in part:   h the matters to be considered are	obviously of a grave character and i therefore respectfully request	that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make	adequate preparation	5937.693314477752
1541. ernest gross replied the next day	putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest	787.1116953609419
1542. this reveals some	misunderstanding on your part	140.13001584113093
1543. the group conducting the review is	not holding formal hearings	375.7328283986481
1544. it wished to pursue in the course of this	review questions arising from the body of material already in its	possession h	3272.6004143248474
1545. it sounded like a fair enough invitation	peter marshall reflected and bang-jensen must have thought so too	because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth	floor of the un	3658.5316070834647
1546. there ernest gross further assured him:	we were requested by the secretary general as i understand	it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant	and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee	in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat	8052.301800512821
1547. the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those	of common sense justice and fairness	1562.196785739041
1548. peter marshall	noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with	the gross group as unfortunate experiences and after his second	meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings	without legal counsel	5922.2284107263395
1549. marshall pondered the reason for this and	pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group	1571.0257551024972
1550. j a c robertson after serving gross one week left	for england	967.8013671410429
1551. fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged	261.09382165469117
1552. another week passed	and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage	755.4322571050069
1553. the sickness	was gone and after all the two young couples were on their honeymoon	1099.0522896056386
1554. the only lasting difficulty was the food	140.20605331341045
1555. in spite of pickering	dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals the	food did not seem the same as at home	2027.8627020247156
1556. everything tasted differently	from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at	home i loathed the most here ann noted	4084.3376602573653
1557. at last they concluded	that the heavy full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise	1561.5058111456387
1558. walking was the remedy they decided but a deck full of chicken	coops and pigpens was hardly suitable	2335.4590340564637
1559. a rope was found and like children in school the missionaries	skipped for hours at a time	1420.907124340709
1560. finally tiring of so monotonous a form	of exercise they decided to dance instead	1418.2826772932517
1561. it was much more fun reminding	the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics	room at bradford	1891.2430553051868
1562. the weather turned warmer and with it came better	appetites although harriet was still a little off-color	2116.1631493034984
1563. she could	not face coffee or tea without milk and was always craving types of	food that were not available aboard a sailing ship	2443.53788479743
1564. by now she was sure	she was going to have a baby deciding it would be born in india	or burma that november	3462.132824397074
1565. she was more excited than frightened at the	prospect of having her first child in a foreign land	1566.9202147794517
1566. the crew	of the caravan never failed to amaze ann who during her stay	in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language	3445.6315281062984
1567. she	wrote in her journal i have not heard the least profane language	since i have been on board the vessel	2023.7957406993664
1568. she was now enjoying the voyage very much	250.3072577249919
1569. even the first wave	of homesickness had passed although there were moments when captain	heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she	felt a little twinge at her heart	3530.5599684729737
1570. as for adoniram she found him	to be the kindest of husbands	958.9583273319083
1571. on sundays with the permission	of captain heard who usually attended with two of his officers	services were held in the double cabin	2308.1072741021258
1572. sometimes a ship would be	sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily	be seen on the distant deck	3274.9471522393133
1573. captain heard did not communicate with	any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united	states and britain	2014.8227952088546
1574. as warmer temperatures were encountered ann	and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt	water	2570.2469106486383
1575. when may came the caravan had already crossed	the equator	375.799708809879
1576. they were sailing round the cape of good hope; the	weather had turned wet and cold	1893.670818640614
1577. at this time harriet wrote in a letter	which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother:	i care not how soon we reach calcutta and are placed	in a still room with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread	4669.758596812985
1578. i	can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming oh what a luxury	1409.2692017676356
1579. i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel and	the almost intolerable smell after the rain that i have done little	more than lounge on the bed for several days	3649.9770806714214
1580. but i have been blest	with excellent spirits and to-day have been running about the deck	and dancing in our room for exercise as well as ever	4302.143555408739
1581. while studying at the seminary in andover adoniram had been working	on a new testament translation from the original greek	1889.75318065288
1582. he	had brought it along to continue during the voyage	558.874774716923
1583. there was one particular	word that troubled his conscience	260.41055820402073
1584. this was the greek word most	often translated as baptism	562.88137856603
1585. born a congregationalist	he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having	a few drops of water sprinkled on his head yet nowhere in the whole of	the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized	by sprinkling	4676.44659479353
1586. john the baptist used total immersion in the river	jordan for believers; even christ was baptized by this method	2579.4768256661505
1587. the more adoniram	looked at the greek word for baptism the more unhappy	he became over its true meaning	1735.5496081953952
1588. as was only natural he	confided his searchings to ann conceding ruefully that it certainly	looked as if their own	congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right	4300.924303560805
1589. by this time she had learned that	it was futile to argue with her young husband yet the uncomfortable	fact remained: the american congregationalists were sending them as	missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries	3941.0423701513128
1590. what would	happen if adoniram changed horses in midstream	392.7680996319789
1591. baptists and	congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms	370.63975429748217
1592. how embarrassing	it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries	should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist	teachings!   if you become a baptist i will not	ann informed her husband but sweeping her threat aside adoniram	continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he	found himself	7957.889359270365
1593. by early june they were a hundred miles off the	coast of ceylon by which time all four missionaries were hardened	seafarers	2155.1410790189148
1594. even harriet could boldly write i know not how it is;	but i hear the thunder roll; see the lightning flash; and the	waves threatening to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved	5495.268503236999
1595. ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two	strange tropical birds	949.8165061696267
1596. land was near and on june 12 one hundred	and fourteen days after leaving america they actually saw twenty miles	away the coast of orissa	3916.1884384787118
1597. captain heard gave orders for	the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain	the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters	3436.18183707421
1598. sometimes ships waited for days for such a man but captain	heard was lucky	1404.2822070413222
1599. next day a ship arrived with an english pilot	his leadsman an english youth and the first hindu the judsons and	newells had ever seen	2608.5815704737793
1600. a little man with a a dark copper color	skin he was wearing calico trousers and a white cotton short gown	3065.515078015444
1601. ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance	93.7295062130595
1602. he looks	as feminine as you can imagine she decided	568.3518888160804
1603. the pilot possessed	excellent skill at his calling; all day long the caravan	slowly made her way through the difficult passages	2029.2966628867566
1604. alas to ann's	consternation his language while thus employed left much to be desired	1393.2241468542868
1605. he swore so loudly at the top of his voice that she didn't get	any sleep all the next night	1876.5575274290927
1606. next morning the caravan was	out of the treacherous bay	558.9071658881505
1607. relieved of the major part of his responsibility	for the safety of the ship the pilot's oaths became fewer	1728.7334276964825
1608. slowly she moved up the hooghli river a mouth of the mighty ganges	toward calcutta	1652.4808614464898
1609. ann was entranced with the view as	were her husband and friends	642.6579647731567
1610. running across the deck which was empty	now that the livestock had been killed and eaten they sniffed the spice-laden	breezes that came from the shore each pointing out new and	exciting wonders to the other	5790.2528906555835
1611. out came the journal and in it	went ann's own description of the scene:   on each side	of the hoogli where we are now sailing are the hindoo cottages as	thick together as the houses in our seaports	4055.19782371731
1612. they are very small	and in the form of haystacks without either chimney or windows	1647.52561331049
1613. they	are situated in the midst of trees which hang over them and appear	truly romantick	1262.3970106969086
1614. the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green and	herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river and	the natives are scattered about differently employed	4820.792028442881
1615. some are fishing	some driving the team and many are sitting indolently on the banks	of the river	1575.1361910588048
1616. the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the	houses	749.2818863149994
1617. harriet was just as delighted	14.983396605494113
1618. where were the hardships	she had expected	141.40746741704396
1619. she was certain now that it would be no harder	to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home	in the big white house in haverhill	3095.5862028805313
1620. with childlike innocence she wrote	of the indians as walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands	with the tawny children around them h	3702.481303735519
1621. this is the most delightful	trial i have ever had she decided	642.981088867566
1622. the indians	who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly	even if she was suitably shocked according to the customs of the society	in which she had been reared to find them naked except a piece	of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle	7129.047542333066
1623. at last they	saw calcutta largest city of bengal and the caravan's destination	788.3098160815387
1624. founded august 24 1690 by job charnock of the east india	company and commonly called the city of palaces it seemed	a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson	4813.02211921749
1625. solid brick	buildings painted dazzling white large domes and tall picturesque palms	stretched as far as the eye could see while the wharves and harbor	were filled with tall-masted sailing ships	3346.0263561588276
1626. crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their	strange-sounding bengali tongue	1189.3525986169307
1627. harriet's mouth watered	with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last	to her much-craved milk and fresh bread	2178.600463552163
1628. ann pleased to see her friend	happy was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard	had sent on board for their enjoyment	3903.6433822537465
1629. cautiously she sampled her first	pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of a	rich pear	1720.2706955108636
1630. though she did not then know its name this strange new	fruit was a banana	1639.11194728972
1631. the first act of adoniram and samuel	on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station a necessity	when landing in east india company territory	2727.957283339543
1632. on the way they	tried to discover all they could about burma and they were disturbed	to find that michael symes's book had not presented an altogether	true picture	4625.695349693087
1633. he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really	treating him as the important visitor he considered himself	1870.4479091278924
1634. they	were in fact quietly laughing at him for their king wished to have	nothing to do with the western world	3047.1314497674325
1635. when captain john gibault	of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship the astra had been	promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river	2970.531673272701
1636. although after much trouble he did manage to get it back he discovered	there was no trade to be had	2804.423656354171
1637. all captain gibault took back	to salem were a few items for the town's east india museum	1402.7179983765225
1638. a	year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum	lacquer which nobody wanted to buy	2811.8223966262112
1639. after that salem ships decided	to bypass unfriendly burma	260.79575037410166
1640. the burmese appeared to have little	knowledge of british power or any idea of trade	1635.625381316719
1641. cruel burmese governors could on the slightest whim take	a man's life	645.9333996907578
1642. as for missionaries even if they succeeded in getting	into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the	christian faith to the burmans	4079.7155057520104
1643. unspeakable tortures or even execution	might well be their fate	374.89464881087827
1644. go back to america or any	other place well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them	but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads	4082.94506623279
1645. somewhat	daunted the two american missionaries reached the police station	where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk	1722.9359661718458
1646. when he discovered	they had received from the company's court of directors	no permission to live in india coupled with the fact that they were	americans who had been sent to asia to convert the heathen he	became more belligerent than ever	6541.71751852593
1647. they explained that they	desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could	be found	1869.802268562667
1648. she describes first the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by	this unseasonable exultation; he is answered by a confused	honest englishman	3282.083488224305
1649. the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are	found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government	their delight at the prospect of a new war their hopes of having the	tories hanged and so on	4217.072593054938
1650. as for the author of the englishman	mrs manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the	protestant cause should be left to ridpath dick steele and	their associates with the apostles of young man's coffee-house	5775.20381298335
1651. another controversy typical of the war between the	englishman and the examiner centered on robert	molesworth a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish	privy council	3124.633781540039
1652. on december 21 the day that the irish house	of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps their	tory lord chancellor molesworth reportedly made this remark on the	defense of phipps by convocation: they that have turned the	world upside down are come hither also	7044.587878820035
1653. upon complaints from the	lower house of convocation to the house of lords he was removed	from the privy council his remark having been represented as a blasphemous	affront to the clergy	3455.759054707777
1654. steele who had earlier praised molesworth	in tatler no 189 now defended him in englishman	no 46 depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution	4109.010461383295
1655. on	the other hand molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press	639.8967112157359
1656. swift in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum's	introduction indicated his feelings by including molesworth	along with toland tindal and collins in the group of those	who like burnet are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy	6668.517876170496
1657. in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter	to archbishop king and he had earlier described him as the worst	of them in some observations on the irish privy council	submitted to oxford	3977.557819800032
1658. a month later in the publick spirit of	the whigs he used steele's defense of molesworth as evidence of	his disrespect for the clergy calling steele's position an affront	to the whole convocation of ireland	5628.263944537068
1659. on this issue then	as on so many in these months steele and swift took rigidly opposed	points of view	1879.5463409802112
1660. in the early months of 1714 the battle	between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its	major phase	3254.6558547982413
1661. the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele's	crisis on january 19 and from that point on the fight proceeded	at a rapid pace	2450.916727594791
1662. in answer to the crisis swift produced	the publick spirit of the whigs his most extensive and bitter	attack on his old friend	3485.4082684660557
1663. by this time as we shall see the tories	were already planning to punish steele for his political writing	by expelling him from the house of commons	2853.3555485987863
1664. despite his defense	of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech	before the house their efforts were successful	3481.4641434192586
1665. steele lost his	seat in parliament and his personal quarrel with swift by now a public	issue thus reached its climax	2028.869201157943
1666. of all the whig tracts	written in support of the succession the crisis is perhaps the	most significant	2368.273170679901
1667. certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate	167.48188668976584
1668. hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation said to have reached	40000 and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other	government writers the work must have had considerable impact	5173.014597288396
1669. steele's	main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate	danger of a stuart restoration	1429.6467288260476
1670. to this end the first and longest	section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution	to defend england against the arbitrary power of a popish prince	4825.7509023411485
1671. in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes	of current whig propaganda ranging from a criticism of the tory	peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough; but his principal	theme is that the intrigues of the tories our popish or jacobite	party pose an immediate threat to church and state	5319.840023360605
1672. like	burnet he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the	crisis	1651.4427791812063
1673. treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession	he complains are allowed to pass unnoticed	945.2265947026593
1674. in this connection swift	too is drawn in for attack: the author of the conduct of	the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession	4285.498794436136
1675. in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy steele	goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected	in the event of a stuart restoration and with rousing rhetoric he	asserts that the only preservation from these terrours is to	be	found in the laws he has so tediously cited	5385.9501357939935
1676. it is no time he	writes to talk with hints and innuendos but openly and honestly	to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put	their designs in execution against us	5321.343515980018
1677. steele apparently	professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his	own good since the government was soon to use it as evidence against	him in his trial before the house	3654.0981397950222
1678. in the final issues of the englishman	which ended just as the new session of parliament began	he provided his enemies with still more ammunition	3902.4765254088757
1679. for example no	56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke	of cambridge	1410.7566960016957
1680. in a few months the duke was to be the center of	a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant	succession	3894.1792446962854
1681. at the order of the dowager electress the hanoverian	agents supported by the whig leaders demanded that a writ	of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in	parliament thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian	prince in england before the queen's death	4963.6483357041025
1682. anne was	furious and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused	752.4988663826823
1683. oxford	realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ took the opposite	view for which the queen never forgave him	2181.6376604833868
1684. accordingly the	request was granted but the elector himself who had not been consulted	by his mother rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schu^tz	whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian	interest to suffer and had made oxford's dismissal more likely	than ever	7141.910810573247
1685. steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a	plan	647.3865288400955
1686. a few days after this englishman appeared defoe reported	to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the	duke be called over; defoe then commented if they could draw	that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves	quickly for they are not asham'd to say they want onely a head	to make a beginning	8179.016668416984
1687. the final issue of the englishman	no 57 for february 15 ran to some length and was printed	as a separate pamphlet entitled the englishman: being the close	of the paper so-called	3473.2613313035145
1688. steele's purpose is to present a general	defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which	had occupied him in the englishman; but there is much here also	which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift	6315.341597167453
1689. thus he complains	with considerable justice that the tory writers have resorted	to libel instead of answering his arguments	1713.0845748895913
1690. his birth education	and fortune he says have all been ridiculed simply because he has	spoken with the freedom of an englishman and he assures the reader that	whoever talks with me is speaking to a gentleman born	6069.868546612035
1691. as	notable examples of this abuse he quotes passages from the examiner	that destroyer of all things and the character of richard	steele which he here attributes to swift	3095.681736510024
1692. though put in rather	maudlin terms steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis	1407.2185197374667
1693. his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal	satire despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right	to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of	the sovereign	3962.503303854468
1694. he claims too that his political convictions are simply	those which are called revolution principles and which are	accepted by moderate men in both parties	3877.0065733109705
1695. the final section	of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele's	relations with swift	1567.9329117075056
1696. it purports to be a letter from steele to	a friend at court who in miss blanchard's opinion could only be	meant as swift	3686.98196059422
1697. steele first answers briefly the charges which his	dear old friend has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and	his	crisis	2040.8789850713583
1698. then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers	whom he calls the new converts; by this term he means to ridicule	their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite	their own education and manner of life- a gibe in other words	at the presbyterianism in harley's family and at bolingbroke's	reputed impiety	8052.5247321317265
1699. the tory leaders he insinuates are cynically	using the church as a political by-word to increase party friction	and keep themselves in power	2326.0023687190933
1700. this is the principal point made	in this final section of englishman no 57 and it caps steele's	efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the	notion of the tories as a church party supported by the body	of the clergy	6799.897727993346
1701. next steele turns his attention to the courtier	he is addressing	503.21586008671557
1702. he explains that there are sometimes honorable	courtiers but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not	hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice	and ambition	5330.329093146127
1703. such he implies is the case with his friend who is not	really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts	2457.7457192038037
1704. if jack the courtier is really to be taken as swift the following	remark is obviously steele's comment on swift's change of	parties and its effect on their friendship: i assure you dear	jack when i first found out such an allay in you as makes you	of so malleable a constitution that you may be worked into any form	an artificer pleases i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much	longer	0.30166232349522504
1705. he closes his letter by demanding that dunkirk	be demolished that the pretender be forced to move farther away from	the coast of england and that the queen and the house of hanover	come to a better understanding	4034.6530210560595
1706. the last point was soon to be included	in the seditious remarks used against him in parliament	2114.353414903072
1707. the examiner during steele's trial a month later printed	an answer from the courtier addressed to r s at	button's coffee-house	2034.2420471335445
1708. he reviews steele's entrance into politics	and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing	to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly	should be credited to the indulgence of his friends	6077.780462366114
1709. once more	in other words steele is said to be indebted to swift for his wit;	this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared	in the tory press especially the examiner	3751.8909263556952
1710. in the publick	spirit of the whigs it may be noted swift himself contemptuously	dismissed steele's reference to his friend at court: i	suppose by the style of old friend and the like it must be some	body there of his own level; among whom his party have indeed	more friends than i could wish	7851.0348166522135
1711. on february 16	steele took his seat in parliament	259.1351759073063
1712. by now he was undergoing a fresh	torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets and action was being	taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament	4473.450878623278
1713. on the	very day that the parliamentary session began another infamous	libel appeared entitled a letter from the facetious dr	andrew tripe at bath to the venerable nestor ironside	3106.678328734201
1714. it is	filled with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of his physical	appearance; in the opening paragraph too steele is accused	of extreme egotism of giving himself the preference to all the learned	his contemporaries from dr sw-ft himself even down to	poet cr-spe of the customhouse	7306.014220883891
1715. when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 it	was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer begun some	years before	2717.170229364146
1716. the film they did after his return was an inconsequential	bit of nothing titled out of this world a satire on the sinatra	bobby-soxer craze	3868.5072709287515
1717. the twist lay in using bing crosby's voice	on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the	words	1888.2454301419561
1718. if nothing else at least two good songs came out of the project	out of this world and june comes around every year	3479.1931048763254
1719. though they would produce some very memorable and lasting	songs arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on	2036.3542221316482
1720. their first collaboration came close	22.393978483027443
1721. early in 1941 they were assigned	to a script titled hot nocturne	641.8488472893606
1722. it purported to be a reasonably	serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians their aims their	problems- the tug-of-war between the pure and the commercial-	and seemed a promising vehicle for the two men shared a	common interest in jazz	6459.234244233032
1723. johnny mercer practically grew up with	the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears	1259.9521098516122
1724. he was born in savannah	georgia in 1909	251.59440469630005
1725. his father george a mercer was descended	from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back	to one hugh mercer who had emigrated from scotland in 1747	3119.108222863856
1726. the lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into	real estate	1183.653659286178
1727. his second wife lillian was the mother of john h	mercer	501.5461172579421
1728. by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the	call	1177.9172268113184
1729. one day he followed the irish jasper greens the town band	to a picnic and spent the entire day listening while his family spent	the day looking	2871.881392862249
1730. the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time	maid to keeping an eye on the boy	2115.09417146971
1731. but one afternoon mrs	mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the mercer home	1414.3482876791754
1732. the mother inquired where's johnny and why did you leave him	749.4076888819731
1733. there was nothing else i could do the maid answered	satisfied with a rather vague explanation	1263.9776714212335
1734. but mrs mercer demanded	more	22.24741018176047
1735. the maid then told her because he fired me	258.8173129753652
1736. with	her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little	else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited	until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with	the trumpet	6430.370379328173
1737. young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for	both instruments	504.4377174119569
1738. still he did like music making and even sang in	the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school near orange virginia	where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well	5001.784600692939
1739. when he was fifteen john h mercer turned out his first song a	jazzy little thing he called sister susie strut your	stuff	2334.2418637788132
1740. if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have	been mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with	a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect	4984.641433108804
1741. from his playmates in savannah	mercer had picked up along with a soft southern dialect traces	also of the gullah dialects of africa	2332.221325851158
1742. such speech differences	made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language	1412.3938273505219
1743. during the summers while he was still in school mercer worked	for his father's firm as a messenger boy	1724.1956301545438
1744. it generally took well	into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help	1896.4982816302122
1745. we'd	give him things to deliver letters checks deeds and things	like that remembers his half-brother walter still in the real estate	business in savannah and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly	stuffed them into his pocket	3959.1660344661514
1746. this rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed	to be the dominant trait in mercer's personality ever since	2581.5297415978816
1747. it	is however a disarming disguise or perhaps a shield for not only has	mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the	years but also one who can function remarkably under pressure	3965.216449630301
1748. he	has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer	and is a sharp businessman	1664.0487249530674
1749. he has also	an extraordinary conscience	43.3481671521269
1750. in 1927 his father's business collapsed	and rather than go bankrupt mercer senior turned his firm over	to a bank for liquidation	3285.6558080575605
1751. he died before he could completely pay off	his debts	375.61796429646955
1752. some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation	received a check for $300000 enough to clear up the debt	2827.2146609607303
1753. the check	had been mailed from chicago the envelope bore no return address	and the check was not signed	1724.37052648108
1754. that's johnny sighed	the bank president the best-hearted boy in the world but absent-minded	1414.3191300261433
1755. but mercer's explanation was simple: i made out	the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case i lost	it	2303.0176814113024
1756. when he remembered that he might have not signed the check	mercer made out another for the same amount instructing the bank to	destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly	signed both of them	6039.950599264046
1757. when the family business failed mercer	left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he	would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group	3106.348163915708
1758. when	the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition-	and won- mercer instead of returning with the rest of	the company in triumph remained in new york	4984.2311375260415
1759. he had talked one other	member of the group to stay with him but that friend had tired of	not eating regularly and returned to savannah	2720.334105628956
1760. but mercer hung on	living after a fashion in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up	1423.7419279546418
1761. the place had no sink or washbasin only a bathtub his mother	discovered when she visited him	1414.3428007998475
1762. johnny insisted on cooking a	chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and i'll	never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub	4292.4356476990415
1763. a story	no doubt apocryphal for mercer himself denies it has him sporting	a monacle in those village days	1720.6752537227687
1764. though merely clear glass it	was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint	himself upon the memories of producers	3657.159196184959
1765. one day in a bar so the legend	goes someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle	and broke it	2473.575965604215
1766. the innocent malfeasant filled with that supreme sense	of honor found in bars insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle-	and did over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle	5154.373974103668
1767. mercer is supposed to have refused it with anyone who wears	a square monacle must be affected!   everett miller then	assistant director for the garrick gaieties a theatre guild	production needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just	happened not to need any actor at the moment however	5026.986564677722
1768. for him mercer	produced the lyric to out of breath scared to death of you	introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties by sterling	holloway	4254.446792239958
1769. this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke	and ira gershwin by e y harburg and duke and by harry	myers	2455.6713330016964
1770. entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged	the burgeoning song writer to take a wife elizabeth meehan a dancer	in the gaieties	3506.6318238737854
1771. the mercers took up residence in brooklyn	and mercer found a regular job in wall street misplacing stocks	and bonds	1877.7806210368537
1772. when he heard that paul whiteman was looking	for singers to replace the rhythm boys mercer applied and got the	job not for my voice i'm sure but because i could write songs	and material generally	5773.445387709931
1773. while with the whiteman band mercer met	jerry arlen	262.2327387606456
1774. he had yet to meet harold arlen for although they	had collaborated on satan's li'l lamb mercer and	harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them	4858.6081822555025
1775. the lyric mercer remembers was tailored to fit the unusual melody	503.20721262160487
1776. mercer's whiteman association brought him into contact	with	hoagy carmichael whose snowball mercer relyriced as lazybones	in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning	of mercer's song-writing career	5198.150306277417
1777. after leaving whiteman mercer	joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist	643.2137629622698
1778. with the help of ziggy	elman also in the band he transformed a traditional jewish melody	into a popular song and the angels sing	3699.0746579218476
1779. the countrywide	success of lazybones and and the angels sing could only	lead to hollywood where besides harold arlen mercer collaborated	with harry warren jimmy van heusen richard whiting walter	donaldson jerome kern and arthur schwartz	3874.0936755392913
1780. mercer has also	written both music and lyrics for several songs	753.2731639670835
1781. he may be the only	song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u s	treasury; he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin	who was secretary of the treasury 1932-33	3763.973378747305
1782. when johnny	mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 mercer	like arlen had several substantial film songs to his credit among	them hooray for hollywood ride tenderfoot ride	have you got any castles baby	5794.927388478889
1783. and too marvelous	for words; with harry warren he	did the girl friend of the whirling dervish jeepers creepers	and you must have been a beautiful baby	2862.824825378953
1784. mercer's	lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances	a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair	3482.4540090566197
1785. though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with	the best of them mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit	2320.770236244646
1786. his casual dreamlike working methods often as not in absentia	were an abrupt change from harburg's so that arlen had	to adjust again to another approach to collaboration	4466.793212934621
1787. there were times	that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously	373.2922151393051
1788. speaking	of his work with johnny mercer arlen says our working habits	were strange	1404.6463491130485
1789. after we got a script and the spots for the songs were	blocked out we'd get together for an hour or so every day	2462.3343507397385
1790. while johnny	made himself comfortable on the couch i'd play the tunes for	him	1412.2848119082405
1791. he has a wonderfully retentive memory	43.74564520387176
1792. after i would finish	playing the songs he'd just go away without a comment	1418.345399616073
1793. i wouldn't	hear from him for a couple of weeks then he'd come around with the	completed lyric	1571.4871169806127
1794. arlen is one of the few	composer mercer has been able to work with so closely for they held	their meetings in arlen's study	3679.1574020655994
1795. some guys bothered me	mercer has said	93.46736874531986
1796. i couldn't write with them in the same room with	me but i could with harold	1879.167198685202
1797. he is probably our most original composer;	he often uses very odd rhythms which makes it difficult and	challenging for the lyric writer	2323.203761727384
1798. while arlen and mercer	collaborated on hot nocturne mercer worked also with arthur	schwartz on another film navy blues	2602.545710763723
1799. arlen too worked on	other projects at the same time with old friend ted koehler	1092.7286304850604
1800. besides	doing a single song when the sun comes out they worked on	the ambitious americanegro suite for voices and piano as well	as songs for films	4282.91914367838
1801. the americanegro suite is in a sense	an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection	of negro songs not for a night club but for the concert stage	3571.8273194585176
1802. the	work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which	koehler set the words there'll be no more work there'll	be no	more worry matching the spiritual feeling of the jot	5649.891635674343
1803. this grew	into the song big time comin'	167.90467672165752
1804. by september 1940 the suite	had developed into a collection of six songs four spirituals a	dream and a lullaby	2832.898562292151
1805. the negro composer hall johnson studied	the americanegro suite and said of it of all the many	songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid	idiom in both words and music these six songs by harold arlen	and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest	5061.674456114098
1806. thoroughly	modern in treatment they are at the same time full of simple sincerity	which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by	no means to be confused with the average 'broadway spirituals'	which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'amen	corner' 'judgement day' 'gabriel's horn' and a	frustrated devil- with a few random 'hallelujahs' thrown in for	good measure	8552.378836512124
1807. i feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole	93.71841942511941
1808. it had a single porcelain	stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards	1890.099976607973
1809. it was	here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role	during the children's party	1249.0964790196672
1810. a much larger room adjacent to the	lavatory served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet	2382.1168078757523
1811. that	unused room was large enough for- well say an elephant could get	into it h and as a matter of fact an elephant did h   something	occurred on the morning of the children's party which may	illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused	us	4809.262195266619
1812. it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the	hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he would be back	in	an hour or two to continue his convalescence	5348.9427720172
1813. arthur robinson traveled	with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the american	791.914412770575
1814. he was ghost writer for babe ruth whose main talent for literary	composition was the signing of his autograph	2590.606397674355
1815. robbie was a war veteran	with battle-shattered knees	166.94266655822872
1816. he arrived on crutches at the	newspaper club with one of his great pals oliver herford artist	author and foe of stupidity	3275.909068081289
1817. mr herford's appearance was that	of a frustrated gnome	260.97756950286737
1818. he seemed timid wore nose glasses	from which a black ribbon dangled and was no bigger than a jockey	2608.1707697053134

1828. mr herford	touched the fat man's arm	141.49254664377116

1837. mr hearst's telegraphic code word for victor	watson was fatboy	376.61522360417655
1838. the staff saw in him the qualities of a	don cossack hence as mentioned before his nickname the hetman	2588.182557917421
1839. the hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage	rider of the steppes	934.4462234235536
1840. indeed he looked more like a well-fleshed	lay brother of the hospice of st bernard	1647.6143944849923
1841. nor were his manners	barbaric	14.938673155637375
1842. he had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features	which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the	bodies were buried	3900.4719086213177

1849. he also disliked	runyon for no good reason other than the fact that the demon's	talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman's say-so	or his supervision	3340.1302234903546
1850. runyon for his part had a contemptuous	regard for mr watson	757.7572790881371

1856. why'	0.30041514999999996
1857. about the only time the hetman seemed excited	was	when one of his own pet ideas was born	1570.2539690891367
1858. then he would get to his feet	as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers and say almost	invariably gentlemen this is an amazing story! it's bigger	than the armistice	5169.447130661383
1859. some of the hetman's ideas	were dream-ridden vaguely imparted and at times preposterous	783.4320367321192
1860. one	day he assigned me to lay bare a plot by the duponts to supply	munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur	in cuba	4649.924606540622
1861. he said that his information was so secret that he would	not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip	2453.1842748311656
1862. i	can tell you this much he said	249.68834358119108
1863. it's bigger than the armistice	14.986496132623211
1864. i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment	and consulted several of my own well-informed sources	2371.0838199327545
1865. then i spent	the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle's pool	parlors	1413.2906971754521
1866. when i returned to make my report the hetman did not remember	having sent me on the secret mission	2574.162289792149
1867. he was busy he said in	having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation	789.7274475545697
1868. and i was to go	to work on that odd matter	752.5012722916204
1869. i shall tell of it later on	92.71847906173714
1870. the	hetman had a strong liking for a story any story which was to be had	by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods	3865.0729754566337
1871. most of my stories	were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me	the facts and not as a rule by playing clever tricks	2862.9556492833094
1872. one day	i tired of following the hetman's advice of shadowing and	of the ring-around-the-rosie approach to a report that enrico caruso	had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the central park monkey	house	5449.800553806085
1873. i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and	to bugs baer	945.9206781074963
1874. mr baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and	spirit-gum from an actor at the friars	1902.296184522871
1875. we fashioned beards put	them on and reported to the hetman at the city desk	1100.6132555180848
1876. mr	baer had an auburn beard like longfellow's	250.38454170530866
1877. mr mccay had on	a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache	645.8368700999164
1878. as for myself i	had on an enormous black muff	565.6391099146525
1879. this together with a derby hat	and horn-rim eyeglasses gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist	1416.434595409118
1880. we are ready for your next mysterious assignment said	mr baer to the hetman	1405.8079367839625
1881. where to sir	0.20041515
1882. mr watson	did not have much humor in his make-up but he managed a mirthless	smile	1889.8980392803223
1883. just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give	the rewrite desk an account of a murder	1732.3925886959732
1884. the hetman told me to take	the story over the phone and to write it	1639.5416378102232
1885. while i was sitting at one	of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard arthur	brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand	2986.5684048048793
1886. he paused	for a moment to look at me then went on to the city desk to deliver	his today column	3029.819203020195
1887. i thought it expedient to take off my	derby my glasses and the beard; and also to change telephones	1727.7920462723691
1888. i	managed to do this by the time the great ab returned to the place	where he last had seen the fierce nihilist	3492.7980421629973
1889. he stood there staring	with disbelief at the vacant desk	374.0440988337377
1890. then he wrinkled his huge brow	and went slowly out of the room	1182.130377147316
1891. he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression	43.187139414130584
1892. he had been seeing things	22.118857101810008
1893. the hetman's	ideas	for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless	or lacking in merit	1731.750977514368
1894. he campaigned successfully for the riddance	of death avenue and also brought about the ending of pollution	of metropolitan beaches by sewage	3267.9176871195696
1895. he exposed the bucket-shop racket	with the able assistance of two excellent reporters nat ferber	and carl helm	1573.370413293586
1896. in the conduct of these and many other campaigns the	hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed	3272.7837880961533
1897. it seems to me now in a long backward glance that many of	the hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture	when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr hearst- were	keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day	4752.127097225444
1898. alone	rejected on every hand divorced and in financial trouble he leaped	from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937	3277.392966287127
1899. one	finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited	for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol wr	hearst	2725.5764890560167
1900. that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure	of his despair	1643.0937165983119
1901. the unfinished note written in pencil upon the back	of a used envelope and addressed to the coroner makes one wonder	about many things: god forgive me for everything	3112.0054539914327
1902. i cannot	h   much to damon runyon's amazement as well as my own	i got along splendidly with the hetman; that is until i became	an editor hence in his eyes a rival	5336.15867310517
1903. not long after colonel van	hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise	and a contract on the hetman's recommendation	2620.7416097984487
1904. during the next years	he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the	hearst service	2821.797739024386
1905. it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to	have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists	2174.710544102092
1906. i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement	746.0451067687784
1907. somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he	otherwise might have because his foe colonel van hamm wouldn't	touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil	3094.5283281455795
1908. i remember one day when	mr hearst sent the	hetman a telegram: please find some more reporters like that	young man from denver	3494.394986854838
1909. watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm	164.8860460704021
1910. the colonel grunted then made a remark which might be construed	in either of two ways	1878.2259247617135
1911. don't bother to look any further	43.618689496467105
1912. we already	have the only one of its kind	392.7751863123909
1913. the hetman did have	friends but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession	786.7971992403321
1914. sergeant	mike donaldson congressional medal of honor soldier was	one of them	952.278914552503
1915. dr menas s gregory was another	43.271052926894505
1916. i used to go	with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment to sit	among the doctor's excellent collection of statues paintings and	books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and	become almost affable	6442.5670095431105
1917. there was one time however when his	face clouded and he suddenly blurted why did my brother commit	suicide	1715.6261530897639
1918. i cannot remember dr gregory's reply if	indeed he made one	758.0089807016008
1919. if she were not at home mama would see to it that a fresh white rose	was there	1568.5813879856082
1920. sometimes mrs coolidge would close herself in the	green suite on the second floor and play the piano she had brought	to the white house	3907.2173695021133
1921. mama knew she was playing her son's favorite	pieces and feeling close to him and did not disturb her	1729.5085279498496
1922. all	the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic	loss even though the president tried harder than ever to make his	little dry jokes and to tease the people around him	6070.686402039488
1923. a little	boy came to give the president his personal condolences and the president	gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be	shown in	3214.4024137467354
1924. backstairs the maids cried a little over that and the standing	invitation was not mentioned to mrs coolidge	2359.480728248306
1925. the	president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been	before the tragedy	1427.04161474827
1926. he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents	to coax a smile to her lips	2107.5189539345984
1927. dresses	were short in the days of mrs coolidge and spanish shawls	were thrown over them	1254.317784048949
1928. he got her dozens of them	64.40278073512567
1929. one shawl was so	tremendous that she could not wear it so she draped it over the banister	on the second floor and it hung over the stairway	2991.482069606201
1930. the president	used to look at it with a ghost of a smile	1184.356122444464

1932. she kept	the dolls on the lincoln bed	252.31950231147553
1933. at night when mama would turn back the	covers she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place	them elsewhere for the night	2879.344738111534
1934. mama always felt that the collection symbolized	mrs coolidge's wish for a little girl	1416.0900331079229
1935. among the	dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady who would pick	it up and look at it often	2315.12868671446
1936. it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist	386.8474498705212
1937. an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope	was a name for mrs coolidge's first granddaughter	1411.834658207335

1942. mrs coolidge would knit and the president would sit reading	or playing with the many pets around them	2375.751837703655
1943. now and then the	president would call for little jack master of the hounds	which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house	since teddy roosevelt's administration and discuss the welfare	of some one of the animals	4395.807688773342
1944. it was part of little jack's work	to look after the dogs	965.8695793660975

1946. that was rob roy who posed with mrs coolidge	for the portrait by howard chandler christy	1877.8355045103494
1947. to get him to pose	mrs coolidge would feed him candy so he enjoyed the portrait sessions	as well as she did	2189.5490580462097
1948. i would like to straighten out a misconception	about the dress mrs coolidge is wearing in this painting	2361.8605141259877
1949. it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian	1099.9094085441036
1950. people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist	much later on	1634.5800703180262

1953. mrs coolidge	gave mama this dress for me and i wore it many times	936.5944819950737
1954. i still have	the dress and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution	as a memento or as i more fondly hope to present it to a museum containing	articles showing the daily lives of the presidents- if i	can get it organized	6927.849075725111
1955. but to get back to the coolidge household	mrs coolidge so obviously loved dogs that the public sent her	more dogs- calamity jane timmy and blackberry	2754.8168571795572
1956. the last two	were a red and a black chow	562.6996413750812
1957. rob roy remained boss of all the dogs	166.93383346117668

1959. the dogs would run	through the halls after him like a burst of bullets and all the maids	would run for cover	2190.1104843341454
1960. mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell	on rob roy or not- since she had the ear of mrs coolidge	more than the other maids	4284.683745281564
1961. but she was afraid the first lady would	not understand because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first	family	2044.8266679741766
1962. every day when the president took his nap rob roy	would stretch out on the window seat near him like a perfect gentleman	and stare thoughtfully out the window or he would take a little	nap himself	5934.997013369692
1963. he would not make a sound until the president had wakened	and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know	the coast was clear	2988.8566733483817
1964. his signal was for the other dogs to come running	but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch	out	3877.2198881709155
1965. rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to	his office every morning	789.3023157660898
1966. rob roy was well aware of the importance	of this mission and he would walk in front of the president looking	neither to the right nor to the left	4663.867051532301
1967. at dinner lunch or breakfast	the president would call out supper!- he called	all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal	2326.335102917783
1968. all the	dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to	the dining room	2611.836058065283
1969. they would all lie around on the rug during the meal	a very pretty sight as rob roy prudence and calamity jane were	all snow-white	2598.8441813071668
1970. when prudence and blackberry were too young	to be trusted in the dining room they were tied to the radiator with	their leashes and they would cry	4282.153577527753
1971. mama tried to talk to them and keep	them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first	family returned	2174.578791917553
1972. finally mama did mention to mrs coolidge	that she felt sorry for the little dogs and then mrs coolidge	decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone even though	her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity	6413.073978039172
1973. mama was	now the first maid to mrs coolidge because catherine the previous	first maid had become ill and died	1882.0525069595024

1978. they	seemed to be at the white house half the time	752.3354943232409
1979. the butlers were	amused because when the stearns were there the president would say	grace at breakfast	1414.3478528077414
1980. if the stearns were not there grace would be omitted	559.6115289429301
1981. speaking of breakfast the president inaugurated a new	custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table	1412.465645014082
1982. the word	was that this too was part of an economy move on his part	1637.9006132561838
1983. a new bill	had been passed under harding that designated the government rather	than the president as the tab-lifter for official meals	2183.3198512862336
1984. so the	president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government	officials to attend	1661.6139447590074
1985. he caused a lot of talk when he also	chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair	while he ate	2736.557492569492
1986. mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful	mr coolidge certainly made a good president	2126.247460395888
1987. he knew exactly	how to be colorful!   the favorite guest of the house as	far as the staff was concerned was mr wrigley the chewing gum king	2866.9364709747247
1988. the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more and	every christmas mr wrigley sent the president a check for $100	to be divided among all the help	5013.128913513063
1989. you can imagine that he got pretty	good service	261.5393670246274
1990. another good friend of the coolidges' was	george b harvey who was the ambassador to great britain from	1921 to 1923	3044.8378996063493
1991. he had been a friend of the hardings and continued	to be invited by the coolidges	1262.4785241438524
1992. the first royalty whom mama	ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania	who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 1926	4969.874164906946
1993. she was not an overnight guest in the white house but mr ike	hoover the chief usher had mama check her fur coat when she came	in and take care of her needs	3551.560987679312
1994. mama said she was one of the prettiest	ladies she had ever seen	1188.691596042772
1995. mama was very patriotic and one of	the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that	flew above the white house	2719.691479430096
1996. actually two flags were used at the	mansion- a small one on rainy days and a big one on bright days	3060.317241163034
1997. the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind	and mama would mend it	1580.411207816823
1998. she would often go up on the roof to see	the attendant take down the flag in the evening	2603.4631603587104
1999. she used to tell me	when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that	way i have the wonderful safe feeling that americans are protected	no matter which way the wind blows	3937.1461854535764
2000. even when mrs	coolidge was in mourning for her son she reached out to help other people	in trouble	2559.607542941977
2001. one person she helped was my brother	92.90474121371885
2002. mama had told	her how emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the	war	2103.9247844464576
2003. he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number	of times	1083.8594857385597
2004. taking a personal interest she had the doctor	assigned to the white house dr james coupal look emmett over	2611.364359455059
2005. as a result he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health	improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the	government service	3101.0349169859014
2006. but again there was danger that his lungs would	suffer in the muggy washington weather and he had to return to the	dry climate of the west to live and work	5024.924031689558
2007. when mrs coolidge	was in mourning she did not wear black	496.9018913051733
2008. she wore grey every day	and white every evening	395.7017993017432
2009. mama knew that she was out of mourning when	she finally wore bright colors	939.0045749902416
2010. the president helped her a lot by selecting	some lovely colored dresses to get her started	1877.8565474987925
2011. she opened the	boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face	1418.2900148393533
2012. on	the social side the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the	white house thrilled her the most	2832.7554029284556
2013. it was her job to stand at the	foot of the stairs and just as the first lady stepped off the last	tread mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to	the blue room to greet her guests with the president	4537.651171080257
2014. mama would	enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone and would note	a gown here and there to tell me about that night	4302.2513311930325
2015. one night	mama came home practically in a state of shock	504.8966195512543
2016. she had stood at the	bottom of the stairs as usual when mrs coolidge came down in	the same dress that is now in the smithsonian to greet her guests	4831.177675017517
2017. mama stooped down to fix the train but there was no train there! she	reached and reached around the dress but there was nothing there	2571.0101502045177
2018. she looked up and saw that without knowing it mrs coolidge was	holding it aloft	1635.8920677519932
2019. mrs coolidge looked down saw mama's horrified	expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor	1583.570905427336
2020. mama	swirled the train in place and not a step was lost	959.1401359286485
2021. the coolidges	did not always live at the white house during the presidency	787.7040607603273
2022. impressive as this enumeration is it barely hints at the diverse	perceptions of jews collectively or individually that have been	attested by their gentile environment	3889.9097502823242
2023. it is reasonable to affirm	two propositions: jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things	to all men; some jews have in fact been all things to all men	3204.862014101427
2024. in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody's	ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been	someone's enemy	3888.0957146639835
2025. in the market place jews have in fact under various	circumstances been valued customers and suppliers or clannish monopolists	and cutthroat competitors	2186.360001557669
2026. and so on through the roles referred	to in the previous paragraph	960.0053417614088
2027. diversity of perception yes; diversity	of fact yes	166.8652359104762
2028. but the two do not invariably or even	typically coincide	564.8508718101918
2029. the conventional image of a particular time	and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as	established over the years by scholarly and scientific research	3126.877381839678
2030. conventional	images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of	a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be	both true and false	4456.083142362551
2031. the genuinely interesting question then	becomes: what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion	in conventional images of jews	1880.1203775350525
2032. the working test of the facts	must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars	and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation	to relevant situations	4480.3920864239035
2033. granted such functional images are subject	to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they	are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against	error	2975.9908666890997
2034. in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors	can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions	regarding intelligence	2606.9140354162655
2035. general grant may have been the victim	of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so	he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed	to bad information and dubious estimates of the future	4306.291746996032
2036. but general	grant may have been self-victimized	140.0905368992779
2037. he may have entered the situation	with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the	press of affairs	1718.4643078138593
2038. predispositions in turn fall conveniently	into two categories for purposes of analysis	961.8854551711365
2039. to some extent predispositions	are shaped by exposure to group environments	501.35961913112095
2040. in some measure	they depend upon the structure of individual personality	749.1808472593827
2041. the anti-semitism	of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of	lueger's politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna	2030.1792762011562
2042. but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger's propaganda	and record	960.2696138944724
2043. after allowing for group exposures it is apparent	that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism	1876.7164604902457
2044. these are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts	within the whole man and mechanisms whereby inner components are	more or less smoothly met	3716.148533327647
2045. modern psychiatric knowledge provides us	with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind	1406.7013587427614
2046. the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual	images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or	fall short of it	3890.6597660310094
2047. undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile	conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that	it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination	in terms of reality	3734.3698024316086
2048. many selections are themselves convincing	contributions to this appraisal	392.6192685514303
2049. undoubtedly however the significance	of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest	944.2000726265982
2050. speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is	in the realm of future policy	2116.2055779339453
2051. since we can neither undo nor redo the	past we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow	1731.7768032620381
2052. in this	domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local national and	world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having	some effect large or small upon gentile-jewish relations	5475.949593404062
2053. what	shall these effects be	14.795624716530682
2054. i am deliberately raising the policy	problems involved in gentile-jewish relations	754.0970327083439
2055. comprehensive examination	of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual	tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method	1720.3045533539857
2056. the tasks	are briefly indicated by these questions: what are my goals in gentile-jewish	relations	1647.4316089347187
2057. what are the historical trends in this country	and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized	1882.4720574029757
2058. what factors condition the degree of realization at various	times and places	960.9752550717988
2059. what is the probable course of future developments	166.0102592679274
2060. what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will	increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired	events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values	5283.843478897912
2061. it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions	of such depth and range	1407.9699683058511
2062. the discussion is therefore limited to a	suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance	of this volume for future policy	3672.426424743933
2063. as a groundwork for the proposal	i give some attention to the first task enumerated above the clarification	of goal	1885.1523333253758
2064. my reply is that i associate myself with	all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute	to the theory and practice of human dignity	3892.0816443777317
2065. the basic goal finds partial	expression in the universal declaration of human rights a statement	initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many	religious and philosophical traditions	2986.437321501916
2066. within this frame of	reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the	jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved as well as upon	the nature of the claim the characteristics of the claimant the justifications	proposed and the predispositions of the community decision	makers who are called upon to act	7784.0949572886675
2067. if jews are identified as a religious	body in a controversy that comes before a national or international	tribunal it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity	to protect freedom of worship	3666.8022845601845
2068. when decision makers act within this	frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion	is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion	5007.276213226454
2069. since the recognition of israel as a nation state claims are made	in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body	politic	2873.3887010099743
2070. community decision makers must make up their minds whether	a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing	expectations regarding members of nation states	4261.817598907642
2071. in free countries	many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting	a vaguely cultural rather than religious or political identity	2324.623427700575
2072. the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must	decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate	to public policy regarding cultural groups	4665.520000128939
2073. we know that	much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that	cluster around the key symbol of the jew	2328.848761784539
2074. many public and private controversies	will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in	the mind and usage of gentile and jew	3060.061726225478
2075. however in the context of legal	and civic policy these controversies are less than novel	1101.661736212351
2076. they	involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any	number of non-jewish groups	1402.9144501844798
2077. so far as the existing body of formal	principle and procedure is concerned categorical novelties are not	to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships; claims are properly	disposed of according to norms common to all parties	3756.0528051751726
2078. it	is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched	within the public order of the world community or even of free	commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews	and gentiles during coming years	6326.949070732759
2079. social process is always anchored	in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations	where anchors are dragged or lost	2033.2157512439567
2080. in conformance with the	maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will	be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the	other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net	advantage taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration	6961.815952441614
2081. it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions	will cumulate; for instance imagine the situation if israel	ever joins an enemy coalition	2601.374901231222
2082. the formal position of americans who	identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the	jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors	cannot be so easily assessed	5490.283548435369
2083. when we consider the disorganized	state of the world community and the legacy of predispositions adversely	directed against all who are identified as jews it is obvious	that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted	with increasing vigor and skill	4676.379297991986
2084. during moments of intense crisis	the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming	964.1082715428017
2085. but their	freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which	they and the people around them enter the crisis	2320.8200520121636
2086. at such critical	moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously pay	off	1181.9613695892583
2087. by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality	exercise their most sinister impact with the result that men	of good will are often trapped and nullified	2859.546420537819
2088. among measures	in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants	of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of	the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also	able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near	the limit of self-control	7496.288290431783
2089. we are learning how to do these things	in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process	can be accelerated	2323.620319367199
2090. a truism is that the time to prepare	for the worst is when times are best	1878.7644126906387
2091. during intercrisis periods the	educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding	the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human	beings of every age and condition	3328.3436359420716
2092. as more men and women are made capable	of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved	that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength	in future crises can be favorably affected	5906.588117091893
2093. now an abiding	difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach;	and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation	of the goodness of the good	3424.6167930657816
2094. in any case i do not intend to	let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the	problem of implementing good intentions	3689.5255877182744
2095. i assume that the number of	readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is	small and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which	they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding	of others	4294.528830153982
2096. properly used the present book is an excellent instrument	of enlightenment	751.8088784151246
2097. let us not confuse the issue by labeling	the objective or the method psychoanalytic for this is a well established	term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated	by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered	personalities	4552.291833195745
2098. the traditional method proceeds by the technique	of free association punctuated by interpretations proposed by the	psychoanalytic interviewer	2348.1145137335416
2099. what we have in mind does have	something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods	by which they are sought	2457.830434575387
2100. for what we propose however a psychoanalyst	is not necessary even though one aim is to enable the reader to	get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself	4996.833785189504
2101. for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is	necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame	of mind	2455.2171687390737
2102. the relatively long and often colorful selections	in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in	what is said whether he responds with anger or applause	4477.904941241733
2103. but simple	involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open permissive	inquiring posture of self-observation	1248.7837637182265
2104. the symposium provides	an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which	were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were	addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages	everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification	6454.9368061218265
2105. an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important	and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage	of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances	within himself resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around	the central figure of the jew	5015.95356202528
2106. two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special	significance for our time	1641.097516656629
2107. one a reservation on the point i have just	made is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking pseudo-feeling and pseudo-willing	which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom	2741.6598441961883
2108. in essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the	values and experience of others rather than in one's own values	and experience	3684.603820783797
2109. there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how	to be himself	reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody	else	2710.823797733346
2110. clearly what the person brings to the reading is important	560.1930038127753
2111. moreover if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in	a work he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs	them in how to evaluate a work he is helping them to achieve their	own identity	4148.102547748953
2112. the second timely part of this sketch of literature	and the search for identity has to do with the difference between	good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products	of today	5485.443094044108
2113. in the range and variety of characters who in their	literary lives get along all right with life styles one never imagined	possible there is an implicit lesson in differentiation	3215.4991999331255
2114. the reader	observing this process might ask why not be different	745.7979223044922
2115. and	find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species	1097.8209522297257
2116. the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has	only a permit to be like the models he sees even more like everybody	else	4323.463639282243
2117. and this i think holds for values as well as life styles	641.2791222230768
2118. one would need to test this proposition carefully; after all the large	reader's digest literature on the	most unforgettable character i ever met deals with village grocers	country doctors favorite if illiterate aunts and so forth	5797.2358494072305
2119. scientists	often turn out to be idiosyncratic too	165.5561558683529
2120. but still the proposition	is worth examination	141.00443359816626
2121. it is possible that the study	of literature affects the conscience the morality the sensitivity to	some code of right and wrong	2181.4626492696693
2122. i do not know that this is	true; both flu^gel and ranyard west deal with the development	and nature of conscience as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber	4679.84821197665
2123. it forms the core of many perhaps most problems of psychotherapy	500.8170261513263
2124. i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the	psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development	of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate	period of life or for the theologians of course to the influence	of religion	7409.783815303563
2125. still it would be surprising if what one reads did	not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the	awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient	literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence	4316.432033235449
2126. probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development	of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature	but the contents of conscience the code which is imparted to the developed	or immature conscience available	6404.163083967233
2127. this is in large part a code	of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and	should do and how one should regard it	3101.6006081493692
2128. in a small way this is illustrated	by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful	influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated	this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover how to behave how	to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint	7593.529213644954
2129. literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose dedication	mission significance	943.4093170200858
2130. this no doubt is part of what gilbert seldes	implies when he says of the arts they give form and meaning	to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense	4987.976609918518
2131. men	seem almost universally to want a sense of function that is a feeling	that their existence makes a difference to someone living or unborn	close and immediate or generalized	3230.2617635582874
2132. feeling useless seems generally	to be an unpleasant sensation	394.9728750403651
2133. a need so deeply planted asking	for direction so to speak is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples	and heroic proportions of literature	2596.0437567629333
2134. the terms renewal	and refreshed which often come up in aesthetic discussion seem	partly to derive their import from the renewal of purpose and	a refreshed sense of significance a person may receive from poetry	drama and fiction	6070.224288053503
2135. the notion of inspiration is somehow cognate	to this feeling	375.57986673076863
2136. how literature does this or for whom is certainly	not clear but the content form and language of the message	as well as the source would all play differentiated parts in giving	and molding a sense of purpose	6085.304647155019
2137. one of the most salient features	of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and	organization of emotion	2025.1913895962493
2138. let us differentiate a few of these ideas	251.74204070580876
2139. the	aristotelian notion of catharsis the purging of emotion is a persistent	and viable one	1097.3116641277632
2140. the idea here is one of discharge but this	must stand in opposition to a second view plato's notion of the	arousal of emotion	3673.683743038019
2141. a third idea is that artistic literature serves	to reduce emotional conflicts giving a sense of serenity and	calm to individuals	2025.170579400898
2142. this is given some expression in beardsley's	notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision	1647.1415255067495
2143. a fourth view is	the transformation of emotion as in housman's fine phrase on the	arts: they transform and beautify our inner nature	2325.323363175317
2144. it is possible	that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea	1411.0081345413907
2145. fsc	northrop in his discussion of the functions and future	of poetry suggests this: one of the things which makes	our lives drab and empty and which leaves us at the end of the day	fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing practical	utilitarian concern of common-sense objects	5024.195696340423
2146. if art is to release	us from these postulated things things we must think symbolically	about and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the	aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy it must sever its connection	with these common sense entities	6902.2467602861525
2147. i take the central meaning	here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without	literature and a life enriched by it	2590.6113194344866
2148. richards' view of the aesthetic	experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes	in part the organization of impulses	3040.1976602052905
2149. a sketch of	the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account	of all of these	1871.0167784123328
2150. but there is one in particular which it seems	to me deserves special attention	1399.4842297847358
2151. in the wide range of experiences	common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage more	troublesome and more enduring in its effects than the control of love	and hate	3439.5980174959504
2152. the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious	way	957.4386981610794
2153. william wimsatt and cleanth brooks it seems to me have	a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected:	for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love	and if it is to talk of anger and murder	- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing	with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification compounding	or magnification or any direct assault upon the affections	at all	0.20124717349522497
2154. something indirect mixed reconciling tensional might well	be the strategem the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all	kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like expressions	of these emotions without aiming at their incitement or	even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement	7432.110857249984
2155. the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions	may be a most valuable human experience	1407.2067216547432
2156. here i do not mean	catharsis the discharge of emotion	557.7621885069584
2157. i mean something more like freud's	concept of the utility of play to a small child: he plays	house or doctor or fireman as a way of mastering	slightly frightening experiences reliving them imaginatively until they	are under control	4129.356000602112
2158. there is a second feature of the influences	of literature good literature on emotional life which may have	some special value for our time	3677.8432052014373
2159. in b m spinley's portrayal	of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london a salient	finding was the inability to postpone gratification a need to satisfy	impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring	the experience	4048.5536341042884
2160. perhaps it is only an analogy but one of the most	obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring	quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation	5493.633522038684
2161. anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature	will understand what i mean	1099.7805375101766
2162. it is at least possible that the capacity	to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in	a continuous and guided exposure to great literature	4107.161731901355
2163. in any	inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions particularly	with respect to the sense of harmony or relief of tension	or sense of a transformed inner nature which may occur a most	careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which	produces the effect would be required	5150.8193738070295
2164. in the calm which follows the	reading of a poem for example is the effect produced by the enforced	quiet by the musical quality of words and rhythm by the sentiments	or sense of the poem by the associations with earlier readings if it	is familiar by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate	by	the diversion of attention by the sense of security in a legitimized	withdrawal by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded	as forbidden or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of	words	0.30166232349522504
2165. these are if the research is done with subtlety and skill	researchable topics but the research is missing	1585.3024655760823
2166. one of the	most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility	that it is thought to provide	3246.853208649696
2167. sensibility is a vague word	covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent quality	or skill	1569.2697070020838
2168. among other things it means perception discrimination sensitivity	to subtle differences	745.0917416551374
2169. both the extent to which this is true	and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged	2037.338077806031
2170. its truth is illustrated by the skill sensitivity and general	expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre	3063.8483371098637
2171. the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast	the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues	in discriminating among motor cars political candidates or female	beauty	3216.4833522500676
2172. along these lines the particular point that sensitivity	in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more	proof than i have seen	3687.110189784036
2173. in a symposium and general exploration of	the field of person perception and interpersonal behavior the	discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one	possible exception; solomon asch shows the transcultural stability	of metaphors based on sensation dealing	with personal qualities of human beings and events	4951.934735041048
2174. but to go from here	to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will	also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential	leap	4857.51784644094
2175. i would say too that the study of literature	tends to give a person what i shall call depth	1723.7328242918386
2176. i use this term	to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event	or state of affairs a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts	and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling	6577.635608266547
2177. it	is the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia	262.1493890496968
2178. i	think these attributes cluster but i have no evidence	558.5739942976627
2179. in fact i	can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide continuous and	properly guided exposure to literary art	2315.1749675515393
2180. the late r g collingwood a philosopher whose work	has proved helpful to many students of literature once wrote we	are all though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it in	far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace	than with chaucer and cimabue or even shakespeare and titian	7979.500768018266
2181. by	an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the	art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the carvings of	cavemen and japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this	effort	is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the	greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries	and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not	taken place	0.20124717349522497
2182. the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy	contemporary art to despise and dislike the art of the recent past	and wholly to ignore everything else	4287.922585123224
2183. one might argue that	the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous	provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general	public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself	3953.185631724039
2184. there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the	contemporary	1188.68942644844
2185. such study may take many forms	43.23565994504135
2186. the study of ideas in	literature is one of these	564.7570702315265
2187. of course it goes without saying that no	student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene	1408.8565896565729
2188. he will	frequently return to it	64.47785387740801
2189. the continuities contrasts and similarities	discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible	and the one is often understood through the other	2467.0733993190265
2190. when	we assert the value of such study we find ourselves committed to	an important assumption	1873.1814615234405
2191. most students of literature whether they call	themselves scholars or critics are ready to argue that it is possible	to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them	3112.286874338207
2192. many will	add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding	1170.7165249740683
2193. this	understanding of course may in its turn take many forms and some	of these- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative	literature- are essentially historical	2982.80766405664
2194. but the historian of	literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic	questions of form texture or technique	3029.1891661283194
2195. he may also consider	ideas	15.02165967247824
2196. it is true that this distinction between style and idea often	approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and	content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes	appear as expressions of the same insight	6309.2994086522685
2197. but in general we	may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention	toward one or the other	2189.2653515254538
2198. at this point a working definition	of idea is in order although our first definition will have to	be qualified somewhat as we proceed	3673.278568483596
2199. the term idea refers to our	more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies	of sensuous or emotional experience	2044.71165967296
2200. it is through such reflection	that literature approaches philosophy	390.02810561923854
2201. an idea let us say may be	roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may	be concerned	2028.605304923789
2202. in this essay we are	along with most historians interested	in the more general or more inclusive ideas that are so to speak	writ large in history of literature where they recur continually	5331.170404560795
2203. outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself including	the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries;	also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man the depravity	of man and the dignity of man	4121.014503186817
2204. one might indeed argue that the	history of ideas in so far as it includes the literatures must center	on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of	literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference	to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning	7493.926582318067
2205. we need not to be sure expect to find such ideas in every piece of	literature	1245.781655626987
2206. an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of	necessity readily available to imagination is more general in connotation	than most poetic or literary images especially those appearing in	lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience	6667.269895536051
2207. thus	burns's my love is like a red red rose and hopkins'	the thunder-purple sea-beach plumed purple of	thunder although clearly intelligible in content hardly present	ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned	3875.353245440578
2208. on the other hand	arnold's the unplumbed salt estranging sea	taken in its context certainly does so	2117.0511532558808
2209. understanding a work	of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies	1097.7044877971348
2210. thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify	a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject	matter typical or atypical of its period	5466.3201290107745
2211. again he may discover embodied	within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere	and at other times in various ways	2456.8048635209175
2212. our understanding will very	probably require both these commentaries	397.9766720052889
2213. very likely it will also include	a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or belongs	to some way of thought labelled as a school or an -ism	ie a complex or syndrome of ideas occurring together	with sufficient prominence to warrant identification	4555.785286584335
2214. thus ideas like	grace salvation and providence cluster together	in traditional christianity	955.8392763425257
2215. usually the work studied offers us a special	or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in	question so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully	between the several expressions of an -ism or mode of thought	4308.515872781254
2216. accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley's	poems or the type of stoicism present in henley's invictus	and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism	and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or	mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise	7515.829585662327
2217. after all	shelley is no orthodox or hellenic platonist and even his	romantic platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries	2182.1335659791835
2218. again henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal	of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like	marcus aurelius whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian	comparable to the patience expressed in milton's sonnet on his own	blindness	6338.140677521032
2219. in recent years we have come increasingly to recognize	that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters	of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature	and the arts although these aspects should be studied in conjunction	with the history of philosophy of religion and of the sciences	5292.974007016505
2220. when these fields are surveyed together important patterns of	relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence	a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions primarily	literary religious and philosophical but frequently including	contact with the fine arts and even to some extent with science	7113.82486510633
2221. here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history	is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives	of the historian's research	2869.5572381679344
2222. let us quote once more from r g	collingwood: history is properly concerned with the actions	of human beings h regarded from the outside an action is an event	or series of events occurring in the physical world; regarded from the	inside it is the carrying into action of a certain thought h the	historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions	with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts	which constituted them	0.30166232349522504
2223. it is a characteristic of thoughts that h	in re-thinking them we come ipso facto to understand why they were	thought	2012.8064990755236
2224. such an understanding although it must seek to be sympathetic	is not a matter of intuition	1870.8117874722684
2225. history has this in common	with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim	any single piece of knowledge except where he can justify his claim	by exhibiting to himself in the first place and secondly to any one	else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration the grounds	upon which it is based	5504.112065004947
2226. this is what was meant above by describing	history as inferential	751.638600343819
2227. the knowledge in virtue of which a man	is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves	about certain events	2596.9592181092494
2228. it is obvious that the historian who seeks	to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout	a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of	his central and major concerns by no means a mere supplement or adjunct	of significant historical research	7323.152134124069
2229. the student of ideas and	their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of	transition which are at the same time patterns of transformation whereby	ideas pass from one area of activity to another	3943.2064274923177
2230. let us survey	for a moment the development of modern thought- turning our attention	from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements	that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades	5160.524144676899
2231. we may thus	trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious	practice and theological reflection through practical politics	and political theory into literature and the arts	3109.824089107147
2232. finally we may note	that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is	at present widespread	2360.1560960755446
2233. no one will deny that such broad developments	and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas	in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference	to them	3324.206024997562
2234. still we must remember that we cannot construct and justify	generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special	instances of influence moving between such areas as theology philosophy	political thought and literature	5768.808231842873
2235. the actual moments of contact	are vitally important	166.9224796258758
2236. these moments are historical events in the	lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature	must be frequently concerned	3255.0669094355376
2237. perhaps the most powerful	and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world	has been that of the old and new testament	2328.0310657113087
2238. certainly one of	the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural	life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen	or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders	have read and interpreted the bible	7006.407532062614
2239. this reading and the comments	that it evoked constitute the influence	502.5673888723213
2240. a contrast of the scripture	reading of let us say st augustine john bunyan and thomas	jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment	can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age	that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression	7621.161510051179
2241. in	much the same way we recognize the importance of shakespeare's familarity	with plutarch and montaigne of shelley's study of plato's	dialogues and of coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings	of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling	and william godwin through which so many abstract ideas were brought	to the attention of english men of letters	5402.48655864209
2242. we may also recognize	cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and	even indirectly the scientists	2372.1284779492325
2243. english philosopher samuel alexander's	debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example	as also a n whitehead's understanding of the english romantics	chiefly shelley and wordsworth	3007.3061814049042
2244. hegel's profound admiration	for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel	of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy	2811.464317833677
2245. again the	student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating if to our minds	grotesque anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the	natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius who in turn seems to	have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles	4554.291440690298
2246. here	an important caveat is in order	141.04461461284444
2247. we must avoid the notion suggested	to some people by examples such as those just mentioned that ideas	are units in some way comparable to coins or counters that can	be passed intact from one group of people to another or even for that	matter from one individual to another	4960.896412667715
2248. suppose you take mr hearst's morning american at	$10000 a year brisbane proposed	1182.2080642038359
2249. you could come down to the	office once a day look over a few exchanges dictate an editorial	and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary	labors	3466.006620227042
2250. if within one year you can make a success out of the american	you can practically name your own salary thereafter	3065.727866818128
2251. of course	if you don't make the american a success hearst will have	no further use for you	1579.2167160867612
2252. the blue-eyed watson decided that	he would dislike living in new york and the deal fell through	2127.4941041232833
2253. hearst's	luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k	lane a prominent california journalist and reform politician whom	he asked for his support	2882.0509204095233
2254. lane was still burning because he had narrowly	missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat	to the antagonism of hearst's san francisco examiner	4454.519977792691
2255. hearst	disclaimed blame for this but the conversation according to lane	ended on a tart note	1255.9837105866138
2256. mr lane hearst said if	you ever wish anything that i can do all you will have to do will	be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done	5172.981715068426
2257. mr	hearst lane replied as he left if you ever get a telegram	from me asking you to do anything you can put the telegram down	as a forgery	3132.839274026619
2258. hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to	new york to become a father	1645.2233532395956
2259. on april 10 1904 his first child was	born a son named george after the late senator	1416.9574848806733
2260. hearst saw his wife	and child sent a joyful message to his mother in california and	soon returned to washington where on april 22 for the first time	he opened his mouth in congress	5457.424252322558
2261. this was not before the house	but before the judiciary committee where he asked for action on	one of his pet bills that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad	monopoly	3337.846705830915
2262. attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and	had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united	states attorney for the southern district of new york	4992.20979024798
2263. hearst	had spent more than $60000 of his own money in the probe but still	attorney general knox was quiescent	1875.321595510132
2264. six of the railroads	carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields hearst said	not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright	at least eleven mines	4654.784959854115
2265. they had watered their stock at immense	profit then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton netting themselves	another $20000000 in annual profit	2721.7010360573613
2266. the attorney	general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a	doorknob for eighteen months hearst said	3052.8795068427976
2267. he has not acted in	any way and won't let anyone take it away from him h what i want	is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney	general does not report it as i am very sure he won't as he has	refused to do anything of the kind i then wish that a committee of	seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence	h	0.20124717349522497
2268. the congressman tried hard but failed	64.68304695565199
2269. this was the very	sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind	790.062999546071
2270. there can	be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington overt or	implied to block anything hearst wanted even if it was something good	4085.6546459705287
2271. hatred tied his hands in congress	43.25546966807997
2272. roosevelt and others considered	him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley	969.5019396918187
2273. they were repelled	by his noisy newspapers his personal publicity his presumptuous	campaign for the presidential nomination and by the swelling cloud	of rumor about his moral lapses	2985.96585688752
2274. he might get votes from his constituents	but he would never get a helping hand in congress	2122.4429352795823
2275. he was the	house pariah	14.905159531515983
2276. even the regular democrats disowned him	65.67288428941006
2277. inherently	incapable of cooperating with others he ran his own show regardless	of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on	2039.7066592993037
2278. he was a political	maverick a reformer with his own program determined to bulldoze	it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him	4088.047668913857
2279. he showed	little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats	640.9116130326972
2280. he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or	journal a scheme veteran legislators resisted	2597.206789946095
2281. for a freshman congressman	to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor	policy for one who needed to make friends	2022.9042459240543
2282. he soon quarreled with all	the party leaders in the house and came to be regarded with detestation	by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small	pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to	party discipline	6325.432774192039
2283. to old-line democrats the hearst presidential	boom now in full cry was the joke of the new century	1575.7767937863725
2284. yet no	leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t	r a semblance of a race	3267.326447918515
2285. there was talk of dragging old ex-president	cleveland out of retirement for another try	930.2619937743706
2286. some preferred	judge alton b parker of new york	389.8621262808854
2287. there was a host of dark	horses	93.67802393873312
2288. the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that	he had strong support in many parts of the country	3255.480759039325
2289. platoons of hearst	agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful	search for delegates at the coming convention and there were charges	that money was doing a large part of the persuading	3747.456514676423
2290. just when	it was needed for the campaign hearst paper no 8 the boston american	began publication	2122.4917263155367
2291. a bay state supporter said mr	hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of	his paper in boston	2029.4495780458717
2292. his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat	64.72539229015409
2293. he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain	from using such words as seduction rape abortion	criminal assault and born out of wedlock	2849.1102962416276
2294. in	a story headed hearst offers cash the republican new york	tribune spread the money rumor quoting an unnamed hearst	supporter as saying:   the argument that is cutting most	ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts	fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt	them if he were elected	8199.076563352657
2295. the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated	he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic	national committee the sum of $1500000	2604.3926356333322
2296. this it is urged would	relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the	trust magnates	2370.689050497
2297. the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate	is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the	trusts for their campaign funds and in doing this will incur obligations	which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless h	4400.507045154203
2298. the average democratic politician especially in the country districts	is hungry for the spoils of office	1884.2120768336995
2299. it has been a long time since	he has seen any campaign money and when the proposition is laid down	to him as the friends of mr hearst are laying it down these days	he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon	4547.788976872644
2300. if	anything the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than	the republicans	1183.8493727492628
2301. in his own state of new york the two democratic	bellwethers state leader hill and tammany boss murphy were	saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their	own favorites murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker	4052.125832536629
2302. they	had lost twice with the radical bryan and were having no part of	hearst whom they considered more radical than bryan	3270.200032430582
2303. but his increasing	strength in the west looked menacing	262.53969973527717
2304. it caused henry watterson	to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal:	h does any sane democrat believe that mr hearst a person	unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues without a word	or	act in the public life of his country past or present that can be	shown to be his to commend him could by any possibility be elected president	of the united states	8754.488380451921
2305. but there is a hearst	barrel h	more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee	a parker man	1572.3076655051009
2306. h the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin	of the party carmack said	1409.3738984031281
2307. it would be a disgrace and as i	have already said to the people of tennessee if hearst is nominated	we may as well pen a dispatch and send it back from the field of	battle: 'all is lost including our honor'	4399.318561084967
2308. a lone	pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery	who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence	in his own district	4814.473052224581
2309. i understand hearst is a candidate	for presidential honors devery said without cracking a smile	1104.4830509014016
2310. there's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up	252.5842427567894
2311. if he's	going to the st louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it	1261.1589634680245
2312. he's got a lot of friends and he ought to come along and let us	know if he wants our help	3049.3068652528104
2313. hearst won the iowa state convention	but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker	drawing an angry statement from indiana's john w kern:	we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic	by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase	the presidential nomination	5211.981386238256
2314. our state has been overrun with a	gang of paid agents and retainers h as for the paid hessians from	other states we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their	duty i have nothing but contempt h the hearst dollar mark is all	over them h	the talk of a hearst barrel was increasing	8001.24438295415
2315. another indiana observer later commented perhaps we shall	never know how much was spent by hearst but if as much money	was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered	3442.086509849527
2316. in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations	hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence	the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago	kingpin and once to meet with bryan	6050.322752051474
2317. on one visit he stopped at	the office of the american where he was known surreptitiously as	the great white chief and for the first time met his managing	editor fat moses koenigsberg	3560.894813194695
2318. koenigsberg never did learn what	hearst wanted for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door	2122.372171843297
2319. never mind thank you he said	43.65449930971401
2320. i must hurry to catch	my train	139.83789083458038
2321. another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle	of letters that had accumulated for him saying but mr hearst	what shall i do with this correspondence	2594.051218113843
2322. i'll	show you hearst replied grinning	65.04231638885479
2323. he took the stack of mail and	tossed it into the waste basket	785.5251068538757
2324. every letter answers	itself in a couple of weeks	389.10217636642113
2325. hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen	and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and	southern states always wearing a frock coat listening intently to local	politicians and generally making a good impression	4236.3503896004195
2326. he laughed	at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated	2120.0965065941004
2327. i should of course he said like any other man be	honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me	2184.3590690474784
2328. but	i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat	1409.9074495118525
2329. i have supported	the democratic party in the last five campaigns	500.35704201393565
2330. i supported	cleveland three times and bryan twice	249.53861841130802
2331. i intend to support the nominee	of the party at st louis whoever he may be	1256.719278130037
2332. the	hearst press followed the chief's progress at the various state conventions	with its usual admiring attention stressing the enthusiasm	and loyalty he inspired	3685.807552478623
2333. this was historic in its way for	it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised	his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land	3218.269263164415
2334. yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value	747.4048720070682
2335. when nan patterson a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who	had appeared in a florodora road show rode down broadway in a hansom	cab with her married lover frank young she stopped the cab to	disclose that young had been shot dead tearfully insisting that he	had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so	5443.05898004363
2336. trevelyan's liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit a	deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty	3490.9615659062574
2337. his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure	of garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation	in the events described	2738.98436046463
2338. the three volumes brought to	the fore a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous	through his later works- a genius for describing military action	with clarity and with authority	4834.149760854498
2339. the confused rambling of guerrilla	warfare such as most of garibaldi's campaigns were was brought	to life by trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books	3093.8063526978967
2340. his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed	much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have	been enough without other qualities	4077.2548120513084
2341. military knowledge love of	detail and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added	ingredients	1576.7372017082619
2342. but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic	story	559.2469330980935
2343. trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues	connected with his subject	640.3250909844026
2344. the outstanding example was in garibaldi	and the thousand where he made use of unpublished papers of	lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives	which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross	the straits of messina	6554.592930760262
2345. in looking back over the volumes it	is possible to find errors of interpretation some of which were not	so evident at the time of writing	2714.5094144926607
2346. thus trevelyan repeats the story	which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto	at the insistence of general radetzky	3278.823311173825
2347. later research has	shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false	1252.275291800595
2348. trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis he is	unduly critical of papal and french policy and he is more than generous	in assessing british policy	4096.40284053766
2349. but fifty years later the trilogy still	maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification	of italy a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at	the time of publication	3653.686868931568
2350. trevelyan's manin and the venetian	revolution of 1848 his last major volume on an italian theme	was written in a minor key	3259.0332579244637
2351. published in 1923 it did not gain the popular	acclaim of the garibaldi volumes probably because trevelyan	felt less at home with manin the bourgeois lawyer than with garibaldi	the filibuster	3314.8278128731135
2352. the complexities of venetian politics eluded him	but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures	with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of	the part played by its leading figure	5774.130088868991
2353. if it is not one of his best	books it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his	own garibaldi	2033.3492042055
2354. already trevelyan had begun to parallel	his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english	figures of the same period	2807.5835212034954
2355. first the life of john bright appeared	and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill	1413.2213187095927
2356. of	the two the life of bright is incomparably the better biography	965.0278932693724
2357. trevelyan	centers too exclusively on bright is insufficiently appreciative	of the views of bright's opponents and critics and makes light	of the genuine difficulties faced by peel	2867.5507979791914
2358. yet he is right when he	claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man	his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength	4646.699264161371
2359. in	the story of bright and the corn law agitation the crimean war	the american civil war and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects	something of the moral power which enabled this independent man	to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so	long	4683.3098303053575
2360. because bright's speeches were so much a part of him there	are long and numerous quotations which far from making the biography	diffuse help to give us the feel of the man	5150.873738525087
2361. associated in a sense	with the manchester school through his mother's family trevelyan	conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive	2457.4279669343987
2362. nineteenth-century virtues however seem somehow to have gone out	of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular	2815.66167236119
2363. the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography	at all	788.2754791230799
2364. it is a whig history of the tory reaction which preceded	the reform bill of 1832 and it uses the figure of grey to	give some unity to the narrative	4829.446009254294
2365. the volume is a piece of passionate	special pleading written with the heat- and often with the wisdom	it must be said- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians	from 1782 to 1832	3653.9599382950705
2366. characteristically trevelyan enjoyed writing	the work	65.79482136184212
2367. the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter	of discontent and repression was he has told us congenial to his artistic	sense	2456.4637324913756
2368. and grey's northumberland background was close to	trevelyan's own	391.34632653562574
2369. but his concentration on personalities and his categorical	assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities	of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted	with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social	transformation	4219.232155539447
2370. some historians have found his point of view not	to their taste others have complained that he makes the tory tradition	appear contemptible rather than intelligible while a sympathetic	critic has remarked that the intricate interplay of social dynamics	and political activity of which at times politicians are the	ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents	8332.93551638096
2371. the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan's	interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues	and oversimplified the period	2304.008860816629
2372. for once his touch deserted him	65.50585591877692
2373. research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to	a more ambitious work	1104.3255457499183
2374. britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook	designed to give the sense of continuous growth to show how	economic led to social and social to political change how the political	events reacted on the economic and social and how new thoughts and	new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process	7618.537105394978
2375. the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832	499.3916176407065
2376. more temperately	than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias trevelyan	vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days	portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich	colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp	and clear focus	7116.307021333836
2377. his technique is genuinely masterful	14.899763231651505
2378. by what one	reader called a series of dissolving views he merges one period	into another and gives a sense of continuous growth	3480.8217078815615
2379. but after	1832 the narrative tends to lose its balanced many-sided quality	and to become a medley of topics often unconnected by any single thread	2593.8200768120532
2380. economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the	england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis	2579.1957543128506
2381. yet after 1832 the interrelations of economic and social and political	affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional	political account	2332.5506175947694
2382. finally the period after 1870 receives	little attention and that quite superficial	957.4121953407564
2383. yet britain in the nineteenth	century became the vade mecum of beginning students of	history went through edition after edition and continues to be reprinted	up to the very present	3236.8767635077884
2384. its success is a tribute above all to	trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist	1412.593147845184
2385. in 1924 trevelyan	traveled to the united states where he delivered the lowell	lectures at harvard university	1416.5590641258423
2386. these lectures formed the nucleus of	a general survey of english development which took form afterward as	a history of england	3046.294539733598
2387. in short order the general history became	his most popular work and has remained aside from his later social	history the work most widely favored by the public	2998.542564742288
2388. the	history of england has often been compared with green's short	history	958.7513546835169
2389. like green trevelyan aimed to write a history not	of english kings or english conquests but of the english people	1878.7222835094835
2390. the history takes too much for	granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys and like	britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes	beyond 1870	5171.984224200031
2391. trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were	rarely happy ones	260.57763442874165
2392. but as a stimulating provocative interpretation	of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable	1879.5229928783017
2393. living	pictures of the early boroughs country life in tudor and stuart	times the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive	surveys of language and literature the common law parliamentary development	3445.5506885996556
2394. the strength of the history is also its weakness	392.96135806058066
2395. trevelyan	is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and	character over those of other peoples	1409.2611229022536
2396. his	nationalism was not a new characteristic but its self-consciousness	even its self-satisfaction is more obvious in a book that stretches	over the long reach of english history	4472.553624474733
2397. and yet the elements which	capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the	english story worth telling and worth remembering	2318.203513520081
2398. tolerance and	compromise social justice and civil liberty are today too often in short	supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan's emphasis on	their central place in the english tradition	5168.72336655594
2399. like most major works	of synthesis the history of england is informed by the positive	views of a first-class mind and this is surely a major work	2869.402685677149
2400. four years after the publication of the history of england the	first volume of trevelyan's queen anne trilogy appeared	2570.4238121543794
2401. by now	he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge	and had been honored by the award of the order of merit	2463.821854014431
2402. his academic	duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen	756.0481225315349
2403. blenheim	was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with	scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the	three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne	3561.171059162002
2404. like his volume on wycliffe the work was accompanied by the	publication of a selected group of documents in this case illustrative	of the history of queen anne's reign down to 1707	5143.274222066637
2405. trevelyan	was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious	desire to take up the story where macaulay's history of england	had broken off	2975.8863817170995
2406. in addition he believed in the dramatic	unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 lying between the stuart	and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own	4668.790615163857
2407. he saw	the age as one in which britain settled her free constitution	and attained her modern place in the world	2042.8034067466276
2408. to most observers there	is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon	the years of anne's reign which in reality existed only in the	pages	of his history	5297.332701936336
2409. of the three volumes blenheim is easily	the best	262.0804138161983
2410. in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay's famous	third chapter trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening	of the eighteenth century	3484.225093353113
2411. his delightful picture of society and	institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly	to life	1722.2637178366272
2412. he tends to underestimate- or perhaps to view charitably-	the brutality and the violence of the age so that there is an idyllic	quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality	5649.36831083023
2413. yet as an evocation of time past there are few such successful	portraits	in english historical literature	1406.0549325489542
2414. once the scene is set trevelyan	skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax	in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim	4652.315351823788
2415. the account of the battle is next to his descriptions of garibaldi's	campaigns trevelyan's outstanding military narrative	1410.4022980495654
2416. the	scene is etched in sharp detail the military problems brilliantly	explained and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident	3273.222845066782
2417. if only for this modest masterpiece of military history blenheim	is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations	have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars	3206.8791479717647
2418. ramillies	and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim	and much less of its dramatic unity	2586.4670613579715
2419. yet in several chapters	on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan copes persuasively	with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background	of scottish religion customs and traditions	3236.9835184561357
2420. i stood on a table surrounded by hundreds of expectant young	faces	960.1668485078937
2421. questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship	activities	638.7662559992343
2422. after making a short statement about human rights and the	freedom to travel i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge	the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany	5612.051924219254
2423. may we come with you	14.92685371726412
2424. called out a dozen young voices	65.71720585557905
2425. well i might not get that far i told them as actually	i have no papers to enter germany and as a matter of fact no permit	to return to france once i leave	3628.0134087499414
2426. that was all they needed	22.18326771737703
2427. we would all meet at ten o'clock at	the kehl bridge five miles from strasbourg and march triumphantly	across into germany	2040.195088061378
2428. there was only one hitch: the small town	of kehl on the other side of the rhine was still under french	jurisdiction	3262.3998225223854
2429. the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town's	limits	261.12195766220293
2430. in fact all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into	kehl there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river	3685.5807483312296
2431. that evening as i learned later the students enjoying that	spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students surged	out onto the streets of strasbourg overturning empty streetcars	marking up store fronts and shouting imprudently garry davis	to power!   as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the	next morning i was met by what looked like 5000 students some of whom	were carrying sticks apparently for the coming battle with the	police	0.20124717349522497
2432. alarmed by this display of weapons i looked toward the bridge	and there saw stretched across the near side a cordon of policemen	their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french	officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby	6925.049293866685
2433. listen please i called to the students in french	261.58373892625843
2434. i	thank you most heartily for being here	251.8421774141791
2435. this is full evidence of your	support for my principles	371.4973427375442
2436. these principles however will not be served	by violence in any form	960.2102085914873
2437. if they are right they will prevail of	and by themselves	499.8810929232062
2438. i ask you all to support me in this	388.62207479726396
2439. if one finger	is raised against the authorities all our moral power will vanish	942.7823303918797
2440. your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your	understanding of what i am saying	2345.747026690943
2441. i have full confidence in you	43.670526783884526
2442. i marched up to the waiting officials the students	massed behind me	963.1810648279998
2443. as usual the press photographers were on hand	165.1154190870327
2444. the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade	and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france	3463.9898896223217
2445. i replied	in the affirmative taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite	et de voyage on which was stamped a permission to leave fran	e	2586.981653925491
2446. he examined it carefully handed it back and said eh bien	you may leave france	1647.9242031272447
2447. i took one step h eastward	43.94221733383946
2448. one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way demanding to know	whether i had permission to enter germany	2588.920775011494
2449. no i have	no permission to enter germany i told him	498.13057818693886
2450. alors	you may go no farther he said imperiously	393.25341318588005
2451. is this then	the frontier	14.898848914427273
2452. i asked him	0.30041514999999996
2453. at this	the students let out a yell knowing full well the actual frontier was	beyond the town of kehl	1874.997226078609
2454. but i have no permission to re-enter	france and i have just left i told him	1884.0344853229738
2455. i must then	be standing on the line between france and germany	637.544075839666
2456. the	waspish man stepped forward	22.235994398327065
2457. line	0.20041515
2458. line	0.30041514999999996
2459. but there is no line	between france and germany that is no actual line h i mean	h   no line	1877.764148166859
2460. i asked	0.30041514999999996
2461. but if there is no line	how can there be two countries	639.737706041854
2462. you have just given me permission	to leave france which i did	950.2958725519935
2463. and as you know	i have no permission to re-enter france once out	786.9469118711628
2464. now i learn i	cannot	enter germany	139.86658327554744
2465. obviously i'm stuck on the line between the two	countries	375.05480369227814
2466. the students were laughing uproariously at this	piece of logic and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile	2804.3389042019926
2467. mais non the interior ministry man coaxed you	may come back to strasbourg now if you wish	1416.4434455496971
2468. oh	0.30041514999999996
2469. then	will you give me a visa to re-enter france	375.26412309933687
2470. visa	0.30041514999999996
2471. but there is no question of a visa	167.22571112454068
2472. you are still in france	22.071870686692556
2473. ah then please tell me where the frontier is because this	gentleman here- i indicated the french occupation officer- informs	me that germany is just on the other side of him	3337.035393036336
2474. the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot	395.531500722601
2475. from the	crowd were coming cries of he's right! there must be	a line! and bravo garry continue!   seeing their	hesitation i said well until i have permission to enter germany	or a visa to re-enter france i shall be obliged to remain here	h on the line between two countries whereupon i moved to the	side of the road parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on	the sidewalk sat down took out my typewriter and began typing the	above conversation	0.20124717349522497
2476. the reporters were questioning the interior	man and the french officer both of whom remained noncommittal as	to what action if any would be taken in my regard	4483.99895137903
2477. finally they	went	off to file their stories after the photographers had taken pictures	of my latest vigil	1571.862883349364
2478. the students crowded around asking questions slapping	me on the back and generally being friendly	1659.0596409568275
2479. but what	will you do this evening mr davis	263.6869158838557
2480. asked a young mustached	frenchman	22.30952989591143

2484. i have a small sports shop	in strasbourg	248.27807254719136
2485. that would be a great help i told him	thanking him for his thoughtfulness	942.1812247238237
2486. a special guard was posted at	my end of the bridge to make sure i didn't cross the ludicrousness	of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else- men	women and children dogs cats horses cars trucks baby carriages-	could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance	7211.298412792797
2487. the	day passed eventfully enough with a constant stream of visitors some	stopping only to say hello others getting into serious conversations	such as one andre fuchs a free-lance journalist from strasbourg	who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic	terms	4546.949731700275
2488. some students from the university returned around six	with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week	3041.209047799619
2489. a volunteer	food brigade had been arranged they told me which would supply	me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge	2598.0306061889005
2490. a little	later the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent	1172.147323596108
2491. one of	the girl students sitting by while i ate the thick soup asked me if	i had a sleeping bag	2034.4889493912074
2492. when i informed her that i didn't she said	she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening	3234.5234755324464
2493. you do not know me she said in good english but	my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child	2306.573258715878
2494. her name was esther peter	22.374081446954715
2495. i was delighted to make that personal	contact in such trying and unusual circumstances	936.6656797732667
2496. the peter family	proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days mrs	peter little esther and raoul who generously lent me his sleeping	bag for my watch on the rhine	4983.605557782156
2497. sighting a line from	the bridge to a small field directly to the side i pitched the tent	that evening on the stateless line digging a small trench around	it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child	4473.538311210383
2498. the wind from the rhine was damp and chill necessitating a fire	for warmth	1422.0030802655479
2499. after scouring around a bit in the open area i came across	what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly	giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky	3549.7726083019866
2500. each evening	the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits	pains esther usually being among them	2362.5981559826114
2501. i had advised friends to	write me to no man's land pont kehl between strasbourg and	kehl france-germany	1572.5793027382801

2503. on christmas eve students brought	out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the	tent	1725.9689679264357
2504. as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural	playground for the kids of the neighborhood i had made many friends	among them taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately	to translate grimm's fairy tales into an understandable	french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent	7977.965409947009
2505. to my great	surprise and delight when they saw the two trees they went rushing	off returning shortly with decorations from their own trees	2478.546973812633
2506. it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year	956.963476143713

2510. the special guard however was still posted on kehl bridge	555.3188616220507
2511. as it began raining at around eight o'clock on december	26th i retired into my tent early somewhat tired and discouraged	my body reacting sluggishly	because of the continued exposure	3229.868029770678
2512. no matter	how large the fire i couldn't seem to shake off the chill that	day	1887.6285312599298
2513. oh mr davis are you there	43.6458523727729
2514. a voice drifted	in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen	into a fitful sleep	3036.524724474618
2515. who is it	0.20041515
2516. we're from	the council of europe british delegation	249.36451855982418
2517. may we have a word with	you	94.9088316804217
2518. i'm sorry	0.30041514999999996
2519. i've had a trying day and i just	can't make it out again i told them	1249.9866369463712
2520. later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire	to see me hence their trip to no man's land	3056.712445523923
2521. on	the evening of december 27th esther noticed my pallid look and rasping	voice	945.8193570544145
2522. she entreated me to see a doctor and when i refused brought	one out to see me	2120.659809803259
2523. i wouldn't	hear of it because it meant giving up the line though i	realized i was in poor shape physically	2019.1966689108442
2524. esther mistaking my hesitation	assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by	a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached	4091.5351485524056
2525. no it's not that i told her	92.70979778696442
2526. you see once i relinquish	the position i've already established here i couldn't regain	it without sacrificing the logic of it	3040.9043018791162
2527. at that moment	up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a	world citizen from basel switzerland	2044.2468249970266
2528. without preliminaries esther	asked him if you are a world citizen will you take garry davis'	place in his tent while he goes to the hospital	4109.574981698314
2529. but	of course with pleasure he replied	94.17278127754386
2530. i looked from her to him	64.96864717175222
2531. what is your name	2.9724593385043203
2532. i	asked him	0.30041514999999996
2533. you	have just enlisted for the 'rhine campaign'	165.63747253796117
2534. esther	jumped up ran to him and gave him a little hug	965.0360701555101
2535. now come garry we must go quickly	93.78158027467944
2536. there is a police car	outside	65.81179388225384
2537. maybe they will take us	14.72491854384742
2538. such were the incongruities	of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me	were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world	citizen jean babel waved adieu from the line!	he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of	the final desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy	8117.565946944592
2539. when the	victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted with	his	horse pressed broadside against cleburne's log parapet in a tangled	group of infantrymen	2855.027842350032
2540. his hat was gone the tears were streaming	from his eyes	755.7744990952139
2541. he never knew how he got there	93.68863090749863
2542. six climactic minutes	in an individual's life left no memory	560.7665559716281
2543. eight hundred and sixty-five	rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were	captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day	2471.7812667365024
2544. eight	field guns were captured in position	139.09487742038806
2545. seven battle flags and fourteen	officers' swords were sent to thomas' headquarters	640.7702512499802
2546. it was	the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks	successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign	3039.6557906629687
2547. the	fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers	within a few minutes among them being several men whose time of service	had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment	3748.56215193354
2548. the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers one of the regiments	in thomas' first division during buell's command suffered	its greatest loss of the war in this action	4271.42272550473
2549. a popular belief	grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that	thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up	stanley for this assault	3850.065561049083
2550. sherman was responsible for the story when	he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall	seeing thomas ride so fast	4074.411003952688
2551. while thomas' injured back led him to	restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough	when he had to	2322.616921060037
2552. it is not in the record but he must have galloped his	horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward's guns to save	newton's crumbling line	4457.6289129082725
2553. while the final combat of the	campaign was being worked out at jonesborough thomas on sherman's	instructions ordered slocum now commanding the twentieth corps	to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing	his bridgehead to a counterattack	4456.328468109716
2554. the dispatch must have been sent	after sundown on september 1	755.8547886407026

2557. about noon they	came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy's station and deployed	1108.3721761280183
2558. the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the	enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation	from the balance of the line	5008.963137848111
2559. that night a note written in	slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman	stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta	2963.3298307773193
2560. before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note	to thomas	1419.4154864074549
2561. in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed	on his heels	787.8983643190769
2562. the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then making	up his mind that it was genuine snapped his fingers whistled and	almost danced in his exuberance	4093.167985084544
2563. the next day sherman issued	his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta	1416.4539971037352
2564. the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter	of personal choice	1648.5558168274947
2565. sherman laid great store by place captures	93.66129013469472
2566. hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors	562.3878078048077

2568. thomas thanked	his men for their tenacity of purpose unmurmuring endurance cheerful	obedience brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle	2818.397614280323
2569. sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well	executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the	larger fruits of victory	3437.8167691957788
2570. he supposed the military world would approve	of his accomplishment	562.948551705962
2571. whatever the military world thought	the political world approved it wholeheartedly	501.1932586577844
2572. for some time despondency	in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways- an	eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln	3506.4805137055946
2573. proposals	were in the air for a year's armistice	264.0348371779637
2574. lincoln was sure that he would	not be re-elected	390.5965407165806
2575. in the midst of this gloom at 10:05 pm	on september 2 slocum's telegram to stanton general sherman	has taken atlanta shattered the talk of a negotiated peace	and boosted lincoln into the white house	3766.9780755149927

2582. actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure	250.14295721057132
2583. next	best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action	1093.2390416772778
2584. sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably	nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy's to atlanta	3031.870816747452
2585. but so far as its territorial objectives were concerned the campaign	was successful	786.6524969843155

2594. modern warfare	was born in this campaign- periscopes camouflage booby traps land	mines extended order trench raids foxholes armored cars night	attacks flares sharpshooters in trees interlaced vines and treetops	which were the forerunners of barbed wire trip wires to thwart a cavalry	charge which presaged the mine trap and the general use of anesthetics	7890.7256214219715
2595. the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers	began to select tactical points by designating a spot as near the	letter o in the word mountain	3104.9032992294087
2596. a few weeks later the maps were	being divided into squares and a position was described as being about	lots 239 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196	5024.548271645723
2597. this	system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them	from a mobile lithograph press	1264.3216651512146
2598. orders of the day began to specify the	standard map for the movement	1181.795898487617
2599. sherman proved that a railway	base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta	campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks	2602.702052295202
2600. to the rebels it seemed	as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets	1645.3922062915135
2601. the whistle	of sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish	fire	940.1374257082422
2602. as always the ranks worked out new and better tactics but	there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods	and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their	military thinking	5779.037475618684
2603. the fossilized formalized precedent-based thinking	of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman's armies	1250.995010594947
2604. sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old	959.3984492187349
2605. one of sherman's most serious shortcomings however was	his mistrust of his cavalry	785.8922796759767
2606. he never saw that it was a complement to	his infantry and not a substitute for it	2106.709449224664
2607. then in some way this lack	of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging	effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice	3206.9847927298315
2608. a horse	needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with	two pounds	2127.0613028381094
2609. the horseman required eleven times more than the footman	261.3880846464285
2610. so sherman tried a compromise	22.486532620047324
2611. he would ship by rail five pounds per	day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could	be picked up off the country	2738.9339326195563
2612. already debilitated	by the chattanooga starvation the quality of sherman's horseflesh	ran downhill as the campaign progressed	2113.3873935468155
2613. every recorded request by	thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time	to take care	of his horses	2595.5118596659704
2614. well led properly organized cavalry	in its complementary role to infantry had four functions	1408.788611314175
2615. first	it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they were doing and hold	them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over	2730.0126457361966
2616. second	it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy	1195.8134060680552
2617. third	it could threaten at all times and destroy when possible the enemy	communications	943.5803546475387
2618. it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry	and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot	soldier	3692.517860485115
2619. its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated	enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign	1881.2786564426988
2620. thomas tried	hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet but his	plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum	mobility and with its commander stripped from it	5907.75365493756
2621. sherman knew	the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base	with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings	2325.721430839422
2622. his conception proved	workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean deft well	organized retreats with small materiel losses	3258.902660176486
2623. sherman insisted that	cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways yet garrard's	covington raid and rousseau's opelika raid cut two-thirds	of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of	what forrest might do to his communications	4441.5369932938975
2624. when mcpherson	pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive	movement the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted	infantry totally inadequate for its role	4817.588831089636
2625. it stumbled on infantry	where no infantry should have been and mcpherson's aggressive impulse	faded out overwhelmed by fears of the unknown	2180.622581827606
2626. a proper cavalry	command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into	one division of polk's army of the mississippi moving up from	the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton	5909.964161300775
2627. from the night	of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry	east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing	the greatest opportunity of his career	3852.913282276225
2628. a great part of the time	thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line	1880.5439082708206
2629. at such	times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike	him	798.1329428533478
2630. it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making	any disastrous mistakes	2333.249153738845
2631. heat during the atlanta campaign	coupled with unsuitable clothing caused individual irritation that	was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean	clothing	2849.0461006960295
2632. to relieve the itch and sweat galls the men got into the	water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally	the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private	truce while the men went swimming	6345.999911201159
2633. johnston believed that sherman put	his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various	fords	1422.4427526433444
2634. lieutenant colonel james p brownlow who commanded the	first brigade of thomas' first cavalry division was ordered across	one of these fords	3263.6762484661053
2635. the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers	across naked- except for guns cartridge boxes and hats	1567.7648558033259
2636. they	kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels drove	the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men	3696.9775592753176
2637. most of	the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff	brush than their naked pursuers	1876.9741012364902
2638. rank was becoming an explosive	issue in all three of sherman's armies	950.5607911677401
2639. merited recommendations	from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees	from civil life	1253.9760068822802
2640. in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of	meynell thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave	london before this new friendship had developed further:	that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed	by	w m's curious methods of handling me	7756.492453291163
2641. he never let me know	that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was	to leave for lymington	2166.5633885811008
2642. the result was that i found myself in the	ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for	the next week only two days before my departure from london	5014.7257295152685
2643. luckily	both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion	it was not i	1406.7988867654717
2644. it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not	generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements	which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant	4806.277698590184
2645. when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which	included fervent verses from pantasaph mrs king felt a proper	victorian alarm	2034.2738108557137
2646. some she knew looked upon thompson almost as a	saint	but others read in the hound of heaven what they took to	be the confessions of a great sinner who like oscar wilde had-	as one pious writer later put it- thrown himself on the swelling	wave of every passion	7439.405458433634
2647. consequently on october 31 1896	mrs king wrote to thompson quite against her daughter's wishes	asking him not to recommence a correspondence which i believe	has been dropped for some weeks	3341.129463756355
2648. katherine was staying at a convent	and her mother felt that as thompson himself seems to have suggested	she might eventually stay there	3464.6213986815646
2649. this prospect did not please mrs	king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might	marry a bohemian but she used it to suggest to thompson that	it	is not in her nature to love you	4019.932245918354
2650. for his part thompson	had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an	honorable friendship between katie and himself	3477.5083083328864
2651. at no time does he	seem to have proposed marriage and mrs king was evidently torn between	a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe	that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation	4121.452522887122
2652. in any case she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might	not see katie again now that this frank explanation has been made	+ no one can misunderstand	3539.1513047982626
2653. she ended her letter with the assurance	that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself	to be an honor from which she could not part without still more pain	3317.2806036555858
2654. after thompson came to london to live he received a	letter from katie which was dated february 8 1897	2581.701208217
2655. she regretted	what she described as the unwarrantable + unnecessary check to their	friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another	perfectly	1687.3746939853372
2656. this letter concluded with an invitation:   i	am a great deal at the little children's hospital	1889.2529793081048
2657. mr meynell	knows the way	14.836300101450927
2658. i know you are very busy now you are writing a great	deal + your book is coming out isn't it	1839.8142233976214
2659. but if you are able + care	to come you know how glad i shall be	641.7786537149076
2660. ever yours sincerely	katherine douglas king the invitation was accepted and	other letters followed in which she spoke of her concern for his health	and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled	children she served	6314.707478511432
2661. it is difficult to say what thompson expected	would come of their relationship which had begun so soon after his emotions	had been stirred by maggie brien but when katie wrote on april	11 1900 to tell him that she was to be married to the rev godfrey	burr the vicar of rushall in staffordshire the news evidently	helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes	for a new volume of verse	0.20124717349522497
2662. in a letter to meynell which was written	in june less than a month before katie's wedding he was highly	melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of	returning to the life of the streets:   a week in arrears	and without means to pay i must go it is the only right thing	7965.153632709473
2663. h	perhaps mrs meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep	my own copy of the first edition of my first book with all its mementos	of her and the dear ones	3549.293244049809
2664. h last not least there are some poems	which k king sent me when i was preparing	a fresh volume asking me to include them	3891.315924544844
2665. the terrible blow of	the new year put an end to that project	788.0513778851645
2666. i wish you would return them	to her	248.5662236005333
2667. i have not the heart	14.827280840434174
2668. h i never had the courage to look	at them when my projected volume became hopeless fearing they were	poor until now when i was obliged to do so	4640.305137857505
2669. h o my genius young	and ripening you would swear- when i wrote them; and now!	what has it all come to	2180.781152590263
2670. all chance of fulfilling my destiny is	over	251.16903626968514
2671. h i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems dear	father-brother now i am gone; and launch them on the world when their	time comes	2861.455620882529
2672. for them a box will be lodgment enough	248.05675312512432
2673. h katie cannot	mind your seeing them now; since my silence must have ended when	i gave the purposed volume to you	2172.301147970251
2674. h i ask you to do me the last	favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening about which time i shall	come to say my sad good-bye	4457.820525766475
2675. if you don't think much of them tell	me the wholesome truth	637.8252297392498
2676. if otherwise you will give me a pleasure	251.58722766692512
2677. o wilfrid! it is strange; but this- yes terrible step i	am about to take h is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found	hope that here in these poems is treasure- or at least some	measure of beauty which i did not know of	4697.2472664690995
2678. h thompson of	course	was persuaded not to take the terrible step; meynell once	again paid his debts and it was katie rather than thompson whose	life was soon ended for she died in childbirth in april 1901 in	the first year of her marriage	6875.500139685422
2679. the orphaned poems mentioned	in the letter to meynell comprised a group of five sonnets which	were published in the 1913 edition of thompson's works under the	heading ad amicam plus certain other completed pieces and rough	drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books	4770.752148870828
2680. the	publication of father connolly's the man has wings has made	more of the group available in print so that a general picture of	what it contained can now be had without difficulty	5331.353575213681
2681. some of the poems	express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love; others suggest its	coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final	separation	3338.8974683753995
2682. the somewhat petrarchan love story which these	poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more	than a little of autobiographical sincerity	3694.0728173624593
2683. when they were first	written there was evidently no thought of their being published and	those which refer to the writer's love for mrs meynell particularly	have the ring of truth	3324.089915515873
2684. in my song's young virgin date	for example thompson wrote: yea she that had my song's	young virgin date not now alas that noble singular she i nobler	hold though marred from her once state than others in their best integrity	6475.448247683764
2685. my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond and thereof shall	the ending not have end: but not for me that loved her to be	fond lightly to please me with a newer friend	3744.634912956584
2686. then hold it more than	bravest-feathered song that i affirm to thee with heart of pride	i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up true friend	by thy true side; whose absence dearer comfort is by far than	presences of other women are!   taking into account thompson's	capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish	to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known	unhappy loves there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for	katie king	0.30166232349522504
2687. that she was affected by his protestations seems obvious	but since she was evidently a sensible young woman- as well as	an outgoing and sympathetic type- it would seem that for her the word	friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that	which thompson gave it	4819.494591213796
2688. from the outset she must have realized that	marriage with him was out of the question and although she was displeased	by the unwarrantable interference it seems probable that	she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was perhaps	a man most fitted to live + die solitary + in the love	only of the highest lover	5671.674980662409
2689. the poems which were addressed	to her while they are far more restrained than those of love in	dian's lap show no great technical advance over those of the narrow	vessel group and are if anything somewhat more labored	4116.489430329411
2690. their interest remains chiefly biographical for they throw some light	on the utter despair which overtook thompson in the spring and early	summer of 1900	3900.2457339568036
2691. whether or not danchin is correct in suggesting	that thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from	this period is of course a matter of conjecture	2855.424374486508
2692. reid simply states	without offering any supporting evidence that after he returned	to london he resumed his draughts of laudanum and continued this	right up to his death	4437.026118723299
2693. there is every reason to recognize that in	the very last years of his life as we shall see thompson did take	the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness	but the exact date at which this began has never been determined	4759.878732871567
2694. if	as reid says nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not	taking opium there may be some reason to doubt that he was under	its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the	poems to katie king and making plans for another book of verse	7675.727873527665
2695. in	any event the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that	if he was taking laudanum it was never in command of him to the extent	that it had been during his vagrant years	3847.5868010382264
2696. meynell's remedy	for thompson's despondent mood was typically practical	390.2854217551452
2697. he simply	found more work for him to do and the articles and reviews continued	without an evident break	1739.030614887874
2698. as a reviewer thompson	generally displayed a judicious attitude	394.0643924712592
2699. that he read some	of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from	his notes which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable	basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without	his signature	4303.373859411255
2700. on the basis of this careful reading thompson frequently	gave a clear complete and interesting description of a prose work	or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry	4856.375350546261
2701. he was seldom an unmethodical critic and his reviews generally	followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work	contained a treatment of the things that had especially interested him	in it and wherever possible a balancing of whatever artistic merits	and faults he might have found	4841.7837072358625
2702. it was of course in this	drawing	of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire	to do full justice to an author	4273.722443217222
2703. reviewing davidson's the	testament of an empire builder for example thompson found	that	there was too much metrical dialectic	1718.237029671142
2704. poetry he said must be	dogmatic: it must not stoop to argue like a kc in	cloth-of-gold	2123.0477145343607
2705. yet davidson impressed him as a poet capable of sustained	power passion or beauty and he cited specific passages	to illustrate not only these qualities but davidson's command of	imagery as well	3446.761277658747
2706. similarly he wrote that laurence housman had a too	deliberate manner as well as a lack of inevitable felicity	in diction	3056.705933317851
2707. but he admired housman's subtle intellectuality	and delighted in the inversion by which divine love becomes the most	fatal allurement in love the tempter	2470.2277056615817
2708. of course	there were books about which nothing good could be said	957.1475303671001
2709. understanding	as he did the difficulty of the art of poetry and believing	that the only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of	poets he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please	when it came to the review of a book of verse	4932.943267882431
2710. as he had done on his first imperial sortie a year and a half	before lewis trekked southeast through red russia to kamieniec	3498.7725631687595
2711. thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into podolia	and nogay tartary or the yedisan	1740.9284511983956
2712. there along the east bank	of the southern bug opposite the hamlet of zhitzhakli a few miles	north of the black sea he arrived at general headquarters of the	russian army	4983.99171015809
2713. by june 19 1788 he had presented himself to its commander	in chief the governor of the southern provinces the director	of the war college- the prince	2855.407208664316
2714. catherine's first	war against the grand turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty	quite favorable to her	2583.121379933989
2715. by 1783 her legions had managed to annex the	crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now in this second combat with	the crescent were aiming at suzerainty over all of the black sea's	northern shoreline	3853.511015514432
2716. through most of 1787 operations on	both sides had been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove	decisive though many of their details are obscure	4081.815334125093
2717. to consolidate what	her navy had won the czarina was fortunate that for the first	time in russian history her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command	under her favorite giaour	3313.730392691597
2718. potemkin was directing this conflict	on three fronts: in the caucasus; along the danube and among the	carpathians in alliance with the emperor joseph's armies; and	in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of nogay tartary	and taurida including the crimean peninsula	6688.308528431165
2719. here the war would	flame to its focus and here lewis littlepage had come	941.7108343307066
2720. potemkin's	army of ekaterinoslav totaling it was claimed 40000 regular	troops and 6000 irregulars of the cossack corps had invested	islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the black sea	the fortress town of oczakov and was preparing to test the turk by	land and sea	7137.373114290245
2721. during a sojourn of slightly more than three months chamberlain	littlepage sould see action on both elements	1421.1077639465952
2722. as his	second in command the prince had marshal repnin one-time ambassador	to poland	1405.2508289134626
2723. repnin who had a rather narrow face longish nose	high forehead and arching brows looked like a quizzical mephistopheles	1730.024872537122
2724. some people thought he lacked both ability and character but	most	agreed that he was noble in appearance and for a russian humane	3484.200108597169
2725. the marshal came to know littlepage quite well	166.2912852181284
2726. at general headquarters	the newcomer in turn got to know others	753.0754292682856
2727. there was the neapolitan	ribas a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith	but who had fawned his way up the ladder of catherine's and potemkin's	favor till he was now a brigadier	designated to do in czar paul 1 after traveling all the	way		3788.6120768730884
2728. then there were	the distinguished foreign volunteers	140.86043887750586
2729. representing the emperor were	the prince de ligne still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and	general the count pallavicini founder of the austrian branch of	that celebrated italian house a courtier littlepage could have met	at madrid in december 1780	4377.651194393545
2730. from milan came the young chevalier	de litta an officer in the service of malta	1657.564025798608
2731. out of saxony rode	the prince of anhalt-bernburg one of the czarina's cousins and	a lieutenant general in her armies a frank sensitive popular soldier	whose kindnesses littlepage would always recall with the sincerest	gratitude	3753.4541560593307
2732. though catherine was vexed at the number of	french officers streaming to the turkish standard there were several	under her own such as the prince de nassau; the energetic parisian	roger de damas three year's littlepage's junior to whom	nassau had taken a liking; and the artillerist colonel prevost	whom the count de segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills	to nassau	8472.560332214704
2733. england contributed a young subaltern named newton and	the naval architect samuel bentham brother to the economist who far	his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the russian fleet	3220.965957722613
2734. from america were the messrs littlepage and jones	252.19377021769938
2735. lewis had expected to report at once to jones's and nassau's naval	command post	935.1108163301311
2736. on arrival at headquarters he had however- in king	stanislas' words to glayre- found such favor with pe	potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want	him to go join paul jones h	6199.289503254636
2737. so of course he stayed put	43.69778388647096
2738. having	done so he began to experience all the frustrations of others who	attempted to get along with serenissimus and do a job at the same	time	4284.281860104918
2739. the prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous	but these qualities were sapped by an oriental lethargy and	a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions	2981.0347017774616
2740. at headquarters-	sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally	that you were in a war- lewis found that the commander	in chief's only desk was his knees	4991.852330641754
2741. an entire theater had been set up for his diversion with a 200-man	italian orchestra under the well-known sarti	1740.261777228346
2742. in the great one's	personal quarters a portable house almost every evening saw an elegant	banquet or reception	2376.565030544737
2743. lewis could let his eye caress the prince's	divan covered with a rose-pink and silver turkish cloth or admire	the lovely tapis interwoven with gold that spread across the floor	3235.3329505563906
2744. filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of araby	250.80491237755618
2745. around the	billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals	940.8826782944125
2746. at dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red	capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers marching in	pairs like guards from a stage tragedy	4979.41809094828
2747. among the visitors arriving	every now and then there were of course women	785.9218586952522
2748. for if serenissimus	made the sign of the cross with his right hand and meant it	with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his	eye	4969.3528472678045
2749. usually lewis would find at headquarters one or more of the	prince's various nieces	944.8713611749554
2750. right now he found sophie de witt	that magnificent young matron he had spotted at kamieniec fours years	ago	2606.19753325732
2751. the prince took her with him on every tour around the area	and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of constantinople	as part of his espionage network	3091.9779568403005
2752. one evening he passed around the banquet	table a crystal cup full of diamonds requesting every female guest	to select one as a souvenir	3691.7566284791983
2753. when a lady chanced to soil a pair of	evening slippers brigadier bauer was dispatched to paris for replacements	1718.7658630113426
2754. but if the prince fancied women and was fascinated	by foreigners he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates	2588.537643622935
2755. he had collared one of his generals in public	262.91383404313365
2756. his coat trimmed	in sable diamond stars of the orders of saints andrew or george agleam	he was often prone to sit sulkily eye downcast in a scheherazade	trance	4652.116924897418
2757. when this happened everything stopped	14.711417163238991
2758. as littlepage	noted: a complete picture of prince potemkin may be had in his	1788 operations	1878.544746615303
2759. he stays inactive for half the summer in front of oczakov	a quite second-rate spot begins to besiege it formally only	during the autumn rains and finally carries it by assault in	the heart of winter	3844.949569841646
2760. there's a man who never goes by the ordinary road	but still arrives at his goal who gratuitously gets himself into	difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat in a word a man who creates	monsters for himself in order to appear a hercules in destroying	them	7379.140909326574
2761. to help him do so the prince had conferred control	of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost	every respect save one: both were eccentrics of the purest ray	serene	3866.0741070461613
2762. alexander vasilievitch suvorov now in his fifty-ninth	year was a thin worn-faced person	of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany	3881.4738835273843
2763. he	had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side a large flat nose	and penetrating blue eyes	1723.6428272308422
2764. his gray hair was thin his face beginning	to attract a swarm of wrinkles	1412.9273367991557
2765. but suvorov's face	was also a theater of vivacity and his tough stooping little frame	was briskness embodied	1569.825800630241
2766. like all russians he was an emotional man	and in him the emotions warred	1411.5565744090197
2767. kind by nature he never refused charity	to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it		1093.301048865793
2768. but he was perpetually engaged in a battle to	command his own temper	1185.4181968009955
2769. when littlepage was introduced if the	general behaved as usual the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries:	origin	1738.8360971412044
2770. age	0.30041514999999996
2771. mission	0.20041515
2772. current status	0.30041514999999996
2773. woe betide the	interviewee if he answered vaguely	168.10400134342993
2774. suvorov's contempt for don't-know's	was proverbial; better to give an asinine answer than none	at all	1872.5411151641445
2775. despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier he slept on a	pile of hay with his cloak as blanket	1881.19054421662
2776. he rose at 4:00 am the	year round and	was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake	his men	3481.3283018379325
2777. his breakfast was tea; his dinner fell anywhere from nine	to noon; his supper was nothing	1244.2099035042245
2778. he hadn't worn a watch or carried	pocket money for years because he disliked both but highest among	his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's	grasp and smashed it to smithereens	5794.212538119854
2779. he kept several pet birds	and liked cats well enough that if one crept by he would mew at it in	friendly fashion	2325.5534264839926
2780. passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark	249.20917208350602
2781. yet general suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing his adored	czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities- was mad	only north northwest	2463.6224847156145
2782. he had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity	allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at court; in	camp he knew it won you the affection of your men	5013.651624200482
2783. he had accordingly	cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature	499.9634689947114
2784. underneath he	remained one of the best-educated russians of his day	756.1662522013631
2785. he dabbled	in verse could get along well among most of the european languages	and was fluent in french and german	2030.0950732353995
2786. he had also mastered the cossack	tongue	141.3344825750051
2787. for those little men with the short whiskers shaven	polls and top knots suvorov reserved a special esteem	1574.4876418594486
2788. potemkin-	as king stanislas knew and presently informed littlepage- looked	on the cossacks as geopolitical tools	1885.3095915046401
2789. to serenissimus such tribes	as the cossacks of the don or those ex-bandits the zaporogian	cossacks	were just	elements for enforced resettlement in say bessarabia where as	the faithful of the black sea borders he could use their presence	as baragining points in the czarina's territorial claims against	turkey	4899.431725261271
2790. suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic	units but military men of a high potential	1890.596105010812
2791. he knew how to	channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere	plunderers into a-1 guerrilla	fighters	1896.1880625151778
2792. he always kept a few on his	personal staff	393.1587250800109
2793. he often donned their tribal costumes such as the	one featuring a tall black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled	a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels;	broad red stripes down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round	the waist holding cartridges and light sabre	5176.022866166544
2794. suvorov played parent	not just to his cossacks but to all his troops	1175.033310923668
2795. it was probably at	this period that littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary	russian soldier	1566.9365889335324
2796. these illiterate boors conscripted from villages	all across the czarina's empire had suvorov may have told lewis	just two things a commander could count on: physical fitness and	personal courage	4851.198015615455
2797. when their levies came shambling into camp they	were all elbows hair and beard	946.9512242426177
2798. they emerged as interchangeable cogs	in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked hair queued	greatcoated jackbooted and best of all- in the opinion of the	british professional major semple-lisle- their minds are not	estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge	which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny	7888.791037026652
2799. mando pleading her cause must have said that dr brown was the	most distinguished physician in the united states of america for	our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating	the irregularity of his pulse	4198.196231442349
2800. he's got high blood pressure too	and bum kidneys the doctor said to me	1406.1078629276185
2801. transparent look waxy	skin- could well be uremia	167.49860958072216
2802. he looked disapprovingly at an ash	tray piled high with cigarette stubs shook his head and moved his	hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture	4288.83862912396
2803. the little official	hung his head in shame	166.880421488454
2804. seeing this his colleague at the next desk	gave a short contemptuous laugh pushed forward his own ash tray innocent	of a single butt thumped his chest to show his excellent condition	and looked proud	5643.809973530778
2805. the doctor gravely nodded approval	14.82281223062014
2806. at this moment mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem	was solved and all norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers	4285.142428328087
2807. we	went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents	and more officials awaited us the rest of the office personnel hot	upon our heels	3242.074696430703
2808. by this time word had got around that an american doctor	was on the premises	1654.2105220493318
2809. one fellow who had liver spots held out his	hands to the great healer	937.6272527617323
2810. it was funny but it was also touching	249.99512880278152
2811. you	know norton said to me later i am thinking of setting	up the klinico brownapopolus	1242.0320318452143
2812. i might not make any money but i'd	sure have patients	741.8080727533168
2813. after luncheon we took advantage of	the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our	dear friend deppy had written	2848.55279808163
2814. deppy is despina messinesi a long-time	member of the vogue staff who although born in boston was	born there	of greek parents	3252.770959135049
2815. several years of her life have been spent in	the homeland and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming	2324.5978079791194
2816. all you have to do ilka dear is to phone on your arrival	1181.7670079148572
2817. they are longing to see you	43.772352405310826
2818. the wear and tear of life have taught	me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers	but i planned on being the soul of tact of giving them plenty	of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already	running over without us	7383.743602631429
2819. greek phone service	is worse than french so that it was to be some little time before	contact of any sort was established	2312.759666284134
2820. in the late afternoon	mando came back to fetch us and we drove to the acropolis	1883.7225887957459
2821. we stopped	first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned	by the parthenon	1568.8526905087165
2822. the curving benches are broken chipped tumbled	but still in place as are the marble chairs the seats of honor	for the legislators	3478.7165694188748
2823. the carved statues of the frieze against the low	wall are for the most part headless but their exquisitely graceful nude	and draped torsos and the kneeling atlantes are well preserved in	their perfect proportion	3755.8583066573874
2824. having completed our camera work we	started our climb	393.9730639965436
2825. i suppose the same emotion holds if to a lesser	degree with any famous monument	1095.2216590759017
2826. will it live up to its reputation	139.6252895077121
2827. the weight of fame and history is formidable and dreary steel engravings	in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination	2031.3518776555616
2828. uh	huh we think looking at them so that's the parthenon	755.0577546162611
2829. and then	perhaps one day we get to athens	260.2596230479959
2830. we are here! we've come a	long way and spent a lot of money	1412.8165409981016
2831. it had better be good	14.76176174202927
2832. don't worry	about the acropolis	22.22475579252022
2833. probably every visitor	has a favorite time for his first sight of it	788.658153407421
2834. we saw it frequently	afterward but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset	1881.7013945105239
2835. the light at that time is a benediction	167.280279062759
2836. the serene majestic	columns of the parthenon tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky	frame incredible vistas	2584.009287140817
2837. all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly	and look and look and look	1261.4238547412397
2838. more than twenty-four hundred	years old bruised battered worn and partially destroyed combining	to an astounding degree solidity and grace it still stands incomparable	testimony to man's aspiration	4479.597669710662
2839. in 1687 the turks who had been	in control of the city since the fifteenth century with a truly shattering	lack of prudence used the parthenon as a powder magazine	3230.4679763813883
2840. it	was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding venetian army and the great	central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens	3696.7861102955394
2841. nearby	is the temple of athena	43.44712907072272
2842. the architectural feature the caryatides	upholding the portico famous around the world as the porch of the	maidens was referred to airily by mando as the girls' place	4506.459978765562
2843. another beautiful building is the propylaea the entrance gate of the	acropolis	646.8836873391522
2844. my other nugget of art and architectural knowledge-	besides remembering that it was ghiberti who designed the doors	of the baptistery in florence- is the three styles of greek columns	4813.6086998758165
2845. for some happy reason doric ionic and corinthian have always	stuck in my mind	942.8460232683865
2846. furthermore i can identify each design	65.46503815094752
2847. it remained	however for mando to teach me that doric symbolized strength	ionic wisdom and corinthian beauty the three pillars of the ancient	world	2471.2520798596456
2848. the columns of the parthenon are fluted doric	251.91689846611808
2849. another	classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry	in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes who was patrolling	up and down in front of the palace	3547.007354702778
2850. gun on shoulder he would	march smartly for a few yards bring his heels together with a click	make a brisk pirouette skirts flaring and march back to his point	of departure	5164.777290966542
2851. we did not dare speak to so exalted a being but norton	aimed his camera and shot him so to speak on the rise the split second	between the halt and the turn	3564.2702745668175
2852. the evening of our first	day we drove with christopher and judy sakellariadis who were friends	and patients of norton to dine at a restaurant on the shores of	the aegean	4998.697159954657
2853. on the way out mr sakellariadis detoured up a special	hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the acropolis lighted	by night	2609.1004892131787
2854. the great spectacle was a source of rancor and	son et lumiere which the french were trying to promote with the	athenians	was the reason	3878.5817615320025
2855. these performances were being staged at historical	monuments throughout europe	376.8299470690943
2856. by a combination of music lighting	effects and narration famous events that have transpired in	these	locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to	considerable acclaim	4452.566909066639
2857. the acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment	too but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full	moon when the athenians themselves out of respect for the natural beauty	of the occasion were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination	4668.344244817445
2858. athenian society was split into two factions the philistines	and the artists	969.1524055789257
2859. the artists contended that the philistines	gross of soul were all for having son et lumiere since the	french were footing the bill and the attraction wherever it had been	done had proven popular	3652.697587501426
2860. this was the crassest kind of materialism	and they the artists would have no truck with it	2117.955605156271
2861. the acropolis	was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight	wasn't enough for both natives and tourists then they were quite	simply barbarians	and the hell with them	3545.611420745011
2862. the restaurant to which the sakellariadises took us on this night	of controversy was the asteria on asteria beach	2593.375665035181
2863. this is a public	bathing beach easily accessible by tramway from the center of athens	1098.2895917025999
2864. office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during	the siesta period which during the summer lasts from two until five	in the afternoon when shops and offices are again open for business	5627.566474198848
2865. they close sometime after eight	14.990834922751745
2866. nine o'clock is the rush hour	when the busses are jammed and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning	to fill	2837.866441512474
2867. bedtime is late for the balmy evenings are delightful	and everyone wants to linger under the stars	1412.424223389046
2868. the sand is fine	and pleasant the cabanas are clean and the parasols green raspberry	and butter yellow are very gay	3069.732451827298
2869. although open to the general	public it is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive	private beach club at home	2195.7701300450863
2870. we went there a couple of times to swim	and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly	1175.1441426476663
2871. this agreeable state of affairs is	explicable i think on two counts	644.9111702600487
2872. one is greece is not yet suffering	from overpopulation	390.5176917691372
2873. the public may still find pleasure in public	places	261.00476705184434
2874. the other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols though	modest from an american point of view still is a little high for	many athenians	4104.845789115148
2875. we were struck by the notable absence of banana skins	and beer cans but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on greek	refinement perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable	radios	3640.2870594984875
2876. greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll and the stations	most tuned to are those carrying united states overseas programs	3046.6719029994247
2877. a good deal of english was spoken on the beach most educated greeks	learn it in childhood and there were also american wives and	children of our overseas servicemen	3090.0183464837946
2878. for a delightful drive out	of athens i should recommend sounion at the end of the attic peninsula	2346.6701993647266
2879. the road a comparatively new one is very good winding along	inlets coves and bays of deep and brilliant blue	1887.7830123014107
2880. i suppose the	day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments	but at present it is deserted and seductive	3470.546853714084
2881. three beneficial	hurdles to progress are the lack of water electricity and telephones	787.5200214836485
2882. at sounion there is a group of beautiful columns the ruins	of a temple to poseidon of particular interest at that time as active	reconstruction was in progress	4467.98783930968
2883. gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins	and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet	in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to	match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original	4035.9524325389657
2884. later they	would be hoisted into place	141.8339324471685
2885. there is a mediocre restaurant at	sounion and i fed a thin little grecian cat and gave it two saucers	of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as though it were	nectar	3751.87846729008
2886. i think its thirst had never been assuaged before	392.0451660344726
2887. norton	and i dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in piraeus right	on the water's edge	1426.5082559385655
2888. to enter it you go down five or six steps	from the road	1204.5163863317503
2889. across the road is the kitchen and waiters bearing great	trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their french colleagues	at the restaurant in the place du tertre in paris	3348.9706156384673
2890. this restaurant	too had a cat a dusty thin little creature	752.3091004569632
2891. how can	a cat be thin in a fish restaurant	374.03471940553493
2892. but this one was	4.409337810600458
2893. when offered	a morsel it glanced right and left and winced obviously frightened	and expecting a kick but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit	2601.8185976879513
2894. greece	was one of the highlights of our trip but beginning in greece and continuing	around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of	animals was horrifying ranging from callous indifference to active	cruelty	5504.731173294901
2895. this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated	people we met who loved their pets but kindness is not a basic human	instinct	2720.798431416033
2896. we met some charming athenians and among them our	chauffeur panyotis ranked high	1180.1376391421275
2897. his english was limited and the	little he knew he found irritating	645.1672420603774
2898. a particularly galling phrase was	ok panyotis we have time at our disposal	1173.5280207669996
2899. this he	claimed was the favorite refrain of the english	374.6300828520399
2900. they would be lolling	under a tree sipping ouzo relishing the leisurely life assuring	him that the day was yet young	3059.4504321026366
2901. let him become honest and they discard him	168.157715138924
2902. but let him be ready	to invent whatever falsehood- to assail whatever character- and	to prostitute his paper to whatever ends- and they hug him to their	heart	4479.260837729917
2903. in proportion to the degradation of his moral worth is the	increase of his worth to them	1408.7165200476315
2904. to exonerate the legislature	and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation pike took another	course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked	4076.2342968958937
2905. he	claimed in his attacks that woodruff with scurrilous underhandedness	had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the	honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract	without knowing what they were doing	4133.395279044439
2906. the charge was so farfetched	that woodruff paid little attention to it and answered pike	in a rather bored way wearily declaring that a new hand was	pumping the bellows of the crittenden organ and concluding: in	a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles	even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels	8134.781557030217
2907. the game	is not worth the ammunition it would cost	375.6485608800482
2908. we therefore leave the writer	to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse	he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd	to which he belongs	5655.778520447251
2909. despite woodruff's continuing refusal	to debate with pike through the columns of his newspaper pike	did not let up his attack for a moment	2440.4243039487037
2910. over the months he became a	political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing	woodruff the casca letters belittling woodruff and long	analytical articles vilifying woodruff	4482.204500410646
2911. so persistent were these attacks	that in march of the following year woodruff was finally moved	to action and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics	the subtle art of diversion	3643.377413534103
2912. to attack pike directly would	gain woodruff little for as a penniless newcomer pike had nothing	to lose	2361.716714637031
2913. by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a	man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a towering rage	if his integrity were questioned and who would be anxious to avenge himself	3941.7478196504317
2914. pike's honor would now come under attack but not by woodruff	himself	957.045470525913
2915. the charges would be made in the gazette by an anonymous	correspondent and pike would be so busy trying to track down the	illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing woodruff	3561.6069571612124
2916. pike was stunned by the	first blast against his character which was published in the march	4th issue of the gazette under the name vale	3905.8912649570616
2917. the anonymous	correspondent did not resort to innuendoes	166.75226327467476
2918. he called pike a thief	22.284045066572457
2919. he said pike had stolen mules from harris during the santa fe	expedition; he accused pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career	in arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in van buren	3557.5053940256303
2920. the	charges caught pike off balance coming as they did from an unexpected	quarter	1411.8555363508563
2921. outraged he used the advocate of march 7th for a	denial sending immediately to santa fe and van buren for documents	to vindicate himself and demanding that woodruff reveal the name	of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym	4388.728217152124
2922. woodruff said nothing and pike frustrated stormed	throughout little rock in an unsuccessful search for vale	asking	his friends to keep their ears open	3699.8377258158225
2923. finally he learned through	the grapevine that the culprit might be one james w robinson in	pope county	1581.5109872012222
2924. without further inquiry pike jumped to the conclusion	that robinson was guilty and following the honorable route that	would	eventually lead to the dueling ground sent a message to robinson	through his friends demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity	6578.545061016803
2925. to pike silence was tantamount to an	admission of guilt and he determined to get robinson onto the dueling	ground at all costs	2321.871650725373
2926. on april 11th he wrote an open letter in the	advocate making it known to the world that jas w robinson	is by his own admission a base liar and a slanderer	5209.868582577897
2927. if robinson was a liar and a slanderer he was also	a very canny gentleman for nothing that pike could do would pry so	much as a single word out of him	3462.357481266882
2928. preoccupied with his own defense and	his attempts to get robinson to fight pike lessened his attacks	on woodruff and finally stopped them altogether	3673.225450354609
2929. and pike never did	find out if robinson was really responsible for the vale letter	1094.8801664016587
2930. woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful	65.39899191591556
2931. it	took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done and it had	a profound effect on him	1883.9566890844712
2932. once he learned a lesson he never forgot it	392.0356441215789
2933. in the next few months of comparative silence pike waited patiently	until conditions were perfect for a new attack and then displaying	a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting gained	from his first bout with woodruff he used these changed conditions	to excellent advantage	4670.206487163202
2934. shortly after the vale incident	a rift began to develop between william woodruff and governor pope	1886.7735611909823
2935. one-armed gruff frugally honest governor pope had been the	ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the disgraceful antics of	political bosses like crittenden and he ruled the state with an iron	fist tolerating no nonsense	3969.3317628666287
2936. woodruff had supported him all the way	both as a chief executive and as a man	1901.718769741295
2937. besides being political allies	they were also friends	166.34741428368844
2938. this warm relationship came to an abrupt	end in june of 1834 when the national congress appropriated $3000	for compiling and printing the laws of arkansas territory and	taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature left	it to the governor to award the contract	7241.714424439937
2939. woodruff wanted this	political windfall very badly and everyone assumed that he would get	it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter	2994.3121763874897
2940. after all woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was	the logical man for the job	1885.3490604911053
2941. but because the governor was determined	that friendship should not influence him one way or the other he looked	for a printer with a knowledge of the law	and awarded the contract to a lawyer named john steele who	had started a newspaper in helena the year before	4837.966228027261
2942. considering the governor's act a personal rebuff he aired	his feelings in the gazette on august 26 1834: we think	the governor treated us rather shabbily to say the least of it	5175.70727657798
2943. h	it is but justice to mr steele for us to add that in the above	remarks nothing is intended to his disparagement either as a lawyer	or as a printer	3335.7137814010603
2944. he got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his	good luck	1410.642617920154
2945. we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle	him to credit	1253.5861183915324
2946. as summer cooled into fall and winter	even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder	by the day and by december of 1834 it was icy	4855.699877041525
2947. it was at this point	that pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two	men	1569.225996319187
2948. the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract	that woodruff still held	1876.795860345473
2949. from his first bout with the	canny woodruff pike had learned that it was better not to attack him	directly so harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too	high he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs	to exist	4679.636362045129
2950. to document his charge pike set up two parallel columns	in the advocate showing the price charged by the gazette and	the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere	5338.9338948591985
2951. then he called on the governor to explain why	262.09851009954565
2952. the governor	was not used to having his integrity questioned and he promptly	passed the charges on to woodruff demanding that woodruff answer them	3668.082337304694
2953. if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor	insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in	the advocate	2606.2892703716043
2954. woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma	566.0431454305499
2955. as a proud man his prestige would suffer if he let pike dictate	to him through the governor's office but to lower his prices would	be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first	place	4221.765647163153
2956. as a consequence he did neither	65.24082913201723
2957. very angry at woodruff	the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract	withdrawn from the gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder which	by a strange coincidence happened to be pike's advocate	3778.050024627641
2958. and for the moment at least the governor now found himself allied with	the head of the crittenden faction he had formerly opposed and pike	was credited with a clear triumph over woodruff	5332.846589022038
2959. but in	the	confused atmosphere of frontier politics alliances were as quickly	broken as they were formed and as pike came to favor with the governor	of the territory the governor fell out of favor with the president	of the united states	4374.131078557499
2960. on january 28 1835 andrew jackson removed	pope from office and elevated territorial secretary william	s fulton to the position	2832.075069723188
2961. fulton was a very close friend of jackson	and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the	old days	2325.568181767816
2962. as a stanch party man and a rabid democrat he had little	tolerance for whigs like pike and pike lost any immediate personal	advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him	5144.188197417248
2963. as pike proved himself adept in the political arena he also became	a social lion in the village of little rock where he served as a symbol	of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly	to cultivate	4388.7133128292835
2964. after all pike was an established poet and his work	had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of	american culture boston	3703.028461559951
2965. his accomplishments and the fact that he	was resident did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to	describe little rock after a visit there	2724.634608561902
2966. for some reason none of	them were impressed with the territorial capital	956.4839021372863
2967. the internationally	known sportsman and traveler friedrich gersta^cker was typical of	its detractors in the mid-thirties	1260.8959732793041
2968. little rock is a vile detestable	place h	254.113760822301
2969. little rock is without any flattery	one of the dullest towns in the united states and i would not have	remained two hours in the place if i had not met with some good friends	who made me forget its dreariness	4310.106527030109
2970. pike enjoyed his	new social position tremendously and cultivated in himself those traits	necessary to its preservation	2118.2475024137066
2971. he was especially popular with women	for like the romantic poetry he wrote he was personally gracious	gallant and chivalrous	1883.6948819524416
2972. he again began to play the violin and tucking	the instrument beneath his chin performed soulful and romantic airs	to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered	to hear him	5622.564818930289
2973. his artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into	any social gathering	372.7732492883236
2974. he composed songs and set them to music and	sang them in a soft melodious voice and when his audience had had enough	of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western	adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike	7140.666919916517
2975. the bulk of his early reputation however came not from	his poetry or his music but from his excellence as an orator	2185.8631396675305
2976. by 1834	the art of oratory had reached a very high level in the united states	as a literary form	2842.356007497906
2977. the orator of this period in order to earn a	reputation had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his	speech judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect	it would have on the audience that heard it	4534.595436941647
2978. very soon after his	arrival in little rock pike had joined one of the most influential	organizations in town the little rock debating society and it	was with this group that he made his debut as an orator being invited	to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every	year	7721.808308055637
2979. samuel gorton founder of warwick was styled by the historian	samuel greene arnold one of the most remarkable men who ever lived	2166.7471963003863
2980. a biographer called him the premature john the baptist of	new england transcendentalism	1185.4159924220662
2981. the historian charles francis	adams called him a crude and half-crazy thinker	646.3437374829268
2982. his contemporaries	in massachusetts called him an arch-heretic a beast a miscreant	a proud and pestilent seducer a prodigious minter of exorbitant	novelties	3525.636803442073
2983. edward rawson secretary of the colony of massachusetts	bay described him as a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies	and insolence a corrupter of the truth a disturber of the peace	wherever he comes	3878.234097638398
2984. nathaniel morton stated he was deeply leavened	with blasphemous and familistical opinions	958.4296959356454
2985. he was thrown	out more or less from boston plymouth pocasset newport and providence	945.9087262615112
2986. on the other hand dr ezra styles recorded the	following testimony of john angell the last disciple of gorton:	he said gorton was a holy man; wept day and night for	the sins and blindness of the world h had a long walk through the trees	and woods by his house where he constantly walked morning and evening	and even in the depths of the night alone by himself for contemplation	and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light	0.30166232349522504
2987. he was universally	beloved by his neighbours and the indians who esteemed him	not only as a friend but one high in communion with god in heaven	2875.1003953461573
2988. gorton sometimes signed himself a professor of the mysteries of	christ	752.0233853703797
2989. there is plenty more to recommend gorton the facts	of whose life are given in the life and times of samuel gorton	by adelos gorton	2587.838089608876
2990. he fought like a fiend for the helpless and	oppressed worked for the abolition of slavery helped the quakers	and indians and worked against the prosecution of witches	4484.585986617803
2991. he defied	the boston hierarchy and after they sent a small army to get him	he befuddled the court including john cotton with one of the most	complicated religious discourses ever heard	3438.24794458419
2992. samuel gorton was	born at gorton england near the present city of manchester about	1592	1640.5877740797005
2993. although he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities	he was a master of greek and hebrew and could read the bible	in the original	2742.5108360967492
2994. he worked as a clothier in london but was greatly	concerned with religion	1185.700599894107
2995. gorton left england he said	to enjoy libertie of conscience in respect to faith towards god	and for no other end	2027.030226698429
2996. with his wife and three or more children he	arrived in boston in march 1637 and soon found it was no place for	anyone looking for liberty of conscience	4649.074449175596
2997. roger williams had recently	been thrown out and anne hutchinson and her antinomians were slugging	it out with the powers-that-be	1870.3988817032646
2998. gorton and his family moved to	plymouth	140.31847049015897
2999. soon he was in trouble there for defending a woman	who was accused of smiling in church	1401.8897407857453
3000. she was ellen aldridge a widow	of good repute who was employed by gorton's wife and lived with	the family	2801.6054073282885
3001. the report was:   it had been whispered privately	that she had smiled in the congregation and the governor prence	sent to knoe her business and command after punishment as the bench	see fit her departure and also anyone who brought her to the place	from which she came	4832.220493577532
3002. gorton said they were preparing to deport	her as a vagabond and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for	several days returning at night	4282.466241494165
3003. he advised the poor woman not to	appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of	law	2161.603663674077
3004. gorton appeared for her however and what he told the magistrates	must have been plenty for he was charged with deluding the court	fined and told to leave the colony within fourteen days	5304.90089352848
3005. he left in	a storm for pocasset december 4 1638	377.817581539155
3006. his wife was in delicate health	and nursing an infant with measles	963.2879984218123
3007. the unconquerable mrs	hutchinson was residing at pocasset after having been excommunicated	by the boston church and thrown out of the colony	2189.2173582636688
3008. one can imagine	that with her and gorton there it was no place for anyone with	weak nerves	2341.44694188839
3009. william coddington who was running the colony felt constrained	to move seven miles south where with others- as mentioned	above- he founded newport	2327.3486220878312
3010. when in march 1640 the two towns	were united under coddington gorton claimed the union was irregular	and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the	majority of freeholders	5149.71787057622
3011. then he became involved in a ruckus	remarkably similar to the one in plymouth	945.9199174509009
3012. a cow owned by an old woman	trespassed on gorton's land	753.2908892439482
3013. while driving the cow back home the	woman was assaulted by a servant maid of gorton	1253.1802797375133
3014. the old woman complained	to the deputy governor who ordered the servant brought before	the court	1886.7777113934767
3015. gorton reverted to his plymouth tactics refused to let	her go and appeared himself before the portsmouth grand jury	1729.228653656764
3016. during	the trial he told off the jury called them just asses and	called a freeman a saucy boy and jack-an-apes	3050.500759798793
3017. he was jailed	and banished	14.772574705058947
3018. gorton then moved to providence and soon put the	town in a turmoil	1182.831035780157
3019. he held that no group of colonists could set up	or maintain a government without royal sanction	1425.173149310287
3020. since rhode island	at that time did not have such sanction his opinion was not popular	1869.0592694155214
3021. roger williams wrote his friend winthrop as follows:   master	gorton having foully abused high and low at aquidneck is now	bewitching and bemaddening poor providence both with his unclean and	foul censures of all the ministers of this country	and also denying all visible	and external ordinances in depth of familism: almost all suck in	his poison as at first they did at aquidneck	5697.915750250496
3022. some few and myself withstand	his inhabitation and town privileges without confession and	reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at portsmouth; yet	the tide is too strong against us and i fear	it will force me to little patience a little isle next	to your prudence	7104.358635704595
3023. williams also stated: our peace was like	the peace of a man who hath the tertian ague	1416.619449277797
3024. providence finally	managed to get gorton out of the town and he and some friends	bought land at pawtuxet on the west side of narragansett bay five	miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the providence colony	6070.569626450561
3025. this town should not be confused with pawtucket just north of providence	or pawcatuck connecticut on the pawcatuck river opposite	westerly rhode island	2326.2510094626914
3026. up to now gorton had been looking	for trouble and now that he was trying to get away from it trouble	started looking for him	3878.981816261362
3027. upon intelligence that the formidable	agitator was to favor them with his presence the benighted inhabitants	of pawtuxet alas gave their allegiance to massachusetts and asked	that colony to expel the newcomers	3446.6161669019843
3028. as it was the custom of that alert	colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection	this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack	of wolves and saying come and get it	6426.03675030177
3029. gorton and company	however promptly bought land from miantonomi a few miles south	of pawtuxet extending from the present gaspee point south to warwick	neck and twenty miles inland	3115.8558039779336
3030. the settlement was called shawomet	22.193582570829868
3031. it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything including	providence and massachusetts	947.4417911507783
3032. if gorton wanted peace and quiet	for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it	2363.9904664614783

3073. getting out again seeing old friends	had given his spirits a lift	647.4498399047479
3074. that night after supper i went	back over to 48 spruce street- ralph and i at that time were living	at 168 chestnut- and ralph went with me	4472.553426653084
3075. papa was still elated	over his afternoon visit downtown	259.7557782269796
3076. baby i saw a lot of old friends	i hadn't seen in a long time he told me his eyes bright	3044.0256099111875
3077. it was mighty good for the old man to get out again	636.4307367468425
3078. the	next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent	spirits	1875.1807945004743
3079. but a few days after fred's return he began hemorrhaging	and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration	1887.426393035259
3080. it	began in the morning and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one	1422.5867853014845

3084. it'll take a lot to replace	it	139.5270087463784
3085. dr glenn i've got a lot of blood fred	spoke up plenty of it	938.159213451527
3086. let me give papa blood	22.082355149548103
3087. the doctor	agreed but explained that it would be necessary first to check fred's	blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as	papa's	2977.9624764570644
3088. to give a patient the wrong type of blood said the doctor	would likely kill him	1886.494528268056
3089. that was in the days before blood banks	of course and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to	patient	2025.3236655897376
3090. one had to find a donor and usually very quickly whose blood	corresponded with the patient's	1876.6905386247158
3091. and then it took considerably	longer to make preparations for giving transfusions	636.6236760696339
3092. they had to take	blood samples to the laboratory to test them for one thing and there	was much required preliminary procedure	3250.0643052695173
3093. they made the tests	and came to fred; by now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa	had begun hemorrhaging	2177.1344915550835
3094. fred your blood matches your	father's all right dr glenn said	752.3338049914597
3095. but we aren't going	to let you give him any	374.43026957211504
3096. but why in the name of god can't	i give my father blood	1183.365302628251
3097. fred demanded	0.20041515
3098. why can't i	doctor	4.405619839434726
3099. because fred it could do him no good	168.42281054212268
3100. he's past helping	0.30041514999999996
3101. he's as good as gone	14.814359123975953
3102. and in a few minutes papa was dead	248.69528894913327
3103. it was well past midnight	14.859874690128905
3104. papa had left us about the same hour of the night that ben had passed	on	1890.4960588035567
3105. the date was june 20 1922	43.634096429166036
3106. w o wolfe	prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section died shortly	after midnight tuesday at his home 48 spruce street the asheville	times of wednesday june 21 announced	5016.949940411102
3107. mr wolfe	had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected	1097.5379042194406
3108. funeral services were	held thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home	959.0368669042115
3109. beloved dr	r f campbell our first presbyterian church pastor was	in charge	785.7929146511708
3110. the burial was out in riverside cemetery	140.77700394302707
3111. all about him	stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned	645.9344977808568
3112. a few years before his death papa had agreed with mama to make a	joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of	the	death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children	whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash	7696.861788697477
3113. at his death	fred and ralph my husband were named executors of the estate under	the terms of the will	1882.4670876446366
3114. fred and ralph qualified as executors	and paid off what debts were currently due and they were all current	since papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid	4798.1504894794925
3115. the bills	were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the	last years of his life and when he died he owed in the main only current	doctor's bills	3114.222165201853
3116. after they had paid all his debts and the funeral	costs ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars as i remember	with which to pay the bequests	4489.669871388236
3117. this manifestly would not	provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children	787.289268866988
3118. so what	fred and ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking	into account what each of the five had received if anything from	the estate before papa's death	5343.034517664686
3119. consequently fred and tom the	two who had been provided college educations signed statements to the	effect that each had received his bequest in full and effie and i	were each allotted $5000	3552.951445933525
3120. frank had been given about half his legacy	to use in a business venture before papa's death; he was given the	difference between that amount and $5000	4274.303293963043
3121. tom had received four years	of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard	and fred had been in and out of georgia tech and carneigie	tech and part of the time had been a self-help student	4206.003556857867
3122. so because	he had received less than tom it was felt proper that fred should receive	the few hundred dollars that remained	3240.2410795822907
3123. and that's how papa's	estate was divided	93.62465992821703
3124. papa i should emphasize had been an	invalid the last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor	bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving	little except	small rentals on some properties he still owned	6681.233222651421
3125. had	he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism i'm convinced	papa would have left a sizable estate	1872.5739410451001
3126. but he had succeeded well	we agreed	139.6335012013013
3127. he had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands	and stocks and bonds	1418.8771974897961
3128. for years papa and mama had been large	taxpayers	391.4052793378847
3129. i recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800	262.9361306806998
3130. in those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates that	payment represented ownership of much property	2351.1190894302254
3131. merciful god	julia! i have known papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill	we're going to the dogs!   but he never expected to	do that	2716.897324231632
3132. and he didn't by a long shot!	in the spring	of his second year at harvard tom had been offered a job at northwestern	university as an instructor in the english department	5163.303697520058
3133. but	he had delayed accepting this job and as he was leaving to come home	to papa in response to our telegram he dropped a postcard to miss	mccrady head of the harvard appointment office asking her please	to write northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances	4684.4067522479
3134. actually tom had been postponing giving them an answer i'm	confident because he did not want to go out there to teach	3235.9764082179668
3135. in fact	he didn't want to teach anywhere	165.96383450152342
3136. he wanted to go back to harvard	for another year of playwriting	956.822128678213
3137. but papa's death had further complicated	the financing of tom's hoped-for third year and for the	weeks following it tom did not know whether his return to harvard could	be arranged	3336.104462173795
3138. but things were worked out in the family and	late in august he wrote miss mccrady an explanatory letter in which	he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition	after papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home	with mama accept the northwestern job or return to harvard	8117.046862466191
3139. but	he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition	that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor	baker	3093.796529936048
3140. and that's what he did	22.113209407965122
3141. that third year he wrote plays	with a fury	263.79140355344884
3142. i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now	housed in the houghton library at harvard; i think i'm right	in that figure	3670.5255059284245
3143. that fall he submitted to professor baker the first	acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays six of them	according to some of his associates and he also worked on a play	that he first called niggertown the material for which he had collected	during the summer at home	5081.6538341340965
3144. later this play would be called welcome	to our city	559.4489799413168
3145. in the spring it must have been he began	working on the play that he called the house which later would	be mannerhouse	2308.32935865529
3146. that spring welcome to our city was selected	for production by the 47 workshop and it was staged in the middle	of may	3472.894737632574
3147. it ran two nights and though it was generally praised there	was considerable criticism of its length	1404.021152542041
3148. it ran until past one o'clock	66.10851852907923
3149. that was tom's weakness; it was demonstrated many critics	would later point out in the length of his novels	1719.6080083883712
3150. in this play	there were so many characters and so much detail	959.72028998317
3151. tom never knew how	to condense to boil down	259.27816121536745
3152. he was always concerned with life and he	tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed tight	2359.1686816807974
3153. he	was a big man and he wanted nothing little squeezed; he despised parsimony	and particularly of words	1567.5535285605033
3154. in this play there were some thirty	or more named characters and i don't know how many more unnamed	2600.434473561943
3155. in describing it to professor baker after it had been chosen for	production he defended his great array of characters by declaring that	he had included that many not because i didn't know how to save	paint but because the play required them	4444.156033800929
3156. and he threatened someday	to write a play with fifty eighty a hundred people- a whole	town a whole race a whole epoch	3497.753723132692
3157. he said he would do it though	probably nobody would produce it for his own soul's ease and	comfort	1743.6814076641015
3158. that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard	but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall	3257.6872540144245
3159. instead	he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city	to the theatre guild which had asked him to let them have a look at	it after professor baker had recommended it highly	3868.81839921774
3160. he hung around	new york waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production	and in that time came down to asheville and also paid a short visit	to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visited old	friends and favorite campus spots	6938.445499654595
3161. on returning to new york he had	a job for several weeks; it was visiting university of north carolina	alumni in new york to ask them for contributions to the graham	memorial building fund	3647.7424861805644
3162. the graham memorial would be the campus	student union honoring the late and much beloved edward kidder graham	who had been president when tom entered the university	4303.154001233013
3163. well	the theatre guild kept that play and kept it and finally in	december they turned it down	1572.1965847738848
3164. but they would reconsider it they assured	him if he would rewrite it	1180.2371955491794
3165. tom told me about it how one evening	he went over to see the theatre guild man	1422.45390510707
3166. this man tom said	had the play shut up in his desk i believe and when tom sat down	he pulled it out and apologetically told tom that they wouldn't be	able to use it	5589.760027467772
3167. tom said he almost burst into tears he was so	disappointed and put out	946.0766342578547
3168. the man tom said explained that it was	not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort	of thing the public wanted	4466.770961462207
3169. the public tom said the man told him	wanted realism and his play wasn't that	1094.410709663922
3170. it was fantastic writing	beautiful writing the man declared but the public he insisted	wanted realism	1883.5362945861775
3171. tom was not willing to revise the play according	to the plan the man suggested	1099.9935965061843
3172. such a revision he said would ruin	it would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment	3051.242019283148
3173. he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do	it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made	2332.1509399837823
3174. it was not until we had returned to the city to live while i	was still at brown and sharpe's that i felt the full impact of	evangelical christianity	4608.098371372723
3175. i came under the spell of a younger group	in the church led by the pastor's older son	1579.449133268366
3176. the spirit of this group	was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed to eternal	punishment but that god through jesus christ has provided a way of	escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation	6294.243859415527
3177. there are millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed are those	who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on	their souls night and day	3463.7948555183875
3178. this group in park place church was made	up of the earnest few	1183.9377731219934
3179. i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns	and responsibilities	505.7742181085244
3180. i engaged more and more in religious activities	249.89380149053665
3181. besides church and sunday school i went to out-of-door meetings	on the sidewalk at the church door	1412.2517590716793
3182. i went to an afternoon service	at the ymca	391.9228629805101
3183. i went to the christian endeavor society	and to the evening service of the church	1105.7872984324808
3184. much of this lacked the active	support of the pastor	564.5753520181843
3185. the young people were self-energizing and	i was energized	260.27730986374195
3186. once or twice my father asked me if i wasn't overdoing	a bit in my churchgoing	1873.3027623893588
3187. meanwhile i myself was not yet	saved	93.15480675800525
3188. at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of	conversion	1413.6191440022792
3189. try as i might to confess my sins and accept salvation	no answer came to me from heaven	1571.760525345083
3190. finally after years i gave up	64.95278778014259
3191. the basic difficulty i suppose was in my ultimate inability	to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief	2028.2507980798516
3192. i was familiar	with pilgrim's progress which i read as literature	751.1733906420548
3193. no load	of sin had been laid on my shoulders nor did earnest effort enable	me to become conscious of one	2024.4003813888357
3194. there is of course the doctrine	of original sin which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes	of the guilt of our first ancestor	3890.5873781651835
3195. in the rhyming catechism this	doctrine is worded thus: in adam's fall we sin-ned all	1099.2540556852637
3196. this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense	249.13272100851722
3197. i did not feel	it presumptuous to expect that the creator would be at least as just	as the most righteous of his creatures; and the doctrine of original	sin is compounded of injustice	3667.385228579192
3198. some of these thoughts- not	all of them- have taken organized form in later years	1636.5422790562266
3199. the actual	impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another	sort	938.1382971088018
3200. i became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of	my own miserable soul	1651.6916588860058
3201. i found myself becoming one of that group of	people who in carlyle's words are forever gazing into their own	navels anxiously asking 'am i right am i wrong'	3099.4044101155214
3202. i bethought	me of the lord's prayer and these words came to mind:	thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven	4322.472530740067
3203. they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years	which since have passed	1565.822208594485
3204. from that time to this my religious concern	is that i might give effective help to the bringing in of god's kingdom	on earth	3684.413994337213
3205. i do not claim to be free from sin or from the	need for repentance and forgiveness	1427.6376860904757
3206. in my experience the assurance	of forgiveness comes only when i have confessed to the wronged one and	have made as full reparation as i can devise	4314.6432681502165
3207. there was one	further step in my religious progress	262.525417847491
3208. this was taken after i came	to live in springfield and it was made under the guidance of the reverend	raymond beardslee a young preacher who came to the congregational	church there at about the same time that i moved from new york	6690.729345283541
3209. his father was a professor at hartford theological seminary	and from him he acquired a conviction which he passed along to me that	there is in the universe of persons a moral law the law of love	which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law	5032.785682347897
3210. it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable	in all personal relationships whether individually socially	or as between whole nations of people	4476.607255908742
3211. if obeyed the law brings order	and satisfaction	167.99514657288935
3212. if disobeyed the result is turmoil and chaos	252.07632864289081
3213. as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable	790.8672611421313
3214. we can conceive of no alternatives	65.01144587508449
3215. their basis seems deeper	than mere authority	94.3625725457114
3216. they are not true because scientists or prophets	say they are true	963.6284264829852
3217. it is not the authority of god himself which	makes them true	640.5452003556893
3218. because god is what he is the laws of the universe	material and spiritual are what they are	2355.921576508309
3219. deity and law are one	and inseparable	94.86855575013938
3220. with this conviction the partition between	the sacred and the secular disappears	964.9208918363627
3221. one's daily work becomes sacred	since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law	dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy	3346.3729091625164
3222. in his book civilization and ethics albert schweitzer faces	the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business	life for example	3682.1331485469577
3223. his ethics defines possessions as the	property of the community of which the individual is sovereign steward	1413.6705083361678
3224. one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain	number of employees draw their means of subsistence; another by giving	away his property in order to help his fellow man	5161.702233073169
3225. each will decide	on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according	to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular	circumstances of his own life	3458.8949292745033
3226. no one is to judge others	65.19476332571304
3227. he is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds	it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for	the sake of a larger good	3227.3267124251697
3228. for this decision a man must take personal	responsibility	389.7915288844728
3229. says he i may never imagine that in the struggle	between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible	to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape	of a relative ethic; or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive	4625.416573532807
3230. on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between	the two	1883.1265530076957
3231. schweitzer seems in fact to acquire for himself	a burden of sin not bequeathed by adam but accumulated in the	inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and	lesser responsibilities	3538.4608646347733
3232. this viewpoint i find interesting but it	has never weighed on my soul	1182.8389803667358
3233. my own experience	has followed simpler lines	94.16705679722384
3234. an uncompromising belief in the	moral law has the advantage of making religion natural even as physical	law is natural	2852.4900460583985
3235. neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels	any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy	nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience	3107.3665296396825
3236. to	obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense applied to a neglected	field	1659.1912998542211
3237. religion thus becomes integrated with life	43.64204583000368
3238. this	truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries	965.3700704812375
3239. one	of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life	638.9034038470317
3240. in seeking	for such meaning and purpose albert schweitzer seized upon the concept	of the sacredness of life	2344.8983435459177
3241. it is puzzling to the occidental	mind to assign sacredness to animal insect	and plant life	1258.4697793850485
3242. these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order	and are unburdened with moral responsibility	1880.1487798624926
3243. there is indeed a	moral responsibility on man himself for his own soul's sake to respect	lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering but this viewpoint	schweitzer rejects	3207.39573420031
3244. so far as sacredness inheres	in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality	whether in lambarene africa or in washington dc	4418.523126308666
3245. one	cannot read the records of scientists officials and travelers who	have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing	that each individual met with is a person	3324.4772296100723
3246. read for instance	in	malcolm macdonald's borneo people of segura and her wise	father tomonggong koh and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization	3457.240782302776
3247. above all read in jens bjerre's the last cannibals	how the old man of the wailbri tribe in central australia	gave to the white man his choicest possession while the tears	streamed down his face	3755.0742603069384
3248. the australian aborigine is the conventional	exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth of sensibility	which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our	civilization	4840.911485111865
3249. persons whether white black brown or yellow	are a concern of god	643.3366491402529
3250. respect for personality is a privilege and a	duty for us as brothers	1189.1115713549482
3251. such is the field for exercising our	reverence	167.4854454353894
3252. as to our action let us align ourselves with the purpose	expressed by jesus in the lord's prayer: thy kingdom come	thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven	5184.03674047922
3253. with the knowledge	that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations	with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means	and the ends of our lives	3761.1358956743925
3254. this intellectual approach to spiritual	life suited me well because i was never content to lead a divided	life	2579.484327033463
3255. as i have said words from tennyson remain ever in my memory:	that mind and soul according well may make one music as	before	2468.505253279484
3256. let us now give some thought to the soul	393.88287432297125
3257. when the	young biologist dr ballard began to show interest in our daughter	elizabeth this induced a corresponding interest on our part in	him	2469.14329869517
3258. i asked one day what he was doing	250.58668311116418
3259. he told me that he had a big	newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the	big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto	the big newt	4309.6617584879405
3260. he was then noting that the big eye on the little newt	hung back until the little eye had grown up to it while the little	eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other	6430.492585688894
3261. then	i asked what does that teach you	167.5150342529509
3262. said he it teaches	me to wonder	139.55953413945
3263. this was a profound statement	14.74520027457288
3264. in the face	of the unfolding universe our ultimate attitude is that of wonder	1406.0047125153328
3265. wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world	375.2346956427275
3266. gone are the days when in the nineteenth century scientists thought	that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of	the physical universe	3879.9753316517226
3267. for them only a little more needed to be learned	and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted packaged	and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human	problem	3852.0981845796873
3268. this complacency was blown to bits by the relativity	of einstein the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the	discovery of the expanding universe	4262.209808526595
3269. none of these discoveries were	neatly rounded off bits of knowledge	499.4986965767296
3270. each faded out into the unexplored	areas of the future	562.9610271363707
3271. it is as if we in our center of human	observation from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown	2030.632111734994
3272. as our radius of penetration r increases the area of new	knowledge	increases by f and the total of human knowledge becomes measured	in terms of f	4244.690420395049
3273. there are	some people intelligent people who seem to be untouched by the sea	of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives	2966.1252332000977
3274. one	such is abraham meyer the writer of a recent book speaking of	man	1410.3993160621715
3275. this is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and	a vigorous defense of pure materialism	1265.7387000253702
3276. his inability to wonder vitiates	his argument	140.85571198597046
3277. the subject of immortality brings to mind a	vivid incident which took place in 1929 at montreux in switzerland	1733.1973206880255
3278. criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for	our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past	have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature	5804.504522035277
3279. i have chosen five	contrasting pairs ten men in all and they are arranged in roughly	chronological order	1569.2818267233752
3280. such a list must naturally be selective and the	treatment of each man is brief for i am interested only in their general	ideas on the moral measure of literature	4837.564546935018
3281. altogether the list	will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones	for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider	art above ethics all the way from plato to poe	3945.80168885086
3282. and most of the	great periods are represented because we will compare plato and aristotle	from the golden age of greece; stephen gosson and sir philip	sidney from renaissance england; dr johnson and william	hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england;	and james russell lowell and edgar allan poe of nineteenth	century american letters	8074.247502334324
3283. plato and aristotle	agree on some vital literary issues	263.16764347595984
3284. they both measure literature	by moral standards and in their political writings both allow for	censorship but the differences between them are also significant	3682.843234158509
3285. while	aristotle censors literature only for the young plato would banish	all poets from his ideal state	1425.3801615255857
3286. even more important in his poetics	aristotle differs somewhat from plato when he moves in the	direction of treating literature as a unique thing separate and apart	from its causes and its effects	5340.576339584497
3287. all through the republic	plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately	to a good life for his citizens	2460.5287265923953
3288. in short he is constantly concerned	with the ethical effects	562.654812015617
3289. when he discusses the subject matter	of poetry he asks what moral effect the scenes will have	1416.427791545602
3290. when he	turns briefly to literary style in the third book he again looks to	the effect on the audience	2834.991412507229
3291. he explains that his citizens must not	be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that	one finds in much poetry and he observes that all these pantomimic	gentlemen will be sent to another state	4113.287363047945
3292. only those story tellers	will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous	1415.087499225166
3293. plato is at times just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he	is of their work	1423.5969413176692
3294. when he discusses tyrants in the eighth book of	the republic he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst	rulers	3280.960070767327
3295. but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears	in the tenth book and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms	2472.4866399711836
3296. in plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the	poet and the philosopher because the poet imitates only particular objects	and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction much	less the highest level of ideal forms	6332.508453037292
3297. true reality of course is	the ideal and the poet knows nothing of this; only the philosopher	knows the truth	1903.1982750325853
3298. poets moreover dwell on human passions	65.20141561022648
3299. and	with this point about the passions we encounter plato's dualism	502.53737016328176
3300. the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both babbitt and	more that we must examine it in some detail	3478.9800947157732
3301. plato feels that man	has two competing aspects his rational faculty and his irrational	945.0426061551605
3302. we can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures the passions	in this case and strengthen our rational side; and poetry with all	its emphasis on the passions encourages the audience to give way to	emotion	6061.785193137082
3303. for this reason then poetry tends to weaken the power of	control the reason because it tempts one to indulge his passions and	even the best of men he maintains may be corrupted by this subtle	influence	3927.915113232362
3304. plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something	of an enigma because he is so completely sensitive to its charm	2839.6745159654956
3305. his whole objection indeed seems to rise out of a deep conviction	that the poets do have great power to influence but plato seldom	pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself	3735.8210024255886
3306. he is	rather concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets	to join his fight for justice	2813.047413853254
3307. he wants them to use their great power	to strengthen man's rational side to teach virtue and to encourage	religion	1880.619474244435
3308. while plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns	to the gods and famous men still he clearly leaves the way open for	further discussion of the issue	4284.862612790239
3309. he even calls upon the poets to defend	the muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue	1720.40744603261
3310. he says:	we	may further grant to those of her poetry's defenders	who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to	speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant	but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen	in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the	gainers- i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight	0.30166232349522504
3311. when we turn to aristotle's ideas on the moral measure	of literature it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned	about the influence of the art	3215.019730180135
3312. in the ideal state for instance	he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully	selected tales and stories	3304.8639840509777
3313. for this reason he would banish indecent	pictures and speeches from the stage; and the young people should	not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to	drink strong wine and sit at the public tables	4242.204100110817
3314. by the time they reach	that age however aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence	of comedies	2344.979916878945
3315. in aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the	poetics we find an attempt to isolate the art to consider only	those things proper to it to discover how it differs from other arts	and to deal with the effects peculiar to it	4290.55232995526
3316. he assures us early	in the poetics that all art is imitation and that all imitation	gives pleasure but he distinguishes between art in general and	poetic art on the basis of the means manner and the objects of the	imitation	6454.872759860077
3317. once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms	he lays down his famous definition of tragedy which sets up standards	and so lends direction to the remainder of the work	3446.4327557745573
3318. a tragedy by	his definition is an imitation of an action that is serious of a certain	magnitude and complete in itself	3283.1186568504236
3319. it should have a dramatic form	with pleasing language and it should portray incidents which so arouse	pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience	3000.1917381718226
3320. any	tragedy he maintains has six elements: plot character and thought	diction and melody	and spectacle	1886.3079821937706
3321. throughout the rest of	the poetics aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics	of these six	parts and their interrelationship and he refers frequently to the	standards suggested by his definition of tragedy	3457.9957061947134
3322. aristotle's	method in the poetics then does suggest that we should isolate	the work	1417.5458902054797
3323. the chicago contingent of modern critics follow aristotle	so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare	one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation	3418.081662522497
3324. but there are	however several features of aristotle's approach which open the	way for the moral measure of literature	2584.845760711034
3325. for one thing aristotle mentions	that plays may corrupt the audience	503.27328445229443
3326. in addition his definition	of a tragedy invites our attention because a serious and important	action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author	or of the characters	5318.758216362701
3327. and there is one other point in the poetics that	invites moral evaluation: aristotle's notion that the distinctive	function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity	and fear	3332.867745137801
3328. he rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to	that end	951.2183276244929
3329. the point is that an ethical critic with an assist from freud	can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with	a harmless outlet for our hostile urges	3340.4358527801596
3330. in his study samuel johnson	joseph wood krutch takes this line when he says that what aristotle	really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions	may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is less likely	that we shall indulge them through our own acts	7483.128434134534
3331. in krutch's view	this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without	employing the explicit methods of a moralist	2461.7242609119494
3332. and we can add that	krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to plato's	fear that poetry will encourage our passions	3266.7953052898824
3333. if krutch is correct	tragedy may have quite the opposite effect	500.45571599725355
3334. it may allay our passions	and so restore the rule of reason	962.6954259288866
3335. or in more freudian terms	the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen	the ego and superego	1880.1137270104668
3336. the second half of	the sixteenth century in england was the setting for a violent and long	controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially	the drama	4469.518294749348
3337. no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art	were irrelevant	637.5735292979094
3338. both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral	test but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or	a bad influence	4298.541965127797
3339. both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported	their cause	370.98718069924155
3340. those who wanted to close the theaters for example	pointed to plato's republic and those who wished to keep them	open called on the plato of the ion to testify in their behalf	5308.181219635618
3341. the most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps	sir philip sidney's an apologie for poetrie published	in 1595	2174.741174359456
3342. many students of literature know that classical defense	250.13371832263297
3343. what is not so well known however and what is quite important for	understanding the issues of this early quarrel is the kind of attack	on literature that sidney was answering	3312.4600995578758
3344. for this reason then i want	to describe first two examples of the puritanical attacks: stephen	gosson's the school of abuse 1579 and his later playes	confuted published in 1582	4811.061919914971
3345. second we will see how sidney	answered the charges for while sidney's essay was not specifically	a reply to gosson his arguments do support the new theater	2859.5665291881674
3346. according to william ringler's study stephen gosson the theater	business in london had become a thriving enterprise by 1577 and	in the opinion of many a thoroughly bad business	4683.292695130354
3347. aroused by what	they considered an evil influence some members of the clergy joined	by city authorities merchants and master craftsmen began the attack	on the plays and the actors for what they called the abuses of the	art but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of	acting	5132.993130792123
3348. although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from	some men who were not technically puritans still once the puritans	gained power they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance	of 1642 which decreed that all public stage-plays shall cease	and be forborne	6915.967705821415
3349. with that act of parliament the opponents of the	stage won the day and for more than two decades after that england	had no legitimate public drama	2871.053153586991
3350. in the early days of this controversy	over the theater one of the interested parties stephen gosson	published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses	of art rather than the art itself	5773.321800015111
3351. but his opposition hardened and	by 1579 in the school of abuse he was ready to banish all players	1722.1530021483784
3352. he advises women to beware of those places which in sorrows	cheere you and beguile you in mirth	2358.378165834514
3353. he does not really approve	of levity and laughter but sex is the deadly sin	1105.9187229011336
3354. he warns that	a single glance can lead us into temptation for looking eies have	lyking hartes and lyking hartes may burne in lust	3703.852394779272
3355. but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions	at the point just reached	1251.8670199488174
3356. fortunately it is possible to be somewhat	more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in	education	2563.378332920074
3357. for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and	psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities	and particularly from the cornell values studies	2867.2367725799127
3358. in the latter	research program	information is available for 2758 cornell students	surveyed in 1950 and for 1571 students surveyed in 1952	3270.4643451945617
3359. of the	latter sample 944 persons had been studied two years earlier; hence	changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals	at two points in time	3102.0051812712322
3360. in addition the 1952 study collected	comparable data from 4585 students at ten other colleges and universities	scattered across the country: dartmouth harvard yale wesleyan	north carolina fisk texas university of california at	los angeles wayne and michigan	6051.941871102271
3361. we find in the first	place that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education	positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing do not	accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the	public prints and on the whole approve of the way their university	deals with value-problems and value inculcation	5219.994448740193
3362. it is not our impression	that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful	ignorance; rather the generality of these students find their	university experience congenial to their own sense of values	5153.406634180769
3363. students	are approximately equally divided between those who regard	vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those	who chose a general liberal education	2864.691783192872
3364. other conceivable goals	such as character-education and social adjustment are of secondary	importance to them	1649.3548611924339
3365. the ideal of a liberal education impresses itself	upon the students more and more as they move through college	1738.4963928746242
3366. even	in such technical curricula as engineering the senior is much more	likely than the freshman to choose as an ideal liberal education over	specific vocational preparation	4320.231342483865
3367. in the university milieu of scholarship	and research of social diversity of new ideas and varied and	wide-ranging interests socialization into a campus culture apparently	means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education	in the arts and sciences	4207.081954604643
3368. students' choices of ideal	educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical	754.3022486224984
3369. there is a clear	relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic	pattern of general values	1251.6219890582274
3370. the selective and directional qualities of	basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data: the	success-oriented	students choose vocational preparation the other-directed	choose goals of social adjustment	the intellectuals choose a liberal arts emphasis	5505.08000633198
3371. the same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices	261.64440327673327
3372. there is impressive consistency between specific occupational	preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a	good way of life	3474.740321851785
3373. and contrary to many popular assertions the goal-values	chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic	success nor to mere conformity	2589.301076244876
3374. our students want occupations	that permit them to use their talents and training to be creative	and original to work with and to help other people	4077.253973952292
3375. they also want	money prestige and security	93.82375533034133
3376. but they are optimistic about their	prospects in these regards; they set limits to their aspirations-	few aspire to millions of dollars or to imperial power and	glory	4455.7841795618515
3377. within the fixed frame of these aspirations they can afford	to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of	occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power	prestige and wealth	3653.894575082007
3378. occupational choices are also useful-	and interesting- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute	the only component in goals and aspirations	3477.482211709703
3379. for there is also the	face of reality in the form of the individual's perceptions	of	his own abilities and interests of the objective possibilities open	to him of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed	4235.847103867014
3380. we find reluctant recruits whose values are not in line with	their expected occupation's characteristics	1638.2521064287967
3381. students develop occupational	images- not always accurate or detailed- and they try to	fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation	2450.837921370953
3382. the purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute	392.05956743208765
3383. furthermore many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands	or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity	or of ability and performance	2602.789278254132
3384. thus many a creativity-oriented aspirant	for a career in architecture drama or journalism resigns himself	to a real estate business; many a people-oriented student who dreams	of the md decides to enter his father's advertising agency;	and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were	better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice	it	8147.237565254662
3385. the old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant- but	so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy	2466.594757697077
3386. in their views on dating courtship sex and family	life our students prefer what they are expected to prefer	2589.6128514464917
3387. for them	in the grim words of a once-popular song love and marriage go together	like a horse and carriage	1906.0464661459632
3388. their expressed standards concerning	sex roles desirable age for marriage characteristics of an ideal mate	number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes	of the preceding generation- minus compulsive rebellion	5339.225635701501
3389. they	even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense	ie both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards	for women and women apply to both sexes a standard different from	that held by men	4225.809260973581
3390. conservatism and traditionalism	seem implied by what has just been said	754.4950581209937
3391. but these terms are treacherous	14.811548145411098
3392. in the field of political values it is certainly true that	students are not radical not rebels against their parents or their peers	3474.7490727430063
3393. and as they go through college the students tend to bring their	political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups	to which they belong	2845.673108591732
3394. yet they have accepted most of the extant welfare	state provisions for health security and the regulation of	economic affairs and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional	liberalism of the bill of rights	5318.573606018377
3395. when their faith in civil	liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific	issues eg suppression of dangerous ideas many waver	and give in	2854.2844533955094
3396. the students who are most willing to acquiesce in the	suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to	be prejudiced against minority groups to be conformist and traditionalistic	in general social attitudes and to lack a basic faith in people	6777.145803652789
3397. as one looks at the existing evidence one finds a correlation	although only a slight one between high grades and libertarian	values	2200.305779307909
3398. but the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen	252.93465729671317
3399. in other words as students go through college those who are	most successful academically tend to become more committed to a bill	of rights orientation	2590.9605163036294
3400. college in gross- just the general experience-	may have varying effects but the the students who are successful	emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values	3891.3823411008284
3401. this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are	more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties	than the other students	2979.262708060019
3402. there is now substantial evidence	from several major studies of college students that the experience of	the college years results in a certain selective homogenization of	attitudes and values	4673.2784265590835
3403. detached from their prior statuses and social	groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu	the students tend to assimilate a new common culture to converge	toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus	3945.9051569851376
3404. furthermore	in certain respects there are norms common to colleges and universities	across the country	1642.3962851780525
3405. for instance college-educated people consistently	show up in study after study as more often than others supporters	of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and liberties	2986.159721892925
3406. the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which	students tend to converge include toleration of diversity	2797.5242465359424
3407. to the extent that our sampling of the orientations of american college	students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our	culture- and still valid in 1959- we are disposed to question the	summary characterization of the current generation as silent beat	apathetic or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided	solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes	5737.2653838527085
3408. our data	indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing	institutions of the society and in the face of the realities of complex	and large-scale economic and political problems make a wary and	ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized	responsibility for coping with such collective concerns	7778.273151108883
3409. in	a real sense they are admittedly conservative but their conservatism	incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original radicalism	of 1776	2039.724569904798
3410. although we have no measures of its strength or intensity	the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained	2822.8318497428245
3411. as they move through the college years our young men and women are socialized	into a broadly similar culture at the level of personal	behavior	2609.8629698309546
3412. in this sense also they are surely conformists	250.2016908234936
3413. it is	even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity- everyone	does it- as a criterion for conduct	2168.9810989199623
3414. but the extent of	ethical robotism is easily overestimated	389.9460915137297
3415. few students are really so	faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our	institutions of higher learning	1878.204436648656
3416. and it may be well to recall that to	say	conformity is in part another way of saying orderly human	society	3005.8368071706122
3417. in the field of religious beliefs and values the	college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture	1574.3991532688767
3418. their commitments are for the most part couched in a familiar idiom	959.7629420388148
3419. students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate	personal philosophy	941.8925068290961
3420. avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as	to be a curiosity	963.4838738270703
3421. the religious quest is often intense and deep	and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with	the most profound questions of meaning and value	2986.395168963085
3422. at the same time	a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means	of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional	security	5032.036913243785
3423. these personal and social goals often overshadow the	goals of intellectual clarity and spiritual transcendence	1091.698339610489
3424. the cult	of adjustment does exist	65.71425052137364
3425. it exists alongside the acceptance of	traditional forms of organized religion		261.5310726006138
3426. still another segment of the student population consists	of those who seek in what they regard as religion intellectual clarity	rational belief and ethical guidance and reinforcement	4249.590236272327
3427. our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly	orthodox and religiously involved	1252.8337837197619
3428. upon second thought we were	forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks	against which we might compare the present situation and that conclusions	that present-day students are more or less religious	could not be defended on the basis of our data	6884.045758119259
3429. as we looked more intently	at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation	we received the impression that many of the religious convictions	expressed represented a conventional acceptance of low intensity	3768.863660250001
3430. but here again comparative benchmarks are lacking and we do not	know in any case what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect	from healthy young secure and relatively inexperienced persons;	after all feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions	of youth	6680.576734556154
3431. nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at	all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country	1404.1247088217829
3432. kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values	during a period of years primarily 1935-1955 but extending much farther	back in some instances	3672.6178917814045
3433. a variety of data are assembled to bear	upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality work-success	ethic individualism achievement lessened emphasis on future-time	orientation in favor of sociability moral relativism consideration and	tolerance conformity hedonistic present-time orientation	4039.188361531005
3434. although	he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion	and the alleged increase in conformity and thinks that hedonistic	present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed	to it he does conclude that americans increasingly enjoy leisure	without guilt do not stress achievement so much as formerly are more	accepting of group harmony as a goal more tolerant of diversity and	aware of other cultures	0.30166232349522504
3435. from new jersey morgan hastened to the headquarters of washington	at whitemarsh pennsylvania arriving there on november 18th	1553.241521456698
3436. there was much sickness in the corps and the men were in addition	without the clothing shoes and blankets needed for the winter weather	3682.6534173229275
3437. morgan himself had sciatica again	14.900910923313564
3438. even on his tough constitution	the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest	1885.0765337411303
3439. on the morning of november 17th cornwallis and 2000	men had left philadelphia with the object of capturing fort mercer	at red bank new jersey	2594.6424732774403
3440. in order to prevent this washington hastened	to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort including a force	under the marquis de lafayette containing some 160 of morgan's	riflemen all who were fit for duty at this time the rest having no shoes	6687.719789650386
3441. although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of cornwallis	morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing	at the redcoats	2977.6403865426205
3442. a picket guard of about 350 mostly hessians were	attacked by the americans under lafayette and driven back to their	camp some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire	5172.090161889271
3443. i never saw men lafayette declared in regard to the	riflemen so merry so spirited and so desirous to go on to the	enemy whatever force they might have as that small party in this fight	3857.408244953641
3444. nathanael greene told washington that lafayette was charmed	with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen	2109.631819602374
3445. a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an	attack upon the american camp	1567.86075921752
3446. the british general moved his forces	north from philadelphia to chestnut hill near the right wing of	the patriot encampment	2814.666945368597
3447. here the pennsylvania militia skirmished with	the british but soon fled	498.63925987066506
3448. morgan was ordered to attack the enemy	who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans	2828.92412676756
3449. similar orders were given to the maryland militia	166.19508505332308
3450. morgan immediately	disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait	1649.1934142545233
3451. a body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope a tempting	target for the riflemen who threw a volley into their ranks and messed	up the smart formation considerably	3344.54769313029
3452. now the riflemen and the	marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the british	giving them another telling round of fire	3483.9257122428453
3453. the redcoats ran like	rabbits	14.966352287467071
3454. but the maryland militia had likewise fled all too typical	of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which gave	morgan little confidence in militia in general as he watched other	instances of their breaking in hot engagements	6304.8811673242
3455. the british although	suffering considerable losses noted the defection of the marylanders	made a stand then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly	outnumbered and had to retire	2979.3861898641203
3456. the americans lost forty-four	men among them major joseph morris of morgan's regiment an	officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection not only by his	commander but by washington and lafayette as well	5636.753267236535
3457. the latter was	so upset on learning of the death of morris that he wrote morgan	a letter showing his own warmhearted generosity	2323.0809917040165
3458. after complimenting	morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to congress	too the ardent frenchman added he felt that congress should make	some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris but that	he	knew morgan realized how long such action usually required if it was	done at all	7673.966980140865
3459. as mrs morris may be in some want before that	time lafayette continued i am going to trouble you with a commission	which i beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy	3440.638111968617
3460. if	she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of	congress it would not become a stranger unknown to her to offer himself	for that purpose	4799.614167291615
3461. but you could tell her that	you had friends who being with the army don't know what to do with	their money and h would willingly let her have one or many thousand	dollars	3669.3917184635875
3462. this was accordingly done and the plight of the grateful	mrs morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan	the amount of which is not known	4650.043700616217
3463. apparently still sensitive	about the idea with which general gates had approached him at saratoga	namely that george washington be replaced morgan was vehement	in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around	philadelphia	3746.7024174068856
3464. richard peters secretary of the board of war thought	morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying	to pick a quarrel	4081.806664879076
3465. morgan hotly denied this and informed the board	of war that the men in camp linked the name of peters with the plot	against washington	2604.558590986583
3466. peters insisted that this impression was a great	misunderstanding and evidently from the quarrel obtained an unfavorable	impression of morgan's judgment	3055.6760021164255
3467. such a situation regarding	the board of war could hardly have helped morgan's chances for	promotion when that matter came before the group later on	2593.0610278694608
3468. in	late december the american army moved from whitemarsh to valley	forge and although the distance was only 13 miles the journey took	more than a week because of the bad weather the barefooted and almost	naked men	6075.130495293944
3469. the position of the new camp was admirably selected and	well fortified its easily defensible nature being one good reason why	howe did not attack it	2724.4861236822826
3470. besides helping to prevent the movement of	the british to the west valley forge also obstructed the trade between	howe's forces and the farmers thus threatening the vital subsistence	of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary	supplies extremely hazardous	6592.7702833451285
3471. in order to see that this hindering	situation remained effective washington detached several bodies of his	troops to the periphery of the philadelphia area	2459.872686239579
3472. morgan and	his corps were placed on the west side of the schuylkill river with	instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and	to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy	5921.650358252833
3473. the headquarters	of morgan was on a farm said to have been particularly well located	so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british a	practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for	british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency	4944.419906262143
3474. in his dealings with offenders however morgan was typically	firm but just	956.0808568397481
3475. for example he captured some persons from york county	who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man	who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife	and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household	goods	4758.796550959504
3476. morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its	thankful owners but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free	3696.973827538186
3477. morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him	for scouting duty most of them he said being useless	1880.4417944858146
3478. they straggle	at such a rate he told the commander-in-chief that if the	enemy were enterprising they might get two from us when we would take	one of them which makes me wish general howe would go on lest any	incident happen to us	6794.176954224791
3479. if the hardships of the winter at	valley forge were trying for healthy men they were of course much	more so for those not in good health	2835.388608712308
3480. daniel morgan's rheumatic condition	worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather	1407.1484927307436
3481. he	had braved the elements and the enemy but the strain aided by the winter	was catching up with him at last	2190.7078431218924
3482. also he was now forty-three	years old	141.81153052062976
3483. the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the	troops at valley forge could be handled by a subordinate he felt	so like henry knox equally loyal to washington who went to boston	at this time morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia	for several weeks	4923.336201465124
3484. in his absence the rifle regiment was under	the command of major thomas posey another able virginian	2116.359916013701
3485. but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william	pickman in salem massachusetts apparently an acquaintance praising	washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were	opposed by the general current of the people h to exalt general	gates at the expense of general washington was injurious to the latter	5316.833666284511
3486. if there be a disinterested patriot in america 'tis general	washington and his bravery none can question	2126.219875281717
3487. it is doubtful	if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children	for his pay as shown by the war department abstracts of early	1778 was $75 a month as a colonel and that apt to be delayed	4448.04698195717
3488. he	was shown a warm welcome regardless and spent the time in winchester	recuperating from his ailment enjoying his family and arranging his	private affairs which were of course run down	4989.461617590715
3489. his neighbors celebrated	his return even if it was only temporary and morgan was especially	gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend isaac	lane who told him a man that has so often left all that is dear	to him as thou hast to serve thy country must create a sympathetic	feeling in every patriotic heart	5408.988703002525
3490. there must have been special	feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of daniel morgan too	when the news was received on april 30th of the recognition by france	of the independence of the united states	5902.44118693894
3491. his fellow virginian	george washington had stated i believe no event was ever received	with more heartfelt joy	1573.9778494403986
3492. the dreary camp at valley forge	was turned into an arena of rejoicing	1180.5347400395285
3493. even the dignified washington	indulged in a game of wickets with some children	791.2051282360541
3494. his soldiers on the	whole did not celebrate so mildly	560.5123558471776
3495. on may 6th morgan who had returned	received from washington orders to send out patrols under	vigilant officers to keep near the enemy	2318.1108202211262
3496. the reason for this	the orders said is that the enemy may think to take advantage of	the celebration of this day	3265.1150421658376
3497. the troops must have more than the common	quantity of liquor and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness	among them	2020.460794801576
3498. apparently no serious disorders resulted from	the celebration and within a few days morgan joined the force of	lafayette who now had command of some 2000 men at barren hill not	far above philadelphia on the schuylkill	5938.173498794907
3499. the frenchman had been	ordered to approach the enemy's lines harass them and get intelligence	of their movements	1566.1001356671973
3500. interestingly enough the order transmitted	to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that a party	of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at whitemarsh	and act with them	5462.6613842947845
3501. washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be cautious as well	as aggressive for on may 17th 18th and 20th he admonished the leader	of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert	3442.7991819920508
3502. obviously the commander-in-chief	had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence	too for on the 23rd of may he told morgan that the british were	prepared to move perhaps in the night and asked morgan to have two	of his best horses ready to dispatch to general smallwood with the	intelligence obtained	7702.766109551159
3503. meantime however this same general smallwood	seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the american army	1415.2305468081966
3504. colonel	benjamin ford wrote to morgan from wilmington that he understood	a mrs sanderson from maryland had obtained permission from smallwood	to visit philadelphia and would return on may 26th escorted	by several officers from maryland belonging to the new levies	in the british service	6924.136434967161
3505. ford urged morgan to capture these men	who he thought might be disguised as quakers or peasants	1419.9544116746104
3506. morgan took	the suggested steps but when mrs sanderson appeared there was	nobody with her but her husband whom he promptly sent to headquarters	to be questioned	4247.598759594231
3507. but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence	much more important to his commanding general	943.9901331234978
3508. a letter of a	few days later from washington's aide to morgan stated his excellency	is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion	3675.2416997162736
3509. for by now the original cause of the quarrel philip's seizure of	gascony was only one strand in the spider web of french interests that	overlay all western europe and that had been so well and closely	spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to	the other	5081.297300267332
3510. even so edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen	that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace	was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that	left england for rome during that period had very little to do with	it	7092.790056529088
3511. it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures	on the pope	1252.3263955032385
3512. nogaret is hardly an impartial witness and even he	did	not make his charges against boniface until the latter was dead but	there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say	6035.946284316546
3513. it was not merely a hunger for money gold and precious objects	that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war	to an end; the pope was playing a dangerous game with so many balls	in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears	and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage	of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs	0.20124717349522497
3514. when the	negotiations began his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily	in abeyance and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there	was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who under	charles of valois	the papal vicar of tuscany were so valuable in	the crusade against the colonna cardinals and their sicilian allies	8387.934306301333
3515. if his circumspection in regard to philip's sensibilities went so	far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of	amadee's daughter agnes to the son of the dauphin of vienne-	a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas for savoy	and dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides- for fear	that he might seem to be favoring the anti-french coalition he would	certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return	of gascony to edward even though as he admitted to the english	ambassadors he had been advised that the original cession was invalid	0.20124717349522497
3516. on the other hand he did not want to offend edward either and	he found himself in a very difficult position	3026.118564833673
3517. on the surface the whole	question was purely feudal	261.54854153317876
3518. the french were now occupying gascony	and flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited	them by a breach of the feudal contract	3906.160561052527
3519. but edward was invading	scotland for precisely the same reason and his insubordinate vassal	was the ally of the king of france	2173.9528532170307
3520. boniface had to uphold the sacredness	of the feudal contract at all costs for it was only as suzerain	of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he had any justification	for his italian wars but in the english-scottish-french triangle	it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one	of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other	two	8650.013886508128
3521. because of these involvements in the matter at stake boniface	lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification	for the position of arbiter and in retrospect that would	seem to be	sufficient reason why the english embassies to the curia proved	so fruitless	4687.320005438518
3522. but when the situation was so complicated that even	nogaret one of the principal actors in the drama could misinterpret	the pope's motives it is possible that othon and his companions	equally baffled attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause	6467.415062401973
3523. this was boniface's monumental tactlessness	14.848877833951855
3524. tact by	its very derivation implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other	people but the author of clericis laicos and unam sanctam	the wielder of the two swords the papal sun of which the imperial	moon was but a dim reflection the peer of caesar and vice-regent	of christ was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten	what they were like	8678.549230622612
3525. he was a learned and brilliant man one of the	best jurists in europe and with flashes of penetrating insight and yet	in his dealings with other people particularly when he tried to be	ingratiating he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come	only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives	5366.452615370162
3526. this lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men	as pierre flotte and his associates that brilliant group of mediocre	men as powicke calls them who provided the brains for the	french embassy that came to rome under the nominal leadership of the	archbishop of narbonne the duke of burgundy and the count of st-pol	8024.938669020866
3527. they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence	and astuteness they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles	like othon or even the older generation of clerks like hotham and	they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized	4693.265202089027
3528. boniface was later to explain to the english that robert	of burgundy and guy de st-pol were easy enough to do business with;	it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say	that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing	with them he never knew whether he had to do with a frenchman or	with a devil	8675.851615967822
3529. to the pope head of the universal church to the duke	of burgundy taking full advantage of his position on the borders	of france and of the empire or to othon who found it quite natural	that he should do homage to edward for tipperary and to the count	of savoy for grandson flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely	incomprehensible	5462.006403270511
3530. and yet he made no pretense about it; when	the pope trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature said to him	you have already taken normandy	4465.8436163657625
3531. do you want to drive the king	of england from all his overseas possessions	941.2939379332729
3532. the frenchman's	answer was a terse vous dites vrai	393.81099168645886
3533. loyal and unscrupulous	with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies he	outmatched the english diplomats time and time again until by a kind	of poetic justice he fell at the battle of courtrai the victim of	the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings	4754.343093811877
3534. the	english relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior	diplomatic skill were also hampered in their negotiations by the events	that were taking place at home	4465.604818670486
3535. the scots had found a new leader	in william wallace and edward's yearly expeditions across the border	called for evermounting taxes which only increased his difficulties	with the barons and the clergy	3461.8308595057583
3536. he was unable to send any more	help to his allies on the continent and during the next few years many	of them left to resist french pressure unaided surrendered to the	inevitable and made their peace with philip	6176.746312552174
3537. the defeat and death	of adolf	of nassau at the hands of albert of habsburg also worked to	the disadvantage of the english for all the efforts to revive the	anti-french coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with	the new king of the romans	4754.80990778337
3538. these shifts in alliance and	allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the english	embassy as a whole but also directly involved the two savoyards amadee	and othon	4497.653611452627
3539. in spite of the armistice negotiated by amadee two	years earlier the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis	of savoy was still going on and although little is known about	it that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle	against french expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict	5289.79126284988
3540. a second truce had been arbitrated in april 1298 by jean	d'arlay lord of chalon-sur-saone the most staunch of	edward's	burgundian allies and these last were represented in the discussions	at the curia by gautier de montfaucon othon's neighbor and a	member of the vaudois coalition	7023.671273273411
3541. but although in many of these	discussions othon and amadee might have been tempted to consider	their own interests as well as those of the king edward's confidence	in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders	of the embassy	4457.559984815946
3542. amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship	with the king but othon who at sixty seems still to have been a simple	knight merited his position solely by his own character and ability	5626.154167785415
3543. the younger men vere and pembroke who was also edward's	cousin and whose lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that	caused edward of carnarvon's irreverent friend piers gaveston	to nickname him joseph the jew were relatively new to the game	of diplomacy but pontissara had been on missions to rome before	and hotham a man of great learning jocund in speech agreeable	to meet of honest religion and pleasing in the eyes of all and an	archbishop to boot was as reliable and experienced as othon himself	0.20124717349522497
3544. but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two savoyards	were the heads of it for they were the only ones who were empowered	to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision	and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably	absent	7833.863259947802
3545. this also gave them the unpleasant duty of	being spokesmen for the mission and they could foresee that that would	not be easy	2328.5998948038696
3546. underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and	papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys	was the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert his flemish	allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain	the king of france in return for being given an equally free hand	with the insubordinate scots	8179.5745827245355
3547. this was a doubly bitter blow to the	king	262.0403752670272
3548. in the eyes of those who still cared for such things it was	a reflection on his honor and it gave further grounds for complaint to	his overtaxed subjects who were already grumbling- although probably	not in latin- non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana	7083.901996018499
3549. bad relations between england and flanders brought hard times to the	shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded	flemish cities and while the english so far had done no more than	grumble othon had seen what the discontent might lead to for before	he left the low countries the citizens of ghent had risen in protest	against the expense of supporting edward and his troops and the	regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the	nasty little riot that ensued	0.20124717349522497
3550. in all the talk of feudal rights	the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers nor was	it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they passed the florentine	pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from england	and rough flemish cloth the former to be spun and woven by the	arte della lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the arte	della calimala with the pigment recently discovered in asia minor	by one of their members bernardo rucellai the secret of which they	jealously kept for themselves	0.30166232349522504
3551. these chatty merchants made amusing and	instructive traveling companions for their business took them to all	four corners of the globe and florentine gossip had already reached	a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the inferno	will prove	4409.959501120019
3552. a northern ambassador willing to keep his mouth shut	and his ears open could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead	at the curia	4307.208388795017
3553. they had other topics of conversation besides	their news from courts and fairs which were of interest to othon	the builder of castles in wales and churches in his native country	3326.092428958752
3554. behind him lay the low countries where men were still completing	the cathedrals that a later florentine would describe as a malediction	of little tabernacles one on top of the other with so many pyramids	and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all	for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble;	the low countries where the middle ages were to last for	another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy	met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls	of grandson	0.30166232349522504
3555. it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right	people or there were only a few wrong people in the town	2601.5091032549685
3556. alfred wanted	to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build	a larger place	2122.761281063448
3557. it was a very tempting offer	43.90458841761851
3558. my father would have done	it if it hadn't been for my mother who had a fear of being in debt	to anyone- even alfred alpert	4092.988402119844
3559. in spite of his being well	liked there were a few people who were very careful about alfred	1565.8697278822601
3560. they had my mother's	opinion of him: that he was too sharp or a little	too good to be true	2820.285076167661
3561. one of the people who was afraid of alfred	was his own brother lew	937.1833800878385
3562. i don't know how and i don't know why	but the two stores the one in margaretville and the one in fleischmanns	that had been set up as a partnership were dissolved separated	from each other	5797.050572431171
3563. everything was all very friendly except when it came	to harry the youngest brother	944.7419836778869
3564. alfred who was a good deal older	than harry had treated him like a son and when harry decided to stay	in business with lew instead of going with alfred alfred looked	on the decision as a betrayal	6097.292179325805
3565. from that day on he never spoke to harry	or to lew or to lew's two boys mort and jimmy	1888.6620061176436
3566. the six	miles between the towns became an ocean and the alperts became a family	of strangers	2121.142813462963
3567. time went on and everybody got older	94.49984986342993
3568. i became	fifteen sixteen then twenty and still tessie alpert sat on the	porch with a rose in her hair and alfred got richer and sicker with	diabetes	4482.890241576135
3569. it was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and	tessie and alfred found out that they didn't know each other	2724.941763805019
3570. they	were like two strangers	22.167385068034733
3571. the store was their marriage and when	alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together	1720.5537620539712
3572. tessie	everybody thought was a strong woman but she was only strong because	she had alfred to lean on	2587.5577771399307
3573. and when alfred was forced into his	bed tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home rocking	in her rocker in the living room staring out the window- the rose	still in her hair	4037.4135736498256
3574. tessie could do nothing for alfred	65.1789996477697
3575. she couldn't	cook or clean or make him comfortable	263.23685788502854
3576. instead she waited for alfred	to get better and take care of her	1172.0349204791357
3577. spring was life- and	alfred alpert in his sickroom was death	502.651531488894
3578. i remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he	could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't	3685.8049463941957
3579. alfred	began to put his affairs in order and he went about it like a man	putting his things into storage	2036.6033100045927
3580. my father who liked alfred very much	was a constant visitor	756.1465655023462
3581. one day alfred told him that he had decided	to leave everything to me	934.4881558758085
3582. my father a wise man asked him not	to	388.23252702050405
3583. he knew alfred liked me; if he wanted to leave me something let	it be a trinket nothing else	1718.169184161178
3584. by leaving me everything he wouldn't	be doing me a favor my father told him and he didn't want to see	his daughter involved in a lawsuit	4281.920127710908
3585. he didn't want alfred to leave	me trouble because that's all it would be and alfred understood	1410.2865446790981
3586. alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home	754.0560843870819
3587. the doctor	wanted him in a hospital; the nearest one was forty miles away	in kingston	1259.7242516282001
3588. the day alfred left his home and fleischmanns he gave	up the convictions of a lifetime	1885.7233432145483
3589. he sent me for meltzer the butcher	whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi	1584.195087746914
3590. meltzer knew	why i had come for him	251.71437765219903
3591. solemnly he walked me back to alfred's	house without a word passing between us	939.9257638995217
3592. he entered the house in silence	walked into alfred's room and closed the door behind him	1895.5186853214043
3593. i	sat down to wait and i watched tessie alpert who hadn't moved	or said a word but kept staring out of the window	2467.488727684787
3594. for a few minutes	there was nothing to hear	389.4531148933519
3595. then meltzer's voice quiet calm	strong started the kaddish the prayer for the dead	946.5081702210767
3596. i could hear	alfred's voice a few words behind meltzer's like a counterpoint	punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation	2837.5419389392673
3597. there was a finality	in the rhythm of the prayer- it was the end of a life the end of hope	and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning	3335.2498228403506
3598. meltzer stayed with alfred and when the door opened they both came	out	1178.8984957998402
3599. alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital	262.32759419720367
3600. the car was	waiting for him	65.1630508894675
3601. alfred leaning on meltzer stopped for a minute to	look at tessie	641.8173693635451
3602. she didn't turn away from the window	142.152116125248
3603. alfred nodded	a little nod and went out through the door	498.1719905026681
3604. outside his brother	harry was waiting for him- he had come to say good-bye	1417.6048898559502
3605. alfred	walked past him without a word and got into the car	649.8958685229087
3606. harry ran to	the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him begging	him to speak	2831.0205334369457
3607. the car began to move	and harry ran after it crying alfred! alfred! speak to me	1254.3189651038608
3608. but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead	760.6065147898491
3609. harry	followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards	kingston	949.1602304202695
3610. he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight	752.0903886332713
3611. i went to visit alfred in the kingston hospital a few times	642.2839295341013
3612. the first time i went there he asked me to bring him water from	flagler's well- water that reminded him of his first days in the	mountains- and before i came the next time i filled a five-gallon	jug for him and brought it to the hospital	7124.34505371914
3613. i don't think he ever	got to drink any of it	497.6037314937178
3614. the jug stayed at the hospital and the	water- what can happen to water	1412.5628365482755
3615. - it evaporated disappeared and	came back to the earth as rain- maybe for another well or another	stream or another alfred alpert	1457.7519895800428
3616. mr banks was always called banks the butcher until he left	town and the shop passed over to meltzer the scholar who then became	automatically meltzer the butcher	4466.07989402312
3617. meltzer was a boarder with the	banks family	167.43072499697882
3618. he came to fleischmanns directly from the boat that	brought him to america from russia	1664.42110203991
3619. he was a learned man and a very	gentle soul	378.47666951582585
3620. he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the talmud	754.3080654945871
3621. he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak very weak	on the therefores	1253.5894422068625
3622. banks the butcher took meltzer the scholar	as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must	be able to do more than just quote the commentaries of the talmud in	order to live	6211.321720355476
3623. so meltzer learned a new trade from banks who supplied	the town and the hotels with meat	1417.234099171945
3624. banks had a family-	a wife a daughter and a son	757.732768325042
3625. the daughter lilly was a very good	friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would	find each other	2465.8276288788475
3626. they lived in the same house and it didn't seem	to be such a hard	thing to do but the sad realities of lilly's life	and the fact that meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful	thinking	6053.017954096633
3627. banks the butcher was a hard master and a hard	father a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living	flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade	3850.8653940413997
3628. he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt;	perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that	hung silently from his hooks	4447.370978116665
3629. lilly banks and i became friends	43.67243911155968
3630. she was the opposite of everything she should have been- a positive	pole in a negative home a living reaction of warmth and kindness	to the harsh reality of her father	5001.970189228603
3631. and lilly's whole family seemed	to be an apology for mr banks	637.1920170822467
3632. her brother karl was a very gentle	soul her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard	probing eyes	3472.18865299037
3633. for every rude word of mr banks's the family	had five in apology	790.0955342234695
3634. every chance i got i left the hotel to	visit lilly	754.8059964047201
3635. i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even	the coming of meltzer lightened	1565.921696153308
3636. she had to clean the glass on the	display cases in the butcher shop help her brother scrub the cutting	tables with wire brushes mop the floors put down new sawdust on the	floors and help check the outgoing orders	6342.355905183472
3637. when these chores were	finished only then was she allowed whatever freedom she could find	1098.3048771016022
3638. i helped lilly in the store	65.06859971300572
3639. to me it was a game to her it	was the deadly seriousness of life	1094.9368070876612
3640. i wanted to help so that we could	find time to play	956.300401471212
3641. and lilly allowed me to help so that she could	have her few little hours of escape	1400.619102485602
3642. when the work was finished	we would walk	251.5055310018808
3643. the road past the butcher shop took us along the side	of a stream	944.9691956846469
3644. it ran north away from the town and the people through	woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard	2602.9574100280415
3645. lilly preferred	the loneliness of that walk	93.27313402259975
3646. i would have liked the town and the	busyness of its people but i always followed lilly into the peace of	the silent and unstaring road	4116.735554743607
3647. it wasn't hard to understand	14.828730013549324
3648. to me lilly was a fine and lovely girl	394.5757277188196
3649. to people who didn't know	her she was a gawky badly dressed kid whose arms were too long whose	legs were a little too bony	2593.750703450186
3650. she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed	walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the	street	3483.2765524002834
3651. and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked	372.1467911020519
3652. it was	unexpected unexpected because lilly walked with her head bent down	down and her mark of friendship was to look into your face	3679.5512681047503
3653. i accepted	her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness; childishness compared	to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as	yet undisclosed sins	2714.7271476225533
3654. we were almost the same age she was fifteen	i was twelve and where i felt there was a life to look forward to lilly	felt she had had as much of it as was necessary	5781.393762217222
3655. when we	went for our walks lilly's brother would come along every once in	a while	1255.6911003305645
3656. karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it	was strange to see the expected become the unexpected	3035.223086812977
3657. this huge hulk	played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play	for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream	3229.5216453129697
3658. karl played well	and his favorite song was a schubert lullaby	758.0748757026843
3659. he spoke no german	but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew	in a foreign language	2605.5441483674153
3660. the song he said was called the stream's	lullaby and when he sang gute ruh gute ruh mach't	die augen zu there was such longing and such simple sadness that	it frightened me	5305.984472163514
3661. later when i was older i found the song was part	of schubert's die scho^ne mu^llerin	1252.8923159783526
3662. and even hearing	it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and	the melody would make me a little colder and i would reach out for my	husband's hand	5324.46662018763
3663. the brother and sister seemed to be a sort	of mutual-aid society a little fortress of kindness for each other in	a hard world	2460.9711743313337
3664. i felt very flattered to be included in the protection	of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from	3262.4670187319653
3665. the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decades	preceeding and following it marks a great change in the history of	early english scholarship	2988.008353972799
3666. at the bottom of this change were great strides	forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the	historian	2806.7274994418954
3667. in archaeology for example the contributions of frederick	haverfield and reginald smith to the various volumes of the victoria	county histories raised the discipline from the status of an	antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the	early english historian	4533.409841130745
3668. and with the publication of e t leeds'	archaeology of the anglo-saxon settlements the student	was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data	then known	4280.058062519136
3669. what was true for archaeology was also true of place-name	studies	500.40805389676336
3670. the value of place-names in the reconstruction of early	english history had long been recognized	1640.7761613867922
3671. place-names in fact	had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of camden	onwards	1258.9220500720571
3672. without a precise knowledge of germanic philology however	it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion	and error than anything else	4281.227362399903
3673. even in the nineteenth century	such accomplished philologists as kemble and guest were led into what	now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that	modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical	philological development	4275.085839144465
3674. it was therefore not until the publication	of jh round's the settlement of the south and east	saxons and wh stevenson's dr guest and the english	conquest of south britain that a scientific basis for place-name	studies was established	6183.256762913987
3675. diplomatic is another area for	which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern	standards of scholarship	1881.0326271546487
3676. although because of the important achievements	of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism	the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology	and place-names the editorial principles laid down by stevenson in	his great edition of asser and in his crawford charters were a	distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved	upon today	8543.092624266395
3677. in sum it can be said that the techniques and	standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century	2331.108850484984
3678. and it is this particularly the establishment of archaeology and	place-name studies on a scientific basis which are immediately pertinent	to the saxon shore	3694.3184346843736
3679. almost inevitably the first result	of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and	in many cases the conclusions of the oxford school of stubbs freeman	and green regarding the nature of the anglo-saxon	conquest of britain	4131.018162361007
3680. even before the century was out the tide of	reaction had set in	1179.7145061590156
3681. charles plummer in the introduction and notes to	his splendid edition of bede voiced some early doubts concerning the	elaborate superstructure they raised up over the slim foundations	afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest	3864.4602445637515
3682. it was plummer	in fact who coined the much quoted remark: mr green	indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the saxons	and had watched every step of their subsequent progress	5813.5645343930355
3683. sir henry	howorth writing in 1898 put himself firmly in the lappenburg-kemble	tradition by attacking the veracity of the west saxon annals	2176.0094628821143
3684. early in the present century w h stevenson continued	the attack with a savage article against guest	2130.806309300079
3685. following him in varying	degrees of scepticism were tw shore hm chadwick	thomas hodgkin and f g beck	1564.9760727666987
3686. by 1913 ferdinand lot	could begin an article subtitled la conquete de la grande-bretagne	par les saxons with the words il est difficile aujourd	'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel	de la conquete de la grande-bretagne h	6456.053651448884
3687. it is also worthy	of note that lot cited both kemble and lappenberg with favor in	that article	1565.9236133004647
3688. it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle	562.130932596476
3689. in fact modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated	all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the	nineteenth century	2868.4760402161273
3690. although one meets with occasional extremists like	zachrisson or very recently arthur wade-evans the majority of	scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism	and gullibility	4668.001021039735
3691. most now admit that bede gildas nennius and	the anglo-saxon chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early	english history that guest freeman and green thought them to be	3080.6900115128756
3692. as rh hodgkin has remarked: the critical methods of	the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque narrative	2364.40796650786
3693. on	the other hand the consensus of opinion is that used with caution	and in conjunction with other types of evidence the native sources still	provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern	britain	3941.3510131549556
3694. as sir charles oman once said it is no longer fashionable	to declare that we can say nothing certain about old english	origins	3497.475672353548
3695. therefore in one way kemble and lappenberg	have been vindicated	374.33530491813156
3696. their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness	of the west saxon annals the confused chronology of bede the	unreliability of the early positions of the anglo-saxon genealogies	and the mythological elements contained in nennius are now mostly accepted	5791.1126023213865
3697. nevertheless in another way modern historians still labor in	the vineyard of the oxford school	1093.9760674293411
3698. for it is their catastrophic concept	of the anglo-saxon invasions rather than kemble's gradualist	approach which dominates the field	2596.8587632006297
3699. despite the rejection of the traditional	accounts on many points of detail as late as 1948 it was still	possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden	influx of germans as the type of invasions	3762.1887629094454
3700. at	this point of course the issue has become complicated by a development	unforeseen by lappenberg and kemble	2367.5172003002735
3701. they however much they were	in disagreement with the late victorians over the method by which	britain was germanized agreed with them that the end result was the	complete extinction of the previous celtic population and civilization	3940.7024093271743
3702. but beginning for all practical purposes with frederick seebohm's	english village community scholars have had to reckon	with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between	roman and anglo-saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning	concept of the anglo-saxon invasions	6688.876548754646
3703. against seebohm formidable	foes have taken the field notably f w maitland whose	domesday book and beyond was written expressly for this purpose	and sir paul vinogradoff whose the growth of the manor had	a similar aim	3946.7145157958817
3704. largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory	has maintained its position although seebohm has always found	supporters	2375.3569979849353
3705. hl gray in his english field systems and	zachrisson's romans kelts and saxons defended in part the	seebohm thesis while at the present time hpr finberg and	gordon copley seem to fall into the celtic survivalist camp	3947.441767477877
3706. this	is nevertheless a minority view	65.78973380009026
3707. most scholars while willing to accept	a survival of celtic art forms and a considerable proportion	of the celtic population reject any institutional legacy from	pre-anglo-saxon britain	2848.639434447538
3708. therefore it is plain that the	clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us	2124.263582077319
3709. in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars hm	chadwick rh hodgkin sir frank stenton et al	who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest	but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by	them	4609.787846947116
3710. they in effect have compromised the opposing positions of the	nineteenth century	963.9885704148974
3711. on the other side are the celtic survivalists who	have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century	thought	2189.741562286527
3712. as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual	germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of	their work eg seebohm gray and finberg tends to obscure	their sympathies	5319.8580490364
3713. those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions	in a more general way like tw shore and arthur wade-evans	are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful germanic penetration	into britain	3784.0702670155924
3714. wade-evans in fact denies that there were any anglo-saxon	invasions at all other than a minor jutish foray in ad	514	3022.8170253060584
3715. now omitting for a moment some recent developments	we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of lappenberg and kemble has	undergone virtual eclipse in this century	2736.951754572321
3716. it is no longer possible	to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the	invasions almost automatically produces a shore occupied by interpretation	4115.9064334476525
3717. everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has	been willing to accept lappenberg or kemble's position on that	point	2186.907853173141
3718. one reason is of course that the new scepticism has been willing	to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in	the traditional sources	4099.011092854979
3719. the few scholars who have adopted the shore	occupied by interpretation howorth shore and wade-evans	have all been celtic survivalists	1880.7932062632299
3720. moreover they have done so in rather	special circumstances	392.3399883068454
3721. the primary reason for the abandonment	of the shore occupied by thesis has been the assimilation and	accumulation of archaeological evidence the most striking feature	of early english studies in this century	3440.7603252408835
3722. again omitting recent developments	et	leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged: so far	as archaeology is concerned there is not the least warrant for the	second of these theories	4839.609672058935
3723. even earlier haverfield	had come to the same conclusion	261.96996340249194
3724. what they meant was that there	was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of britain received	germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of	england	4830.868725893879
3725. that is there was no trace of anglo-saxons in britain	as early as the late third century to which time the archaeological	evidence for the erection of the saxon shore forts was beginning to	point	3755.7532663645047
3726. in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology therefore it	became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the shore settled	by theory	3905.8586305371914
3727. in recent years however a wind of change	seems to be blowing through early english historical circles	1407.7719507416653
3728. the	great increase in the amount of archaeological activity and therefore	information in the years immediately preceeding and following the second	world war has brought to light data which has changed the complection	of the saxon shore dispute	6069.394416846462
3729. where there were none fifteen years	ago several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards	the acceptance of the shore occupied by position	2475.5635095932525
3730. we must	therefore have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine	the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem	3480.2128101044786
3731. what exactly are we trying to prove	93.72818667005455
3732. we know that the	saxon shore was a phenonenon of late roman defensive policy; in	other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain	4085.8550355065645
3733. so	whenever the romans finally withdrew from the island the saxon shore	disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century	2055.083935616449
3734. we also know	that the saxon shore as reflected in the notitia was created	as a part of the theodosian reorganization of britain		2352.763927243492
3735. my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that	time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of carausius	2714.6001268610717
3736. therefore what we must prove or disprove is that there were	saxons in the broad sense in which we must construe the word in	the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore	6171.545574997793
3737. that is we must find saxons in east anglia kent sussex and	hampshire in the last half of the fourth century	2022.2029083378904
3738. the problem	in other words is strictly a chronological one	568.5560595329229
3739. in gaul the saxon	element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the	saxons were an intrusive element in the population	2309.8186726336517
3740. in britain obviously	the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the saxon	shore region are bound to be saxon	2346.281400037483
3741. it is a matter of trying to	sort out an earlier fourth-century saxon element from the later fifth-century	mainstream of anglo-saxon invasions	2178.327404377228
3742. this naturally will	be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence	in this period with some fortunate exceptions is insufficient	for precise chronological purposes	4272.014080176042
3743. it might be well to consider	the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer	to one important question; namely is the idea that there were saxon	mercenaries in england at all reasonable	3837.984035702516
3744. to do so something was necessary beyond volunteering because there was	little glamour or romance in the european war; it meant instead	hardship dirt and death	4077.325668766919
3745. baker gave leonard wood credit for	the initiation of the draft of soldiers; from the general's idea	a chain reaction occurred	2031.7008567159824
3746. wood took the proposal to chief of staff	hugh l scott who passed it on to baker a month before the actual	declaration of war against germany	4253.712350802347
3747. the secretary of war gave	his assent after studying the history of the draft in the american	civil war as well as the british volunteer system in world war 1	3220.16891602819
3748. he concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization	of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable	moral effects of the british reliance on enlistment only- where	the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning	white feathers on reluctant young men orators preaching hate of the	germans and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist	out of motives of revenge and retaliation	0.30166232349522504
3749. baker took the plan	to wilson who said: baker this is plainly right on any ground	1249.04159498342
3750. start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if i am obliged	to go to congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration	3700.1847657188796
3751. the result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually	ready long before the country knew that the device was to take	the place of the volunteering method which theodore roosevelt favored	3532.2759047238565
3752. before the draft act was passed baker had confidentially briefed	governors sheriffs and prospective draft board members on the administration	of the measure- and the confidence was kept so well that	only one newspaper learned what was going on	6217.72526185358
3753. it was baker working	through provost marshal enoch crowder and major hugh s	johnson who arranged for a secret printing by the	million of selective service blanks- again before the act was passed-	until corridors in the government printing office were full	and the basement of the washington post office was stacked to the ceiling	5261.243588330044
3754. general crowder proposed that regular army officers select	the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation; it was baker	who thought of lessening the shock which conscription always brings	to a country by substituting greetings from your neighbors for	the recruiting sergeant and registration in familiar voting places	rather than at military installations	7772.024658669316
3755. even so the draft act	encountered rough sledding in its progress through the congress	938.9014016568326
3756. democratic	speaker champ clark saw little difference between a conscript	and a convict	1181.655588736537
3757. democrat stanley h dent chairman of the	house military affairs committee declined to introduce the bill	1253.016653593492
3758. democratic floor leader claude kitchin would have no part of the	measure	965.0934881454237
3759. in the judgment of chief of staff scott it was ironic that	the draft policy of a democratic president aimed at germany had	to be pushed through the house of representatives by the ranking minority	member of the military affairs committee- a republican jew	born in germany! he was julius kahn for whom the chief of staff	thought no honor could be too great	5686.687394426056
3760. after kahn's death in 1924	scott wrote: may he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude	of his adopted country	2799.119521252748
3761. in spite of powerful opposition the	draft act finally passed congress on may 17 1917	1096.8257368289733
3762. in early june	ten million young men registered by name and number	967.4003127708027
3763. the day passed	without incident in spite of the warning of senator james a reed	of missouri: baker you will have the streets of our american	cities running with blood on registration day	3545.5533321339053
3764. on july 20 the	first drawing of numbers occurred in the senate office building before	a distinguished group of congressmen and high army officers	3695.7866822268707
3765. secretary	of war baker blindfolded put his hand into a large glass	bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called	2313.6849059257383
3766. a man in mississippi wired: thanks for drawing 258- that's	me	752.4282072315834
3767. he was the first of 2800000 called to the army through the	selective service system	1097.2701591851746
3768. it was one thing to call men to the	colors; it was another to house feed and train them	2573.224421151714
3769. the existing	army posts were wholly inadequate	92.87479996435972
3770. in a matter of months the war	department built thirty-two camps each one accommodating fifty thousand	men- sixteen were under canvas in the south and sixteen with frame	structures in the north	5145.73202745445
3771. it was a gargantuan task; a typical	cantonment in the north had twelve hundred buildings an electric-sewer-water	system and twenty-five miles of roads	2332.660157934399
3772. at camp taylor in kentucky	a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had	been standing in mississippi forests one week before	4291.386318250181
3773. the total	operation	was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the panama	canal but in 1917 time was in short supply; in three months	the army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended on the big	ditch in ten years	4381.415312666821
3774. in later years josephus danielswas	to	claim that world war 1 was the first in american history in which	there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers	5144.595000047842
3775. it was the first american war in which the death rate from disease	was lower than that from battle due to the provision of trained	medical personnel compulsory	vaccination rigorous camp sanitation and adequate hospital	facilities	3865.086711882837
3776. to the middle of september 1918 there had been fewer than	10000 deaths from disease in the new army	2595.0159257331597
3777. this enviable record	would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which	struck	the world with murderous stealth	2047.4084851887953
3778. it was the influenza pandemic	of 1918-19	140.3151744589346
3779. the malady was popularly known as the spanish flu	from the alleged locale of its origin	1269.2675114342658
3780. the world-wide total of deaths	from spanish flu was around twenty million; in the united	states 300000 succumbed to it	2815.4547225229517
3781. in mid-september 1918 the influenza-pneumonia	pandemic swept through every american military camp; during	the eight-week blitz attack 25000 soldiers died from the disease	and the death rate increased almost	fifty times to 4 per week per 1000 men	4042.664595416808
3782. in spite of this catastrophe	the final mortality figure from disease in the american army	during world war 1 was 15 per 1000 per year contrasted with	110 per 1000 per year in the mexican war and 65 in the american civil	war	6699.466138780527
3783. both secretary of war baker and secretary of navy	daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing	reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of	men who had been removed from their home environment	4225.970764690066
3784. their policy	ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a	libertine and that in sex affairs god-given passion was a proof	of manliness	4451.303265131169
3785. baker moved first; six days after war was declared	he appointed raymond fosdick chairman of the commission on training	camp activities	2023.11482006144
3786. fosdick a brother of minister	harry emerson fosdick was a graduate of princeton and a member of	phi beta kappa and the american philosophical association	3898.6197084402106
3787. his	assignment was not a new one because baker had sent him to the mexican	border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack	of discipline drunkenness and venereal disease in american military	camps	3758.212479714345
3788. fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of	saloons and houses of prostitution with filles de joie from all	over the country flocking to san antonio laredo and el paso to	woman the cribs	5776.05183109122
3789. he also ascertained that many officers were	indifferent to the problem including commanding general frederick	funston who gave fosdick the nickname of reverend	2311.4329980473617
3790. on the basis	of the long chronicle of military history funston and his brethren	assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a	mission like fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder	5783.645335459743
3791. during the brief mexican venture fosdick's report to the	secretary recommended a definite stand by the war department against	the saloon and the excesses of prostitution	2737.3765452425237
3792. the problem involved military	necessity as much as morality for in pre-penicillin days venereal	disease was a crippling disability	2600.177620037472
3793. fosdick insisted that a strong	word was needed from washington and it was immediately forthcoming	1100.0447715650266
3794. baker put the cribs and the saloons out of bounds ordered the	co-operation of military officers with local law authorities and told	communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions	were restored	5469.655755333215
3795. both baker and fosdick knew that a substitute was	necessary that a verboten approach was not the real answer	1718.221120080223
3796. they	were aware that soldiers went to town in more ways than one because	of the monotony of camp life to find the only release available in	the absence of movies reading rooms and playing fields with adequate	athletic equipment	6305.25557316001
3797. both knew that when trains stopped at texan crossroads	bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if	they had any reading material to spare even a newspaper	3106.308100196865
3798. there was	no time in the short mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the	area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future	4286.90321659441
3799. when the united states entered the first world war baker	made certain that the draft act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor	to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps	in which prostitution was outlawed	4382.846360957898
3800. even so fosdick as the new	chairman of the commission on training camp activities encountered	strong and vociferous opposition	2589.8720176931893
3801. new orleans had a notorious red-light	district extending over twenty-eight city blocks and the business-minded	mayor of the city journeyed to washington to present the	case for the god-given right of men to be men	3741.656592185797
3802. in europe premier	clemenceau showing his animal proclivities as the tiger of	france asked pershing by letter for the creation of special houses	where the sexual desires of american men could be satisfied	5317.214727068077
3803. when	fosdick showed the letter to baker his negative response was: for	god's sake raymond don't show this to the president or	he'll stop the war	2732.1606088906906
3804. ultimately fosdick's fit to fight	slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district	in the united states was closed a hundred and ten of them	4272.563284556456
3805. the	result was that the rate of venereal disease in the american army	was the lowest in our military history	1874.0520006009788
3806. this was the negative	side of the situation	249.73686889918622
3807. affirmatively baker worked on the premise that	young men spontaneously prefer to be decent and that opportunities	for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities	in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations	3953.4316464348485
3808. the wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including	the ymca the knights of columbus the jewish welfare	board the american library association and the playground and	recreation association- private societies which voluntarily performed	the job that was taken over almost entirely by the special services	division of the army itself in world war 2	8032.931454888322
3809. over these	voluntary agencies in 1917-18 the ctca served as a co-ordinating	body in carrying out what survey called the most stupendous	piece of social work in modern times	3102.4770092215867
3810. under fosdick the first	executive officer of the ctca was richard byrd whose name in	later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes	4288.2923059247
3811. from the point of view of popularity the best-known member of	the commission was walter camp the yale athlete whose sobriquet	was the father of american football	2846.614194412846
3812. he was placed in charge of	athletics and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics known	as the daily dozen	3056.5796507900136
3813. the ctca program of activities was profuse:	william farnum and mary pickford on the screen elsie janis	and harry lauder on the stage books provided by the american	library association full equipment for games and sports- except that	no bones were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played	on any floor and known as african golf	5319.886560811623
3814. the ctca distributed	a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited	renditions of the selections found therein plus a number of others	whose lyrics were more earthy- from johnny get your gun to	keep the home fires burning to mademoiselle from armentieres	6681.030188737711
3815. in the imagination of the nineteenth century the greek tragedians and	shakespeare stand side by side their affinity transcending all the	immense contrarieties of historical circumstance religious belief and	poetic form	3339.3885607276875
3816. we no longer use the particular terms of lessing	and victor hugo	962.5936179002914
3817. but we abide by their insight	43.7819357563648
3818. the word tragedy	encloses for us in a single span both the greek and the elizabethan	example	2125.219658273244
3819. the sense of relationship overreaches the historical	truth that shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual	works of aeschylus sophocles and euripides	2590.5164037796903
3820. it transcends the	glaring fact that the elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas	the greeks kept the two modes severely distinct	3055.685381387844
3821. it overcomes our emphatic	awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the	two languages and styles of dramatic presentation	2332.2438163196944
3822. the intimations of	a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any	sense of disparity	2348.1321566595534
3823. comparable visions of life are at work in antigone	and romeo and juliet	792.0305191596079
3824. we see at once what victor hugo	means when he calls macbeth a northern scion of the house of atreus	2810.06379426274
3825. elsinore seems to lie in a range of mycenae and the fate of orestes	resounds in that of hamlet	1717.7138641048691
3826. the hounds of hell search out their	quarry in apollo's sanctuary as they do in the tent of richard 3	2827.3541534095275
3827. oedipus and lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness	497.98731024087044
3828. it it not between euripides and shakespeare that the western	mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life	2837.4716119362038
3829. it is after	the late seventeenth century	94.55183093481442
3830. i say the late seventeenth century because	racine stands on the far side	of the chasm	1885.1402762737678
3831. the image of man which enters into force with aeschylus	is still vital in phedre and athalie	1409.0151184937438
3832. it is the	triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point	of no return	1867.1442837788406
3833. shakespeare is closer to sophocles than he is to pope	and voltaire	641.6819967712905
3834. to say this is to set aside the realness of time	751.999196071148
3835. but	it is true nevertheless	14.733315420543907
3836. the modes of the imagination implicit in	athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age	of descartes and newton	3700.137703043353
3837. it is only then that the ancient habits	of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience	were abandoned	2027.8456282933998
3838. with the discours de la methode and the	principia the things undreamt of in horatio's philosophy seem	to pass from the world	3273.9859953416862
3839. in greek tragedy as in shakespeare	mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man	1095.6374482386298
3840. the reality	of orestes entails that of the furies; the weird sisters wait	for the soul of macbeth	2356.0156859385575
3841. we cannot conceive of oedipus without a	sphinx nor of hamlet without a ghost	943.1805856461373
3842. the shadows cast by the personages	of greek and shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness	1887.8976486316794
3843. and the entirety of the natural world is party to the action	643.878282956006
3844. the thunderclaps over the sacred wood at colonus and the storms in	king lear are caused by more than weather	2822.241692058425
3845. in tragedy lightning	is a messenger	44.015177981294265
3846. but it can no longer be so once benjamin franklin	has flown a kite to it	1881.8919763758265
3847. the	tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and	hell	646.6489501624098
3848. those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace	or damnation	1628.5366383996254
3849. oedipus and lear instruct us how little of	the world belongs to man	786.5211087191911
3850. mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous	watch and to all sentinels whether at elsinore or on the battlements	at mycenae the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle	5174.263402764564
3851. it	banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose	261.28000051759466
3852. but at the touch of	hume and voltaire the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted	the mind since agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance disappeared	altogether or took tawdry refuge among the gaslights of melodrama	5809.260616632651
3853. modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to	purgatory	787.3206364987757
3854. in athens in shakespeare's england and at	versailles the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest	2110.37876916245
3855. the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre	642.8401837981238
3856. from it spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the	common man	1874.9403893486317
3857. tragedy presumes such a configuration	14.856230148909296
3858. its sphere is that	of royal courts dynastic quarrels and vaulting ambitions	962.6786994297415
3859. the same	metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to oedipus	and macbeth because they applied also to alcibiades and essex	2178.61885148573
3860. and	the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public	1182.7864931692689
3861. agamemnon	creon and medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes	of the polis	944.3201691772853
3862. similarly the sufferings of hamlet othello	or phedre engage the fortunes of the state	1414.0910560547316
3863. they are enacted at the	heart of the body politic	373.0911122525286
3864. hence the natural setting of tragedy is the	palace gate the public square or the court chamber	2139.7345183228854
3865. greek and elizabethan	life and to a certain extent the life of versailles shared	this character of intense publicity	1732.9889152481767
3866. princes and factions clashed	in the open street and died on the open scaffold	1422.7901760701884
3867. with the	rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs	shifted from the public to the private	2322.519916829705
3868. the art of defoe and richardson	is founded on an awareness of this great change	1644.3497064689625
3869. heretofore	an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high	personages and if it occurred in the public view	2343.9874646501366
3870. behind the tragic	hero stands the chorus the crowd or the observant courtier	1190.696158198692
3871. in the	eighteenth century there emerges for the first time the notion of a	private tragedy	number of elizabethan domestic tragedies such as the famous arden		1915.9382568888868
3872. in la nouvelle-heloi^se and werther	tragedy is made intimate	394.4668409455732
3873. and private tragedy became the chosen ground	not of drama but of the new unfolding art of the novel	1717.6382857266992
3874. the novel was not only the presenter of the new secular rationalistic	private world of the middle class	2358.8309265615635
3875. it served also as a literary form	exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture	1423.5616327171751
3876. i have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements	with regard to the character of the greek and elizabethan public	3681.459260081397
3877. but one major fact seems undeniable	43.29586671867686
3878. until the advent of rational	empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic	and allegoric	2111.8061197804045
3879. available evidence regarding the natural world the	course of history and the varieties of human action were translated	into imaginative designs or mythologies	2330.6900419431595
3880. classic mythology and christianity	are such architectures of the imagination	555.6776434642078
3881. they order the manifold	levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which	extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars	2475.5207591456265
3882. there had not yet	supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of	mathematics and scientific formulas	2111.669935733734
3883. the poet was by definition a realist	his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality	1256.2950375107455
3884. and in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant	part radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole	toward which all perspectives converge	4674.240027496256
3885. i mean such concepts as the presence	of the supernatural in human affairs the sacraments of grace	and divine retribution the idea of preordainment	the prophecy of the witches to macbeth or god's covenant with		2853.5201412321253
3886. i refer to the notion that the structure	of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history	conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality	play set in motion by the gods for our instruction	6661.682222746356
3887. these	conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or	engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time	of aeschylus to that of shakespeare	3323.030451191992
3888. and although they were as i	have indicated under increasing strain at the time of racine they	are still alive in his theatre	3467.0203155806084
3889. they are the essential force behind	the conventions of tragedy	373.0839124822127
3890. they are as decisively present in the oresteia	and oedipus as in macbeth king lear and phedre	2130.630598254274
3891. after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to	be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits	of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar	3118.156318556341
3892. concepts	such as grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of	being which are everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy	lose their vitality	3697.1160073553824
3893. they become philosophic abstractions of	a private and problematic relevance or mere catchwords in religious customs	which had in them a diminishing part of active belief	2740.300726072363
3894. after shakespeare	the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer	the blind seers the poets or orpheus performing his art in the face	of hell	4112.855791027504
3895. they are descartes newton and voltaire	43.57345177218864
3896. and their chroniclers	are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists	969.2719633839472
3897. the	romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change	371.8893892216418
3898. they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable	558.8126976428176
3899. rousseau's	primitivism the anti-newtonian mythology of blake coleridge's	organic metaphysics victor hugo's image of the poets as the magi	and shelley's unacknowledged legislators are related elements	in the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against the new	scientific rationalism	4154.4294214434485
3900. from this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting	greek and shakespearean drama into a new total form capable	of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses	4681.911561642059
3901. the dream	of achieving a synthesis between the sophoclean and the shakespearean	genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time	of shelley and victor hugo to that of bayreuth	3457.9110435960697
3902. it could not really	be fulfilled	65.13031029595571
3903. the conventions into which the romantics tried to breath	life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling	1880.2209277158072
3904. but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works and	these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age	of ibsen and chekhov	4502.215607627573
3905. the wedding of the hellenic to the northern	genius was one of the dominant motifs in goethe's thought	1570.1479367620684
3906. his	italian journey was a poet's version of those perennial thrusts	across the alps of the german emperors of the middle ages	3261.6388500971784
3907. the dream	of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew german ambitions	toward rome and sicily	1742.1927707133596
3908. goethe asks in wilhelm meister	whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower and the light	of the mediterranean glows through torquato tasso and the roman	elegies	4680.907065891691
3909. goethe believed that the germanic spirit with its	grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance should	be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the hellenic	3232.882789096691
3910. on the narrower ground of poetic form he felt that in the drama	of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to	the shakespearean vision of tragic will	5152.677191146646
3911. the wager between god and	satan brings on the destiny of faust but faust assumes his role	voluntarily	1573.110650734269
3912. the third act of faust 2 is a formal celebration	of the union between the germanic and the classic between	the spirit of euripides and that of romantic drama	4668.305539924915
3913. the motif of faust's	love for helen of troy goes back to the sources of the faustian	legend	1579.1190271861765
3914. it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest	wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty	2595.7897408453273
3915. there can be no greater	magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all in whom	beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible	3092.991572202903
3916. it is	thus that the brightness of helen passes through marlowe's faustus	957.6165749602609
3917. goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends	167.00644916030816
3918. faust rescuing	helen from menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance europe	restoring to life the classic tradition	2362.388218372413
3919. the necromantic change from	the palace at sparta to faust's gothic castle directs us to the	aesthetic meaning of the myth- the translation of antique drama into	shakespearean and romantic guise	3335.302963797464

3944. sturley thought that this matter might be the rest	of the tithes and the college houses and landes in our towne	3052.6440629535173
3945. he	suggested offering half to sir edward fearing lest he shall thinke	it to good for us and procure it for himselfe as he served us the	last time	3099.089783785764
3946. this refers to what had happened after the earl of warwick	died in 1590 when the town petitioned burghley for the right to	name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but greville bought	the lordship for himself	6069.159407793228

3967. the queen agreed on december 17 a warrant was signed	on january 27 and the exchequer paid quiney his expenses on february	27 15989	2466.490185672811
3968. he listed what he had spent for my own diet in	london eighteen weeks in which i was sick a month; my mare at coming	up 14 days; another i bought there to bring me home 7 weeks;	and i was six days going thither and coming homewards; all which	cost me at the least 20	7918.595600187424
3969. he was allowed forty-four pounds in all	including fees to the masters of requests mr fanshawe of the	exchequer the solicitor general and other officials and their clerks	2992.453670950121
3970. if he borrowed money from shakespeare or with his help he would	now have been able to repay the loan	2838.6440410775017
3971. since more is known about	quiney than about any other acquaintance of shakespeare in stratford	his career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602	2710.1607608934783
3972. during 1598	and 1599 he made manye guiftes of myne owne provision bestowed uppon	cowrtiers + others for the better effectinge of our suites in hande	2708.1378159500737

3975. he also sued them for taking toll	of grain at their market	640.2835839700107
3976. accompanied by master greene our solicitor		quiney tried to consult sir edward coke attorney general	and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper that we might have	access to their master for his counsel h butt colde nott have him	att leasure by the reason of thees trobles		5998.678113709555
3977. he set down that i gave f greene a pynte of muskadell	and a roll of bread that last morning i went to have his company	to master attorney	3095.0683828929677
3978. after returning to stratford he drew up a	defense	of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it	and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and shakespeare's	father	5473.836630215783
3979. no one he wrote took any corn of greville's for	his bailiff of husbandry swore a greate oathe thatt who soe came	to put hys hande into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande	be hynde hym	4131.456786153611
3980. quiney was in london again in june 1601 and in	november when he rode up as shakespeare must often have done by way	of oxford high wycombe and uxbridge and home through aylesbury	and banbury	5623.670848919116
3981. after quiney was elected bailiff in september	1601 without greville's approval greene wrote him that coke	had promised to be of counsel for stratford and had advised that	the office of bayly may be exercised as it is taken upon you		3382.4064485611184
3982. asked	by	the townsmen to cease his suit greville had answered that hytt	shulde coste hym f first + sayed it must be tried ether before my lorde	anderson in the countrey or his uncle ffortescue in the exchequer	with whom he colde more prevaile then we	5674.644298467456
3983. the corporation proposed	chief justice anderson for an arbiter sending him a gift of sack	and claret	1412.7479566450343
3984. lady greville daughter of the late lord chancellor	bromley and niece of sir john fortescue was offered twenty pounds	by the townsmen to make peace; she labored + thought she shuld	effecte it but her husband said that we shuld wynne it by the sworde	5421.102776774236
3985. his servant robin whitney threatened quiney who had whitney	bound to the good abaringe to keep the peace	1570.8533909847445
3986. a report of	f edw: grevyles minaces to the baileefe aldermen + burgesses	of stratforde tells how quiney was injured by greville's men:	in the tyme f ryc' quyney was bayleefe ther came some of	them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher	thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the	baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order + comminge by	in	f hurley burley	0.30166232349522504

3988. the fall of rome the discovery of precious metals and the protestant	reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood	by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed	5321.38012187493
3989. often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct	by those individuals or nations which he is studying	1881.4829534450353
3990. unconsciously	governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking	without fully realizing why they are doing so	2577.724961274213
3991. they react in obedience	to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural	law	1418.0973319145808
3992. a court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling	that the law is inimical to the numerical majority	3494.5278883870974
3993. a nation may	go to war on some trifling pretext when in reality it may have been	guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake	3095.3762051657786
3994. when	the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible	cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious	instinct as possible guides	4662.754702188174
3995. adams firmly contended	that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical	environment on history	1408.8010940003508
3996. here was another indispensable tool	22.319371301022432
3997. indeed	he concluded that geographical conditions have exercised a great	possibly a preponderating influence over man's destiny	1419.950842889103
3998. the failure	of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens	had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical	conformation	3677.1322794631633
3999. all areas of history were either favorably or adversely	affected by the geographical environment and no respectable historian	could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of	geography	3222.352864109244
4000. brooks adams was consistent in his admonishments	to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess	2596.058889699007
4001. however as a practicing historian he himself has left few clues	to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing	history	2308.0007339801728
4002. in fact if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness	of his historicism they must be based on scanty evidence	3017.531310529285
4003. what evidence	is available would seem to indicate that brooks unlike his older	brother henry had most of the methodological vices usually found	in the amateur	2729.8648329261136
4004. a credulousness a distaste for documentation an uncritical	reliance on contemporary accounts and a proneness to assume	a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences	of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate	the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public	7632.677354106568
4005. this	is not to assume that his work was without merit but the validity	of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be	considered against this background of an unprofessional approach	3537.2606012838683
4006. his credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the	emancipation of massachusetts which purports to examine the	trials of moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the israelite	exodus from egypt and the leadership of the puritan clergy in	colonial new england	7139.742584042966
4007. much criticism has been leveled at this rather	forced analogy but what is equally significant is adams' complete	acceptance of the biblical record as good and trustworthy history	2984.0524097339808
4008. in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher	criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming	from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views	4658.773589622897
4009. the desire	to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique	smacks more of	the propagandist than the historian	2032.538817240178
4010. a similar amateurish	characteristic is revealed in adams' failure to check the	accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources	2606.0316296445226
4011. if he found data	that fitted his general plan he used it and counted his sources trustworthy	1417.7479222167067
4012. conversely if statistics were uncovered which contradicted	a cherished theory the sources were denounced as faulty	1887.6472830784382
4013. such manipulations	are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression	of the monasteries during the english reformation	1572.7585279804005
4014. adams depended largely	on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in england	claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because	there were no newspapers	4636.284302000383
4015. this is certainly an irrational dogmatism	in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth	century on twentieth-century terms	2330.766261729362
4016. moreover he rejects the	contemporary accounts of englishmen casually adjudging them to be distorted	by prejudice because the opinions of englishmen are of no	great value	4083.006216342636
4017. what is exposited by this observation is not the inherent	prejudices of englishmen but the anglophobia of brooks adams	1725.7020212104567
4018. in all fairness it must be admitted that adams made no pretense	at being an impartial historian	2119.9252126790284
4019. impartiality to him meant an unwillingness	to generalize and to search for a synthesis	945.5782755880722
4020. he deplored the	impact of german historiography on the writing of history terming	it a dismal monster	2115.3966931714212
4021. ranke and his disciples had reduced history	to a profession of dullness; brooks adams preferred the chronicles	of froissart or the style and theorizing of edward gibbon for	at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote	4300.3641609132155
4022. he wrote	eloquently to william james that impartial history was not only	impossible but undesirable	1645.9787758661055
4023. if the historian was convinced of his own	correctness then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by	disturbing facts	2171.419100867258
4024. it was history that must be in error not the historian	746.982372033663
4025. it was this basic trait that separated adams from the ranks	of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what	was his most serious offense against the historical method- namely	the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting	it to the test of facts	5023.066097337201
4026. all of adams' work reflects this	dogmatic characteristic	250.93916445145433
4027. no page seems to be complete without the statement	of at least one unproved generalization	1098.0509914742966
4028. one example of this	was his assertion that h all servile revolts must be dealt with by	physical force	2583.8601139372236
4029. there is no explanation of terms nor a qualification	that most such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a bald	dogmatism that they must because of some undefined compulsion be	so repelled	3646.9836680223066
4030. on matters of race he was similarly inflexible: most	of the modern latin races seem to have inherited h the rigidity	of the roman mind	3897.703051650219
4031. he cites the french revolution as typifying	this rigidity but makes no mention of the italians who have been able	to	adapt to all types of circumstances	2846.5486632594325
4032. he pontificates that one	of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value	of women in men's eyes	3270.4814798560083
4033. it made no difference that most evidence	points to an opposite conclusion	636.8671617688793
4034. for adams had made up his mind before	all the facts were available	1181.3022012147478
4035. all critics of adams and	his methods have observed this particular deficiency	645.0692240612257
4036. j t shotwell	was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the	fall of the carolingian empire to the woolen trade and he urged adams	to transform his essay into a real history embodying not merely	those facts which fit into his theory but also the modifications	and exceptions	7545.782282341434
4037. a m wergeland called the adams method literally	antihistorical while clive day maintained that the assumptions	were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight	factual evidence	3214.0452857557216
4038. moreover stated day he always omits	facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis	1172.6834714996114
4039. even d a wasson	who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the lifting	of a fog from ancient landscapes was also forced to admit the methodological	deficiencies of the author	3233.6165289817845
4040. in summary brooks adams	felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered	was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature	4831.867701640912
4041. moreover he believed that most professional historians lacked some	of the essential instruments for a proper study of history	1727.999250757568
4042. however	despite the insight of many of his observations his own conclusions	are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the	correct research methods	4648.390375690336
4043. this should not prejudice an evaluation of	his findings but they were not the findings of a completely impartial	investigator	1874.479065453264
4044. what was perhaps more important than his concept of	the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which	shaped the direction of his thought	4269.795017520146
4045. in the final analysis his contribution	to american historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights	into religion economics and darwinism the three factors which	conditioned his search for a law of history	3443.0002813086985
4046. brooks adams considered religion as an extremely significant	manifestation of man's fear of the unknown	1655.402118789627
4047. but it was nothing	more than that	93.71476727900138
4048. religion and the churches were institutions which	had been created by man not god	1402.3171973098842
4049. he did not deny god; he simply	did not believe that a creator intervened or interfered in human	affairs	1721.6360457146852
4050. the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems	suggested by religion	1184.0199048715276
4051. there was no evidence either of a positive	or negative type of the actions of a divine being in this world;	and since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial	activity his research should eliminate the supernatural	4147.44650309929
4052. furthermore	he must regard religion as the expression of human forces	756.6150139378057
4053. certainly he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its	influence on the flow of history but he must not confuse the natural	and the mundane with the divine	3228.0977775352026
4054. adams was not breaking new ground	when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality	a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment	4642.812255990842
4055. students	of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that	there was indeed a direct connection	1416.851907935055
4056. but adams was one of the first	to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor	behind religion	2812.359865615741
4057. it was this fear which explained the development	of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease	the angry deities	2466.05295905588
4058. to keep themselves entrenched in power the	priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle	2352.700897312283
4059. it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business	637.7855081723874
4060. the german barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example:	the germans in the fourth century were a very simple	race who comprehended little of natural laws and who therefore referred	phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention	6306.335583444903
4061. this intervention could only be controlled by priests and thus the	invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class	2330.1315865662245
4062. the	power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the	miracle and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as	did elijah	3719.8668071914676
4063. adams contended that once such a special class	had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain	itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between	god and man	3446.999787385486
4064. thus the church was born and because of its intrinsic	character was soon identified as a conservative institution determined	to resist the forces of change to identify itself with the political	rulers and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses	6694.828942804192
4065. doctrine was not only mysterious; it was also sacred and no	believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined	as we should examine human laws	2993.365303253556
4066. these basic ideas concerning the	nature of religion were adams believed some of the major keys to	the understanding of history and the movement of society	4098.50284345275
4067. the dark views	about the puritans found in the emancipation of massachusetts	were never altered	1102.737928288734
4068. despite their adherence to the status	quo the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments	as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge	3480.888697632642
4069. in the	law of civilization and decay brooks adams traced this evolution	always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more	rational the substance remained unchanged	2986.792843018935
4070. the relic worship and monasticism	of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive	fetish worship and nature myths	3025.857153336105
4071. yet the idea imbedded in each	was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that	class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of god	3214.190252812609
4072. to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire	culture of the race was one of imagination and it is largely the	admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar	religiosity- a sentiment he would have probably denied	6920.5342901593995
4073. stephens had written his classic incidents of travel about these	regions a hundred years before and catherwood who had studied piranesi	in london and the great ruins of egypt and greece had drawn	the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text	4231.03332438637
4074. catherwood an	architect in new york had been forgotten like stephens and victor	reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs for a museum a dinosaur	from two or three petrified bones	4870.339977614011
4075. he had unearthed stephens's	letters in a new jersey farmhouse and he discovered stephens's	unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of new york where	the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic	4150.368029474096
4076. victor had been stirred by my account of him in makers and finders	for stephens was one of the lost writers whom melville had seen	in his childhood and whom i was bent on resurrecting	5620.481233304984
4077. victor	had led an adventurous life	43.95016553711995
4078. his metier was the american tropics	and he had lived all over latin america and among the primitive	tribes on the amazon river	3493.8415608818373
4079. well he knew the sleepless nights the howling	sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the	kofanes and huitotoes	2190.6787374507376
4080. he had not yet undertaken the great exploit	of his later years the rediscovery of the ancient inca highway the	route of pizarro in peru but he had climbed to the original el dorado	the andean lake of guatemala and he had scaled the southern sierra	nevada with its tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald	mines of muzo	8208.302572114897
4081. as a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters	of the amazon he had collected specimens for mexican museums	and he had taken to the london zoo a live quetzal the sacred bird of	the old mayans	4059.030759632854
4082. in fact he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in	the forest of ecuador	1639.8351336206338
4083. moreover he had spent six months on the galapagos	islands among the great turtles that captain cook had found	there and now and then he would disappear into some small island of	the west indies	3771.8611731533138
4084. victor's book on john lloyd stephens was largely	written in my study in the house at weston	2122.724682867882
4085. i had had my	name taken out of the telephone book and this was partly because of	a convict who had been discharged from sing sing and who called me night	after night	3555.4873334202725
4086. he said he was a friend of heywood broun who had	run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression	but the generous broun to whom i wrote did not know his name and i	somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling	round the house	7616.7973622029795
4087. but one day came the voice of a man i had known	when he was a boy and i later remembered that this boy thirty years	before had struck me as coming to no good	3768.780950380915
4088. there had been something	sinister about him that warned me against him- i had never felt	that way about any other boy- but when he uttered his name on the	telephone i had forgotten this and i was glad to do what he asked of	me	6995.259363781328
4089. he was a captain he said in the army and on the train to new	york his purse and all his money had been stolen and would i lend	him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the general delivery window	4312.338468740835
4090. never hearing from him again i remembered the little boy of whom	i had had such doubts when he was ten years old	3489.749714581617
4091. we lived for a	while in a movie melodrama with a german cook and her son who turned	out to be nazis	2172.2773206259108
4092. finally we got them out of the house after the boy	had run away four times looking for other nazis threatening to murder	village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next fu^hrer	5629.017658850446
4093. then he began to have epileptic fits	93.856847662172
4094. we found that a charitable	society in new york had a long case-history of the two; and	they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody	else's soup	5343.713924118234
4095. to the weston house came once william allen	neilson the president of smith college who had been one of my old	professors and who still called me boy when i was sixty	3438.723267508443
4096. it	reminded me of my other professor edward kennard rand of whom i	had been so fond when i was at harvard the great mediaevalist and	classical scholar who had asked me to call him ken saying age	counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life sub	specie aeternitatis	7607.245740649831
4097. i had always thought of that lovable man	as many years older than myself although he was perhaps only twenty	years older and he confirmed my feeling along with the feeling of both	my sons that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing	4474.904784322478
4098. i	must have written to say how much i had enjoyed his fine book the	building	of eternal rome and i found he had not regretted giving	me the highest mark in his old course on the later latin poets although	in my final examination i had ignored the questions and filled the	bluebook with a comparison of propertius and coleridge	8344.545640949496
4099. he had written	to me about a dinner he had had with the benedictine monks at st	anselm's priory in washington	2035.0411717372076
4100. there had been reading at table	especially from two books pope gregory the great's account	of st scholastica in his dialogues and my own the world	of washington irving	4672.873933387032
4101. he said some have criticized your book	as	being neither literary criticism nor history	944.1707404035906
4102. of course it was not	meant to be	248.35485518178703
4103. some have felt that washington irving comes out rather	slimly but let them look at the title of the book	1876.1209422549375
4104. he felt as	i felt about this best of all my books that it was really tops	2108.804232601583
4105. two or three times c c burlingham came to lunch with	us in weston that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred	years old and whose birthplace had been my wall street suburb	3846.2471537234646
4106. his	reading ranged from agatha christie to the book of job and he had	an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures while his letters were	full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom	he had been intimately thrown six decades before	6908.150554423363
4107. i could never forget	the gaiety with which when he was both blind and deaf he let me	lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures; and once	when he came to see us in new york he walked away in a rainstorm	unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella although he was at the	time ninety years old	5814.038225956001
4108. there were several men of ninety or more whom	i knew first or last all of whom were still productive and most of	whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex	of their lives	6317.095922099731
4109. i never met john dewey whose style was a sort	of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to mexico with him	when he was investigating the cause of trotsky; but i liked to think	of him at ninety swimming and working at key west long after hemingway	had moved to cuba	5271.519914482355
4110. at lee simonson's house i had dined	with edith hamilton the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar	who had a great popular success with the greek way	4316.059757844063
4111. then	there was mark howe and there was henry dwight sedgwick an accomplished	man of letters who wrote in the spirit of montaigne and produced	in the end a formidable body of work	3538.295822482636
4112. i saw sedgwick often before	his death at ninety-five- he had remarried at the age of ninety-	and he asked me when once i returned from rome if i knew the	cavallinis in the church of st cecilia in trastevere	6316.907415370672
4113. i had to	confess that i had missed these frescoes recently discovered that	he had studied in his eighties	1730.6037255485378
4114. sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy	of epicurus whom with his followers dante put in hell; but	he defended the doctrine in the art of happiness and what indeed	could be said against the epicurean virtues health frugality	privacy culture and friendship	6673.554363172164
4115. of mark antony de wolfe howe	the philosopher whitehead said the earth's first visitors to mars	should be persons likely to make a good impression and when he was	asked whom would you send	3657.0858119664713
4116. he replied my first choice	would be mark howe	391.78683450950047
4117. this friend of many years came once to visit	us in the house at weston	1095.908242328017
4118. then i spoke at the ninetieth birthday	party of w e burghardt du bois who embarked on a fictional	trilogy at eighty-nine and who with the crisis had created a	negro intelligentsia that had never existed in america before him	6334.892987650476
4119. as	their interpreter and guide he had broken with tuskegee and become	a spokesman of the coloured people of the world	2038.3104861793804
4120. mr burlingham-	ccb- wrote to me once about an old friend	of mine s k ratcliffe whom i had first met in london in	1914 and who also came out for a week-end in weston	5616.702633171368
4121. did you ever	know a man with greater zest for information	501.30703876233304
4122. and his memory like	an elephant's stored with precise knowledge of men and things and	happenings	1887.200316203275
4123. his wife katie as gay as a lark and as lively	as a gazelle- she was then seventy-six- had a a sense of humour	that has been denied sk but neither has any aesthetic perceptions	3781.930200623482
4124. people and books are enough for them	139.62182921452472
4125. sk was visiting	ccb and not waiting for breakfast he was off to	the university club where he spent hours writing obituaries of living	americans for the manchester guardian or the glasgow herald	3575.9889642612516
4126. later rising ninety he was beset by publishers for the story	of his life and miracles as he put it but calling himself the needy	knife-grinder he had spent his time writing short articles and long	letters and could not get even a small popular book done	7148.474147883913
4127. then all	but blind he said there was nothing in back to methuselah-	gbs ought to have known that- and i look at my	bookshelves despairingly knowing that i can have nothing more to do	with them	3940.7675335517474
4128. however at eighty-five he had still been busy writing	articles reviewing and speaking and i had never before known an	englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the united	states	5333.318735768107
4129. finally colleges and clubs took the line that speakers	from england were not wanted any longer even speakers like sk	so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the americans	for many years	3667.636436220987
4130. with their facile generalizations about the united	states these mediocrities as they often were had been great successes	2363.259743219958
4131. while sk did not like dylan thomas i liked his poems	very much but i made the mistake of telling dylan thomas so whereupon	he said to me i suppose you think you know all about me	3950.521225179361
4132. i should have replied i probably know something about the best	part of you	1422.3031840210174
4133. but i only thought of that in the middle of the night	639.5869421118928
4134. many years later i went to see sk in england where	he was living at whiteleaf near aylesbury and he showed me beside	his cottage there the remains of the road on which boadicea is supposed	to have travelled	6206.170444366102
4135. he was convinced that george orwell's 1984	was nearly all wrong as it applied to england which was driving	forward into uncharted waters with the danger of a new tyranny	ahead	3325.1673780997626
4136. but however we go whatever our doom it will not take the	orwellian shape	1421.0363611440084
4137. with facts mainly in his mind he was often acute	in the matter of style and he said the young who have as yet	nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines	3846.6181467817196
4138. but put them before a situation which they are forced to depict-	he was speaking of the spanish civil war- and they have no hesitation;	they merely do their best to make it real for others	5758.398304123116
4139. he looked at her as she spoke then got up as she was speaking still	and simply and wordlessly walked out	2027.6765388996469
4140. and that was the end	22.232704074147478
4141. he went to the hotel mayflower and telegraphed mencken	263.49413958611854
4142. would he meet him in baltimore in drawing room a car three	on the train leaving washington at nine o'clock next morning	3263.264215236958
4143. they would go to new york together where parties would be piled on	weariness and on misery	1418.757509710463
4144. both alfred harcourt and	donald brace had written him enthusiastic praise of elmer gantry	and they had ordered 140000 copies- the largest first	printing of any book in history	4647.38994880275
4145. but none of this could soothe the	exacerbated nerves	264.2678780059313
4146. on new year's eve alfred harcourt drove	him up the hudson to bill brown's training camp a well-known establishment	for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who	could no longer help themselves	5366.237483288207
4147. but in departing lewis begged	breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the grosvenor on	his return and he took with him the first thirty galleys of elmer	gantry	3441.4209770437164
4148. on january 4 with the boys back at school and college	mrs lewis wrote harcourt to say that she was thro quite	thro	3492.5737988651135
4149. this whole washington venture was my last gesture	and it has failed	639.0740444412143
4150. physically as well as mentally i have reached the	limit of my endurance	1181.1492394740935
4151. my last gift to him is complete silence until	the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down	1894.921442173839
4152. for him to	divorce god and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity	964.8130382489796
4153. i am	really ill at the present moment and i will go to some sort of a sanitarium	to normalize myself	2042.9178323977321
4154. and she withdrew then to cromwell	hall in cromwell connecticut	561.4404115368225
4155. harcourt replied: i do	really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time	1102.4233908157794
4156. of course	i hope hal can also but those hopes are much more faint	1417.3959346659094
4157. on january 8 1927 he returned to the grosvenor in high	spirits and looking fit	1104.1232093235637
4158. he had been he wrote mencken at once in	the country a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly	changed him	3268.237956699047
4159. charles breasted remembers that before unpacking his bag	he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order and almost at	once the familiar procession of people began milling through our living	room at any hour between two pm and three am	4223.479022777498
4160. they were strays of every kind- university students and journalists	village hangers-on and barflies taxi drivers and editors and unknown	poets as well as friends like elinor wylie and william rose benet	the van dorens and nathan rebecca west and hugh walpole	and osbert sitwell laurence stallings lewis browne william seabrook	arthur hopkins the woodwards	7948.287000930456
4161. when he came home from his	office at the end of the afternoon breasted never knew what gathering	he should expect to find but there almost always was one	3093.097414217212
4162. he did not neglect his wife in cromwell hall but telephoned her and	wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish	to stand behind her in their separation and of his hope that there	would be no bitterness between them	6760.051036686343
4163. she was occupying herself in	an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they	had rented abroad	2025.3566238213189
4164. he was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go	abroad when the gantry galleys were finished	2370.545629361722
4165. for a time urging	breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing	instead he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research	for the labor novel; if breasted agreed they would get a car and tour	the country visiting every kind of industrial center	4968.390066257594
4166. when breasted	insisted that this was impossible for him lewis decided to go abroad	1406.47859333906
4167. he telephoned l m birkhead and asked him and his	wife to come to europe as his guests but birkhead declined on the	grounds that one of them must be in the united states when elmer	gantry was published	4128.5181747187025
4168. lewis was spending his mornings with the	help of two secretaries on the galleys of that long novel making considerable	revisions and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity	exhausted him once more so that he was compelled to spend three days	in the harbor sanatorium in the last week of january	7686.57954297908
4169. before he	made that retreat he telephoned earl blackman in kansas city and	asked him to come to europe with him	2020.5582868345089
4170. blackman was to be in new york	by february 2 because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning	2338.245239027048
4171. lewis told him what clothes he should bring along and enjoined him	not to buy anything that he did not already own they would do that	in new york	3104.140639123388
4172. blackman arrived a day or two early and lewis took him	to a department store immediately and outfitted him luggage and all	and then he took him to a party at the woodwards that went on until	four in the morning	6446.909587153846
4173. on the evening that they were to sail	lewis himself gave a party but he was too indisposed to appear at it	2155.7983552676096
4174. woodward took occasion to warn blackman about lewis's drinking	and urged him to try to keep him sober	2363.782771265899
4175. after a dinner party for	which she had come down to new york mrs lewis and casanova	arrived to see them off and elinor wylie made tart observations that	indicated that lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to	be about the real nature of their separation	4882.403421103373
4176. nevertheless mrs	lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished	let him sleep with chambermaids if he must but she begged blackman	try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in	good health	6711.816986420441
4177. as they stood at the first-class rail waving down to his	wife and casanova below lewis said earl there is gracie's	future husband	2313.894167335518
4178. and when questioned by ship's reporters about	the separation she said i adore him and he adores me	2358.33194042621
4179. blackman had brought news from kansas city	94.08602689028694
4180. before his departure	a group of his friends the reverend stidger among them had given	him a luncheon and stidger had seen advance sheets of elmer gantry	4316.441526509605
4181. he was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered	fifty technical errors in its account of church practices	2028.246917038246
4182. l m	birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent	968.6098814437606
4183. but his rancor	did not cease and presently on march 13 when he preached a sermon	on the text and ben-hadad was drunk he told his congregation	how disappointed he was in mr lewis how he regretted having	had him in his house and how he should have been warned by the fact	that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the	book	5893.546127100024
4184. but that sermon like those of hundreds of other ministers was	yet to be delivered	1626.2249188064784
4185. in london lewis took the usual suite	in bury street	374.09062605145795
4186. to the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life	about his wish to be a newspaperman once more about the prevalence of	american slang in british speech about the loquacity of the english	and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage about	his plans to wander for two years unless stopped and made to write	another book	8208.5621141435
4187. the manchester guardian wondered how anyone	in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to mr lewis	since it was well known that mr lewis always did all of the talking	3525.6840140132967
4188. his english friends it said had gone into training to keep	up with him vocally and with his allegro movements around the luncheon	table	3684.7559802968194
4189. the new york times editorialist wondered just who	would stop mr lewis and make him write a book	1574.2223176623133
4190. lewis's	remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce american	reporters to invade the offices of harcourt brace + company for	information to pursue mrs lewis to cromwell hall and after	she had returned to new york to ferret her out at the stanhope on	upper fifth avenue where she had taken an apartment	6455.299519282293
4191. there to the	evening post she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained	that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son	which henceforth would be strictly american	3342.5896973969275
4192. these rumors of permanent	separation started up a whole crop of stories about her	1409.3318801644814
4193. one had	it that a friend protesting her snobbery said but gracie	you are an american aren't you	1575.3775639806831
4194. and she replied i was born	in america but i was conceived in vienna	1407.3156789419545
4195. lewis	himself furthered these tales	15.027155988805088
4196. he is said to have reported that once	when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation	and the friend protested that it had been nothing she replied	well it was your healthy american peasant blood that pulled	you through	7000.8844911802635
4197. with these and similar tales he was entertaining his	english friends all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing	blackman the sights of london and its environs	3205.7889950237395
4198. at once upon	his arrival he telephoned lady sybil colefax who invited them to	tea and then lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding	up his friends	5155.185328046264
4199. he invited lady sybil lord thomson bechhofer	roberts and a half dozen others	792.3580097342603
4200. it was a dinner party lewis had	been drinking during the afternoon and long before the party really	got under way he was quite drunk with the result that the party broke	up even before dinner was over	6035.557977312513
4201. lewis at the head of the table would	leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks	that when not highly offensive were at least highly inappropriate	and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed	4306.106830673139
4202. when	blackman emerged from the bedroom everyone was gone except the tolerant	lord thomson who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour	and then blackman lay awake most of that night despairing of what he	must expect on the continent	6543.772706442887
4203. finally at dawn he fell asleep and	when he awoke and came into the living room he found lewis in his pajamas	before the fire smoking a cigarette	2995.2970468366493
4204. blackman said that he wanted	to apologize for not having prevented lewis from making that horrible	spectacle of himself that he should have seized him by the neck	at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom	5906.836417404396
4205. lewis warned him never	to lay a hand on him and then blackman asked for his fare back	to the united states	2181.087651013041
4206. lewis looked at him and began to cry and then	saying that he was going to make a promise he asked blackman to call	the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did	not want	6402.719688484122
4207. and from now on for the rest of this trip i will only	drink what you agree that i should drink	2037.5678038616206
4208. blackman called the porter	and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy and after	that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner or on one of their	walking trips beer or in france and italy wine in moderation	6587.089330391806
4209. lewis gave him a guidebook tour of london and motoring and	walking took him to stratford but the london stay was for only ten	days and on the twentieth they took the train for southampton where	they spent the night for an early morning channel crossing	4695.883107790671
4210. near	southampton in a considerable establishment lived homer vachell	a well-known pulp writer and his brother horace- both friends of	lewis's	3060.1375671926853
4211. he suggested that they call on these brothers who received	them pleasantly	637.2393460951139
4212. then they returned to their hotel and got ready	for bed	753.256330619439
4213. it was late and blackman was ready to go to sleep but lewis	was not	1098.0505834788537
4214. he said we had a good time tonight didn't we earl	755.1662336569418
4215. earl agreed and lewis said that it would have been very different	if his wife had been with him	1727.8969071568747
4216. then he kept blackman awake	for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife	and himself in which discussing the evening he was continually berated	4830.77674341083
4217. he began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does	not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming	and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries	3850.5719808258277
4218. from 1613 on if the lists exist they contain between twenty to thirty	names	1410.6413831190946
4219. as the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was according	to masson two hundred fifty-nine	the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that	year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors	who then incepted	4370.020065841803
4220. there were four from st john's and	four from christ's three from pembroke and two from each of the	colleges jesus peterhouse queens' and trinity with caius	clare king's magdalene and sidney supplying one each in the ordo	senioritatis	6231.220185547672
4221. the list was headed by henry hutton of st	john's who was matriculated from st john's at easter	1625	1714.0410786500263
4222. he became a fellow of jesus in 1629 proceeded ma from	jesus in 1632 and was proctor in 1639-40	2568.8712607861335
4223. the second name was edward	kempe matriculated from queens' college at easter 1625	786.9847167078703
4224. he proceeded ma in 1632 and bd in 1639 being made	fellow in 1632	1410.509909267077
4225. he was ordained deacon 16 june and priest 22 december	1633	501.3446852143996
4226. the third name was john ravencroft who was admitted	to the inner temple in november 1631	1870.1861345414122
4227. the fourth name was john	milton of christ's college followed by richard manningham	of peterhouse who matriculated 16 october 1624	1869.8971429940987
4228. venn gave his ba	as 1624 a mistake for 1629	560.0525975660813
4229. manningham also proceeded ma	in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year	1254.0027683035619
4230. john	boutflower of christ's was twelfth in the list coming from perse	school under mr lovering as pensioner 20 april 1625 under mr	alsop	3702.866604061961
4231. the fourteenth name was richard buckenham written	buckman admitted to christ's college under scott 2 july 1625	1415.831641657504
4232. the fifteenth name was thomas baldwin admitted to christ's	4 march 1625 under alsop	1411.3813686767037
4233. christ's college was well represented	that year in the ordo and the name highest on the list from that	college was milton's fourth in the entire university	2876.4681027916026
4234. small wonder	that milton later boasted of how well his work had been received	there since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher	than that of any other inceptor from christ's of that year	6027.314710614145
4235. it is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby	these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they	contained assumed the order in which we find them	3549.2790004421304
4236. the process usually	began with a tutor boasting about a boy as chappell had boasted about	lightfoot to the higher officers of the college and university	4135.972963255639
4237. then the various officers of the college might take up the case	640.8927259821932
4238. it	would however reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the	public-school performances of the incepting bachelors and the place	that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported	himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was	incepting	7269.127110549911
4239. of course the higher officials could add or place a name	on the list wherever they wished	1431.6617398619542
4240. milton's name being fourth is neither	too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of	vice-chancellor proctor master or other mighty hand	4101.737857224895
4241. he evidently	earned the place assigned him	95.0221622245767
4242. career	looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years	of milton's undergraduate days certain phases of his college	career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us	5496.5969212652635
4243. of	course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of	education he received	1254.4970186726391
4244. it differed from what an undergraduate receives	today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty	of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely	scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates	6331.838549671915
4245. milton	was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge	of latin grammar logic-rhetoric ethics physics or natural philosophy	metaphysics and latin greek and hebrew	2860.059343088621
4246. he had also	sampled various special fields of learning being unable to miss some	study of divinity justinian	2353.0378264442625
4247. above all	he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable	degree of artistry	1578.9560215146225
4248. he had learned to dispute devastatingly both formally	and informally in latin and according to the rules on any topic	pro or con drawn from almost any subject more especially from aristotle's	works	5334.5550471548495
4249. he could produce carefully constructed orations	set and formal speeches artfully and prayerfully made by writing and	rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide and then	delivered verbatim from memory	3673.0467150262075
4250. he had also learned to dispute extempore	remarkably well the main evidence for which of course is the presence	of his name in the honors list of 162829	4480.79432009694
4251. he also displayed	the ability to write latin verse on almost any topic of dispute the	verses of course to be delivered from memory	2452.1465861667143
4252. then we have surviving	at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in naturam non	pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica	4086.861362071881
4253. but	his greatest achievement in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues	and teachers was his amazing ability to produce literary latin	pieces and he was often called on to do so	3762.4670652107075
4254. these were his public	academic activities domi forisque in the college and in the university	1657.4252823557358
4255. and his performances attracted much attention as the frequency	of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his	undergraduate activities testifies	2706.244476643572
4256. his other activities are	not so easily recovered	249.99051383166292
4257. his statements about sports and exercises of	a physical nature are suggestive but inconclusive	943.5335660170425
4258. his later boastings	of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and	practice devoted to the use of that weapon	3681.5867854337775
4259. venn and others have dealt	with sports and pastimes at cambridge in milton's day with not very	specific results	1731.08502492639
4260. milton himself uncommunicative as he is about	his lesser and nonliterary activities at least gives us some evidence	that he was a great walker under any and all conditions	4644.020635654799
4261. his early	poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city	and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its	surrounding countryside	3090.6402968429056
4262. the town itself and the reedy cam he	often visited as did all in the university	1886.6497874699185
4263. the churches the taverns	and the various other places of the town must have known his figure	well as he roved to and about them	2597.3464742351034
4264. the tiny hamlet of chesterton	to the north with the fens and marshes lying on down the ouse river	may have attracted him often as it did many other youths of the time	5327.80457324378
4265. the gog magog hills to the southeast afforded him and all other	students a vantage point from which to view the town and university	of their dwelling	2868.6168629052663
4266. the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly	spectacular in its scenery though it offers easy going to the	foot traveler	3262.6818169671305
4267. ball games especially football required some attention	and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant	or spectator	1724.1792644523216
4268. he smoked as did everybody and imbibed the various alcoholic	beverages of that day although his protestations while at cambridge	and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence	from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and we	must add of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers	8023.1063062630465
4269. what manner of person does milton appear to have been	when as an undergraduate he resided at christ's college	1726.821586161955
4270. he was	then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance medium stature	and handsome face	1892.954165270396
4271. graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had	taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight wiry	frame he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college	to which he himself referred in prolusion 6: a quibusdam	audivi nuper domina	4948.209739672609
4272. that is if we can trust that most specious	of prolusions packed as it is with wit and persiflage	2581.577357770012
4273. the domina	sounds real enough if we could only trust the conditions under	which we learn of its use; but anyone who would put much trust in any	phase of prolusion 6 except its illusive allusiveness deserves	whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously	stilted banter	5071.834260577143
4274. in short the traditional epithet for milton of 'lady	of christ's' while eminently fitting rests only on this	baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing	milton left us	5314.597377671054
4275. aubrey's mention of it	comes from this prolusion through christopher	milton or edward phillips	943.1042773474776
4276. it is not a question of truth or falsity;	the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the	epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that	almost nothing in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false	6571.970242150788
4277. the entire exercise latin and english is most suggestive of the	kind of person milton had become at christ's during his undergraduate	career; the mere fact that he was selected though as a substitute	to act as interlocutor or moderator for it or perhaps we should say	with buck as 'father of the act' is in itself a difficult phase	of his development to grasp	5747.630378287727
4278. milton was to act as the archfool the	supreme wit the lightly bantering pater pater liber who could	at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could	at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering and	with words alone	6822.334570473375
4279. from an exercise involving merely raucous rough-and-tumble	comedy in his hands the performance turned into a revel of	wit and word play indecent at times but always learned pointed and	carefully aimed at some individuals present and at the whole assembly	4312.402426473325
4280. to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent	for both solemn and ribald raillery a talent not bestowed on many persons	but one with which milton was marked as being endowed and in which	at least in this performance he obviously reveled	6931.526529521642
4281. it may be thought	unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform	if again we may trust the opening of the oratio for it marks	the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play	that even in this latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of	viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an	adversary	5809.291379402977
4282. but the real beginnings of this development in him go back	to the opposing of grammar school and probably if it had not been this	occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others such	as the first prolusion that set off this streak in him of unbridled	and scathing verbal attack on an enemy	8050.336712599887
4283. all western europe would hear	and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century	1734.1591003869773
4284. but these prolusions that we have surviving from the christ's	college days are only one phase of his existence then	2812.865555000808
4285. perhaps	his most important private activity was the combination of reading	discussion with a few- if we can trust his writings to diodati and	the younger gill very few- congenial companions	3336.7199525404167
4286. lines 23-36 of lycidas	later point to a friendship with edward king who entered	christ's college 9 june 1626	2572.8446294557043
4287. no other names among the young men	in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton	as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted	3321.4769776969215
4288. but that scarcely	means that he was the aloof forbidding type of student who shared	few if any activities with his fellows the banter of the surviving	prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this	5443.9034553673555
4289. apparently he was	not a participant in the college or university theatricals which he	once attacked as utterly unworthy performances;	but even in that famous passage milton was aiming not at the	theatricals as such but at their performance by 'persons either enter'd	or presently to enter into the ministry'	4960.955975760862
4290. the fact that he	nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of	the boys later in his hypothetical academy should not be taken	too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances	5891.349880018592
4291. perhaps in that short piece or letter written to hartlib in	which he sketched his scheme for educating young men he merely overlooked	that phase of their exercises	2975.3024937023974
4292. writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions	that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe	and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot	5311.942183166955
4293. on	the other hand the bright vision of the future has been directly stated	in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies- science	fiction of course is related if sometimes distantly to that	utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period	of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries	produced edward bellamy's looking backward and h g	wells's a modern utopia	5712.7788096797085
4294. in arthur clarke's childhood's	end though written after the present flood of dystopias	began we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly	defined	3903.071030095046
4295. childhood's end- apparently indebted to kurd	lasswitz's utopian romance auf zwei planeten and	also to wells's histories of the future especially the world set	free-	describes	the bloodless conquest of earth by the overlords vastly superior	creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for	its next stage of development an eventual merging with the composite	mind of the universe	5738.0770937207535
4296. arriving just in time to stop men from turning	their planet into a radioactive wasteland the overlords unite earth	into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and	ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist	6089.575054979604
4297. under their rule	earth becomes a technological utopia	168.2116195531729
4298. both abolition of war and new	techniques of production particularly robot factories greatly increase	the world's wealth a situation described in the following passage	which has the true utopian ring: everything was so cheap that	the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by	the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once	been	8223.437765829049
4299. a man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever he fancied-	without handing over any money	1253.2346686204498
4300. with destructive tensions and	pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human	life- rebuilding entire cities expanding facilities for entertainment	providing unlimited opportunities for education- indeed for	the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the	fullest	7020.822375252838
4301. mankind as a result attains previously undreamed of levels	of civilization and culture a golden age which the overlords a very	evident symbol of science have helped produce by introducing reason	and the scientific method into human activities	4052.809977163227
4302. thus science is the	savior of mankind and in this respect childhood's end only	blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which though not	always so directly stated	has nevertheless been present in the minds	of most science-fiction writers	6441.543170444612
4303. considering then the optimism	which has permeated science fiction for so long what is really remarkable	is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers	have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future	have attacked the childhood's end kind of faith that science	and technology will inevitably better the human condition	5294.675498409938
4304. and they	have done this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novels	and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure	with dystopian elements	4653.602026538951
4305. because of the means of publication- science-fiction	magazines and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science	fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent	of this phenomenon can hardly be known though one fact is evident:	the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations	4811.759381396234
4306. among the dystopias for example isaac asimov's the	caves of steel portrays the deadly effects on human life	of the super-city of the future; james blish's a case of conscience	describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction	in underground shelters; ray bradbury's fahrenheit	451 presents a book-burning society in which wall television	and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; walter m miller	jr's a canticle for leibowitz finds men after	the great atomic disaster stumbling back to their previous level of	civilization and another catastrophe; frederick pohl's the midas	touch predicts an economy of abundance which in order	to remain prosperous must set its robots to consuming surplus production;	clifford d simak's how-2 tells of a future	when robots have taken over leaving men nothing to do; and robert	sheckley's the status civilization describes a world	which frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it	becomes static and conformist	0.30166232349522504
4307. a more complete list would also include	bradbury's the pedestrian philip k	dick's	solar lottery wilson	tucker's the long loud silence jack vance's	to live forever	gore vidal's messiah and	bernard wolfe's limbo as well as the three perhaps most	outstanding dystopias frederik pohl and c m kornbluth's	the space merchants kurt vonnegut's player	piano works which	we will later examine in detail	5668.11859361769
4308. the novels and stories like pohl's	drunkard's walk with the focus on adventure and	with the dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case an	uneasy overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting	routine jobs while a carefully selected university-trained elite	runs everything- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias	7903.414830026576
4309. there is of course nothing new about dystopias for they belong	to a literary tradition which including also the closely related satiric	utopias stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century	and swift's gulliver's travels to the twentieth century	and zamiatin's we capek's war with the newts huxley's	brave new world e m forster's the machine	stops c s lewis's that hideous strength	and orwell's nineteen eighty-four and which in science fiction	is represented	before the present deluge as early as wells's trilogy the	time machine a story of the days to come and when	the sleeper wakes and as recently as jack williamson's with	folded hands the classic story of men replaced by their	own robots	0.20124717349522497
4310. what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so	many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing	works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life	5166.62244524354
4311. since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the	last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief	impetus was the 1949 publication of nineteen eighty-four an assumption	which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as	room 101 along with education by conditioning from brave new world	a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned	with new interest after reading the more powerful orwell dystopia	0.20124717349522497
4312. not all recent science fiction however is dystopian for the	optimistic strain is still very much alive in mission of gravity	and childhood's end as we have seen as well as in many other	recent popular novels and stories like fred hoyle's the black	cloud; and among works of dystopian science fiction not	all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature-	but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction	0.30166232349522504
4313. in addition there are many areas of the human situation besides	the impact of science and technology which are examined for science-fiction	dystopias often extrapolate political social economic tendencies	only indirectly related to science and technology	3844.1029823041326
4314. nevertheless	with all these qualifications and exceptions the current dystopian	phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology	instead of bringing utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even	destroy men	5182.4378184299585
4315. how effectively these warnings can be presented is seen	in pohl and kornbluth's the space merchants vonnegut's	player piano and wyndham's re-birth	2174.7547201630814
4316. easily	the best known of these three novels is the space merchants a	good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more	than the impact of science on human life though its most important	warning is in this area namely as to the use to which discoveries in	the behavioral sciences may be put	7862.798349774998
4317. the novel which is not merely dystopian	but also brilliantly satiric describes a future america where	one-sixteenth of the population the men who run advertising agencies	and big corporations control the rest of the people the submerged	fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers with the government	being no more than a clearing house for pressures	5325.417851509169
4318. like	ours the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order	to survive and like ours it is based on the principle of ever	increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption	5774.304886634885
4319. the consequences of course have been dreadful: reckless expansion	has led to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion	of its natural resources	2309.7584843784102
4320. for example even the most successful executive	lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in	the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night; soyaburgers	have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is	saved for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled that	no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs	8638.213483158046
4321. while the space merchants indicates as kingsley amis has	correctly observed some of the impending consequences of the growth	of industrial and commercial power and satirizes existing habits	in the advertising profession its warning and analysis penetrate	much deeper	4123.006490203128
4322. what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is	an outrage an assault on people's mental privacy or that it	is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains	a coercive tendency	6202.102013739312
4323. rather what kornbluth	and pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent	in perfecting a science of man and his motives	2330.589954182945
4324. the space	merchants like such humanist documents as joseph wood krutch's	the measure of man and c s lewis's the abolition	of man considers what may result from the scientific study	of human nature	5483.650460127931
4325. if man is actually the product of his environment	and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which	environment determines what people do then someone- a someone	probably standing outside traditional systems of values- can turn around	and develop completely efficient means for controlling people	5019.6286034160685
4326. thus	we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners	and the controlled	1651.7384900448815
4327. and this of course is exactly what madison avenue	has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way with its hidden	persuaders and what the space merchants accomplish with much	greater sophistication and precision	3766.4874701146737
4328. pohl and kornbluth's	ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques	of advertising which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis	in american life which work on the libido of consumers which	are linked to the great prime motivations of the human spirit	7342.026598745928
4329. as the hero mitchell courtenay explains before his conversion	the job of advertising is to convince people without letting them	know that they're being convinced	2599.459839533222
4330. and to do this requires first	of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the	scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research who for	example tell courtenay that three days is the optimum priming period	for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase-	which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send	an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine	it	0.30166232349522504
4331. and the second requirement for convincing people without	their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which	persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered	3235.4210513348526
4332. thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the	person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet the person capable	of putting together words that stir and move and sing	5768.832337441345
4333. as	courtenay explains here in this profession we reach into the souls	of men and women	1259.464394182496
4334. and we do it by taking talent- and redirecting	it	561.9275628166095
4335. now the basic question to be asked in this situation	is what motivates the manipulators that is what are their values	2013.8468816983998
4336. -	since as courtenay says nobody should play with lives the way	we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals	1823.3589340596252
4337. but the only	ideal he can think of is sales! indeed again and again the	space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners	and behavioral scientists once they have seen through human	nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide	them	4762.71906508939
4338. we often say of a person that he looks young for his age	or old for his age	2368.930000242162
4339. yet even in the more extreme of such cases	we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is	2179.758487941567
4340. and	this means i suppose that almost invariably age reveals itself by	easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind	3492.979614971448
4341. young	for his age means only the presence of some minor characteristic	not quite usual	1100.9845312928935
4342. stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless	there	248.64704762886262
4343. an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful	characteristics deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed	hair	2043.9173029989083
4344. looking young for your age means for your age and	it means no more	1417.0159949488207
4345. a mind expressing itself in words may reveal	itself a little less obviously as old or young	1420.5124058537167
4346. its surface loses its	bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious	than the body does	2587.1855021531146
4347. youth may be and often is skeptical cynical or	despairing; age may be idealistic believing and much given to professions	of optimism	2180.193525988634
4348. but there is nevertheless always a subtle difference	in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held	2339.9888658238865
4349. the	pessimism of the young is defiant anxious to confess or even exaggerate	its ostensible gloom and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that	it regards	its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate	for the awfulness of that truth	4823.669609551802
4350. similarly the optimism of age	protests too much	250.33514190195075
4351. if it proclaims that the best is yet to be it always	arouses at least in the young either a suspicious question or perhaps	the exclamation of the negro youth who saw on a tombstone the	inscription i am not dead but sleeping	4461.679428384732
4352. boy you ain't fooling	nobody but yourself	141.13380606760677
4353. we may say of some unfortunates	that they were never young	499.23591253461547
4354. we cannot truthfully say of anyone who has	succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old	2796.6921904706755
4355. those famous lines of the greek anthology with which a fading beauty	dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude:	venus take my votive glass since i am not what i was what	from this day i shall be venus let me never see	4880.153082726692
4356. no	good can come of contemplating the sad inevitable fact that once youth	has passed a worse and worse time still succeeds the former	3680.530161252756
4357. but there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind	in even a cracked mirror	1265.5109459728035
4358. one is that there sometimes are real although	inadequate compensations in growing old	1178.9843369734695
4359. serenity if one is fortunate	enough to achieve it is not so good as joy but it is something	1723.5101295518223
4360. even to be from hope and fear set free is at least better than	to have lost the first without having got rid of the second	4091.9291981734323
4361. the other	reason is that one thus	becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion or change of opinion	whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of	the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all	too obvious physical differences	4841.513473863186
4362. one may be exasperatingly aware	that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of	one's own age	3480.6340443188215
4363. but at least the question has been raised	166.84207157198267
4364. many readers	of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for	the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they	have never actually been told what my age is	5466.241538491206
4365. at least i should like	them to know that i know these discounts are being made	1261.6777749748665
4366. let	me then glance into the mirror	142.47788147591282
4367. i have known some	men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember	seem utter strangers to them now; that their remote past is as	discontinuous with their present selves as lacking in any conscious	likeness to their mature personality as the self of a butterfly may be	imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was	5703.5148053154935
4368. for	my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs	1405.0480232632558
4369. i	have changed and i have reversed opinions; but i am so aware of an	uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that i see only as absurd	the tendency of some psychologists from heraclitus to pirandello	and proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which	nothing remains unchanged	5162.653852481712
4370. so far as i am concerned the child is	unmistakably father to the man despite the obvious fact that child and	father differ greatly- sometimes for the better and sometimes for	the worse	5330.701381338926
4371. fundamental values temperament and the way in which	one approaches a conviction change less of course than specific opinions	1720.84968023648
4372. that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many	present-day intellectuals who were communists or near-communists in	their youth and are now so extremely conservative	that they can define no important political conviction	that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make	the distinction between mr nixon and mr khrushchev for them	hardly worth noting	8469.48593022251
4373. but in ways more fundamental than specific political	opinions they are still what they always were: passionate sure	without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of capable	of seeing black and white only and therefore committed to the	logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to	5218.510165889552
4374. to those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally or	politically or sociologically antiquated	i would like to say what i have already	hinted namely that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some	discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore	incapable of being youthful of mind	8104.614054345674
4375. but i will also remind them that	i have always been inclined to skepticism to a kind of laodicean	lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned; so that	although not as eager as i once was to be disapproved of i can still	resist prevailing opinions	4872.107997452889
4376. at about the age of twelve i became	a spencerian liberal and i have always considered myself a liberal	of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since	spencer became a reactionary	5501.4876160523545
4377. several times in my youth i voted	the socialist ticket but less because i was socialist than because	i was not either a republican or a democrat and i voted for	franklin roosevelt every time he was a candidate	4130.026647232846
4378. yet during the years	when i was on the staff of the nation i tried to the limit	the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted	to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social	question	6818.355810450421
4379. never once during the trying thirties did i come so	close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant russian	communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums an interesting	experiment	3564.7304023120278
4380. there are few things of which i am prouder than	of that unblemished record	1398.4121851272
4381. many of my friends at the time thought that	i had received a well-deserved condemnation when lincoln steffens	denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of	the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead	past	4707.466927228443
4382. but he as i can now retort was the man who could see so	short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he gave voice to	the famous exclamation: i have seen the future and it works	6196.60962234227
4383. the favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval	of communism is that they did not know how things would develop	2300.805065947145
4384. with	this excuse i have never been much impressed	390.5533858366676
4385. there was it seems	to me enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of russian	leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait	to see how it would turn out	3529.5322251003977
4386. once many years ago i sat at dinner	next to arthur train and the subject of the nation came	up	2820.3339421254864
4387. he asked me suddenly what are your political opinions	259.9896678476999
4388. well i replied some of my colleagues on the paper regard	me as a rank reactionary	1898.8765560580196
4389. after a moment's thought he replied	that still leaves you a lot of latitude	938.186731595116
4390. and i suppose it	did	21.979364363366667
4391. i never have been and am not now any kind of utopian	636.2368107925588
4392. when	i first came across samuel johnson's pronouncement the remedy	for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical it seemed	to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths	5435.603748881158
4393. it	will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any	other phrase or principle could	1415.0391843114826
4394. why did i choose to fill these	pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous	reflections and autobiography	3043.600143550608
4395. the reason is i think my awareness	that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm	the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets	us nowhere and that i am simply too old to hope	4443.849842879415
4396. i would however	like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see	dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever	since i can remember and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon	6443.6880905175185
4397. i know that one must act	43.76301499357288
4398. but one need not always be sure that the	action is either wise or conclusive	1644.2754114781662
4399. apropos of what some would	call cynicism i remember an anecdote the source of which i forget	1423.1015352064073
4400. it concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object	lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside	his church door	4275.111288499156
4401. not only his parishioners but the whole town and	ultimately the whole county were enormously impressed by this object	lesson	1878.2289444317091
4402. one day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators	who wanted to know his secret	2105.908960508085
4403. how on earth do you manage it	94.60763649028945
4404. what is the trick	4.412644178111182
4405. why he replied it is perfectly simple;	there is no trick involved	641.3762231614539
4406. all you have to do is put in a fresh	lamb from time to time	1651.9172879739115
4407. cynical	0.20041515
4408. blasphemous	0.30041514999999996
4409. not really	it seems to me	42.91522108977849
4410. the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down	together was given in the future tense	2361.2227745348573
4411. it is not something that can	be expected to happen now	500.12655639705974
4412. without really changing the general	subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by	doubts not only about pacifism but also when asked to join in the protest	against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane	and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous; namely the law	that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no	extenuating circumstances	8789.371759636317
4413. it is not that i am unaware of the force	of their strongest contention	933.9894946295074
4414. life they say should be regarded as	sacred and therefore as something that neither an individual nor his	society has a right to take away	3916.7256747526103
4415. in fact i cannot imagine myself	condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if i had to take	as an individual the responsibility for his death	3122.2132219782843
4416. just as i know	i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot sincerely call myself	a pacifist so too i would not be either a hangman by profession or	if i could avoid it even a member of a hanging jury	6746.830119096371
4417. despite these	facts the question should no murderer ever be executed	503.0465535727684
4418. seems	to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a	simple negative answer	2361.9855319460435
4419. punishment of the wrongdoer so liberals	are inclined to say can have only three possible justifications:	revenge reformation or deterrent example	2040.9490550117248
4420. for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to	counterbalance existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to	the tarnished image of the species man or as malraux himself puts	it to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves	7007.731040799375
4421. andre malraux's the walnut trees of altenburg	was written in the early years of the second world war during	a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the germans	after the fall of france	3930.180182991656
4422. the manuscript presumably after being	smuggled out of the country was published in switzerland in 1943	1877.8755424069009
4423. the work as it stands is not the entire book that malraux wrote at that	time- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called	la lutte avec l'ange; and this first section was somehow preserved	when the gestapo destroyed the rest	4526.524030669996
4424. if we are to believe the list of titles printed in malraux's latest	book la metamorphose des dieux vol 1 he is	still	engaged in writing a large novel under his original title	5325.275640664054
4425. but as he	remarks in his preface to the walnut trees a novel can hardly	ever be rewritten and when this one appears in its final form	the form of the first part h will no doubt be radically changed	4227.932346254653
4426. malraux pretends perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty	that his fragmentary work will accordingly appeal only to the	curiosity of bibliophiles	and to connoisseurs of what might have	been	5008.266480052635
4427. even in its present form however the first part of malraux's	unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth	century literature; and it should be far better known than it is	3450.291511502504
4428. the theme of the walnut trees of altenburg is most closely	related to its immediate predecessor in malraux's array of novels:	man's hope	3476.8864060924484
4429. this magnificent but greatly underestimated	book which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time	as no other comparable creation has suffered severely from having	been written about an historical event- the spanish civil war-	that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political	feuds	4971.328151750537
4430. even so apparently impartial a critic as w h frohock	has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece	of loyalist propaganda; and has then gone on to argue with unimpeachable	consistency that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects	of the book are simply inadvertent contradictions	7362.226603838864
4431. nothing	however could be farther from the truth	168.64124000111693
4432. the whole purpose of	man's hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and	ends inherent in all organized political violence- and even when such	violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty justice	and human dignity	6182.27598569844
4433. nowhere before in malraux's pages have we	met such impassioned defenders of a quality of man which transcends	the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether-	both the action of malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like perken	and garine and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated communists	like kyo gisors and katow in man's fate	5275.142866896626
4434. man engages	only a small part of himself in an action says old alvear the art-historian;	and the more the action claims to be total the smaller	is the part of man engaged	5337.003881873938
4435. these lines never cease to haunt	the book amidst all the exaltations of combat and to make an appeal for	a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal	necessities of war	3848.3486470811295
4436. it is this larger theme of the quality	of man a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into	the human which now forms the pulsating heart of malraux's	artistic universe	4983.732161169662
4437. malraux to be sure does not abandon the world	of violence combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as	a creative artist and which is the only world apparently in which	his imagination can flame into life	4145.104151350425
4438. the walnut trees of altenburg	includes not one war but two and throws in a turkish revolution	along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure	4477.922372672703
4439. but	while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that malraux wishes	to express these values are no longer linked with the triumph or	defeat of any cause- whether that of an individual assertion of the	will-to-power or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation	of oppression- as their necessary condition	5183.508654260867
4440. on the contrary the	frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the	sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance	of a caravaggio	4995.721984168328
4441. the walnut trees of altenburg	is composed in the form of a triptych with the two small side panels	framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel	3121.7605957888227
4442. this	central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period	from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war	4283.420937572639
4443. the framing scenes on the other hand both take place in the late	spring of 1940 just at the moment of the defeat of france in the	second great world conflict	3328.9152273813825
4444. the narrator is an alsatian serving with	the french army and he has the same name that malraux	himself was later to use in the resistance; like malraux he was also	serving in the tank corps before being captured and we learn as well	that in civilian life he had been a writer	7730.013610621437
4445. these biographical analogies	are obvious and far too much time has been spent speculating	on their possible implications	1569.1379384338657
4446. much more important is to grasp	the feelings of the narrator as he	becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of french prisoners	clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral	of chartres	6064.07738417531
4447. for as his companions gradually dissolve back	into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity as they	lose all the appanage of their acquired culture he is overcome by	the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind	4552.6694310737375
4448. as a writer by what have i been obsessed these last ten	years if not by mankind	2119.9586351834178
4449. here i am face to face with the primeval	stuff	374.4428487922552
4450. the intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening	pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of	the text; and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been	done	5341.809666312435
4451. what does the narrator see and what does he feel	375.52477474985545
4452. a good many	pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged	determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families-	even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing	the letters to blow away in the wind	7101.453417729435
4453. awkwardly and laboriously in stiff	unemotional phrases the soldiers continue to bridge the distance	between themselves and those they love; they instinctively struggle	to keep open a road to the future in their hearts	3657.288821503241
4454. and by a skillful	and unobtrusive use of imagery	stockade the hastily erected lean-to is a babylonian hovel	the men begin to look like peruvian mummies and to acquire	malraux projects a fresco of human endurance-	which is also the endurance of the human- stretching backward into	the dark abyss of time	7636.99196465875
4455. the narrator feels himself catching a glimpse	of pre-history learning of man's age-old familiarity with misfortune	as well as his equally age-old ingenuity his secret	faith in endurance however crammed with catastrophes the same faith	perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine	4765.258482976459
4456. this new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied	by a re-vision of his previous view	2587.7942120818534
4457. i thought i knew more than	my education had taught me notes the narrator because i had encountered	the militant mobs of a political or religious faith	2853.970132095907
4458. is	this not malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with	the ideological	1411.9907968175198
4459. but now he knows that an intellectual is not only	a man to whom books are necessary he is any man whose reasoning	however elementary it may be affects and directs his life	3542.5680203977477
4460. from this	point of view the militant mobs of the past stirred into action	by one ideology or another were all composed of intellectuals-	and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be	discovered	6191.079356087066
4461. the men around him observes the narrator have been	living from day to day for thousands of years	1577.1039582764463
4462. the human is deeper	than a mass ideology certainly deeper than the isolated individual;	and the narrator recalls the words of his father vincent berger:	it is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one	finally comes down to mankind	6676.181106758699
4463. the entire middle section	of the walnut trees is taken up with the life of vincent berger	himself whose fragmentary notes on his encounters with mankind	are now conveyed by his son	3437.532921086593
4464. he was not much older than myself	writes the narrator when he began to feel the impact of that human	mystery which now obsesses me and which makes me begin perhaps	to understand him	5471.297790465541
4465. for the figure of vincent berger malraux has	obviously drawn on his studies of t e lawrence	and like	both lawrence and malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of nietzsche	3327.449710568582
4466. a professor at the university of constantinople where his first	course of lectures was on nietzsche and the philosophy of action	vincent berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the	german embassy in turkey	5620.253062443207
4467. as an alsatian before the first world	war he was of course of german nationality; but he quickly involves	himself in the young turk revolutionary movement to such an extent	that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism	4114.039487046188
4468. and after becoming	the right-hand man of enver pasha he is sent by the latter	to pave the way for a new turkish empire embracing the union of all	turks throughout central asia from adrianople to the chinese oases	on the silk trade route	6822.5293424069505
4469. vincent berger's mission	is a failure because the ottoman nationalism on which enver pasha	counted does not exist	1572.3102364988006
4470. central asia is sunk in a somnolence from which	nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing	human any longer seemed to survive vincent berger begins to dream	of the occident	5594.026533093434
4471. oh for the green of europe! trains whistling	in the night the rattle and clatter of cabs h	1577.9127736098048
4472. finally after	almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could not fight back	because madmen are sacred to islam- he throws up his mission and	returns to europe	4838.079283637399
4473. this has been his first encounter with mankind and	although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular european	press it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied	2854.8080648933274
4474. despite berger's	report enver pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a turkish blood	alliance; and vincent berger learns that political ambition	is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men	5469.659246036839
4475. but as he discovers	shortly on returning among intellectuals obsessed by le culte	du moi his experience of action had also taught him a more positive	lesson	2870.409475459473
4476. for six years my father had had to do too much commanding	and convincing writes the narrator not to understand that man	begins with 'the other'	4106.84903174142
4477. and when vincent berger returns	to europe this first result of his encounters with mankind is	considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation	2449.3628909176427
4478. for a dawning	sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which	as so often in malraux suddenly confront a character with the existential	question of the nature and value of human life	5479.488079140508
4479. one such event	is the landing in europe itself when the mingled familiarity and strangeness	of the occident after the blank immensities of asia shocks	the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities	of human life	4048.129567293819
4480. in a pessimistic assessment of the cold war eden declared: there	must be much closer unity within the west before there can be effective	negotiation with the east	4461.004652519205
4481. ordinary methods of diplomacy within	the free world are inadequate said the former prime minister	1108.200900513614
4482. something much more thorough is required	65.2869147275764
4483. citing the experience	of the combined chiefs of staff in world war 2 eden said	that all would have been confusion and disarray without them	2587.2365519819205
4484. this	he said is exactly what has been happening between the politically	free nations in the postwar world	2364.8835006391737
4485. we need joint chiefs of a political	general staff	263.0945341826368
4486. citing the advances of communist power in	recent years sir anthony observed: this very grave state of	affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality	of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources	to meet it	6692.7337207583305
4487. while i fully agree with sir anthony's	contention i think that we must carry the analysis farther bearing	in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our need	the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the	measure of our capacity	4806.794482504605
4488. while it is hazardous to project	the trend of history it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully	emerging in the western world particularly among the countries	of western europe	4979.32866722591
4489. at the end of world war 2 free europe was	ready for a new beginning	1096.7985928981075
4490. the excesses of nationalism had brought	down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the	old order of things seemed unthinkable	4099.016679979066
4491. under these conditions a new	generation of europeans began to discover the bonds of long association	and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist	xenophobia	3098.733444237442
4492. a slow and painful trend toward unification has taken	hold a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which	may also lead to a binding federation of europe	5143.89624287936
4493. it may well be	that the unification of europe will prove inadequate that the survival	of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of	the entire western world	3218.0601289451415
4494. the movement toward european unity	has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism	one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe the	other building on wartime precedents of practical coo^peration for the	solution of specific problems	6311.04229184181
4495. thus far the advances made have been	almost entirely along functional lines	636.9670840259071
4496. many factors contributed	to the growth of the european movement	556.7883015615631
4497. in 1946 sir winston churchill	who had spoken often of european union during the war advocated	the formation of a kind of united states of europe	2710.3371459033433
4498. had	churchill been returned to office in 1945 it is just possible that	britain instead of standing fearfully aloof would have led europe	toward union	3891.585475029047
4499. in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive	coo^rdinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation	of the organization for european economic coo^peration to supervise	and coo^rdinate the uses of american aid under the marshall	plan	4032.7580565433846
4500. the united states might well have exploited the opportunity	provided by the european recovery program to push the hesitant european	nations toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration	but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united	states government at the time	6912.324475455591
4501. another powerful factor in	the european movement was the threat of soviet aggression	780.5341677664574
4502. the communist	coup in czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the	conclusion of the brussels treaty a 50-year alliance among britain	france and the benelux countries	4273.308055101217
4503. and of course the soviet threat	was responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic	nations	1412.3559142978663
4504. new organs of unification proliferated in the decade	following the conclusion of the nato alliance	1646.1217995777174
4505. in 1949 the council	of europe came into existence a purely consultative parliamentary	body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity	2452.7388994557277
4506. in 1952 the european coal and steel community was launched	placing the coal and steel production of france west germany italy	and benelux under a supranational high authority	4463.250535528192
4507. for a time it	appeared that a common european army might be created but the project	for a european defense community was rejected by the french national	assembly in 1954	3210.493406245676
4508. in 1957 the social-economic approach to european	integration was capped by the formation among the six of	a tariff-free european common market and euratom for coo^peration	in the development of atomic energy	5154.843887164618
4509. the overseas democracies	have generally encouraged the european unification movement	without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation	in a broader atlantic community	2600.4437331457793
4510. the united states and canada	belong only to nato and the new oecd	1188.0180098241422
4511. britain	until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of	the groom at a shotgun wedding	1880.6257385945723
4512. in other areas it held back pleading	its commonwealth bonds	557.4831326826336
4513. now britain has decided to seek admission	to the european economic community and it seems certain that she will	be joined by some of her partners in the loose free trade area	of the outer seven	3842.984884777967
4514. besides its historical significance as a	break with the centuries-old tradition of british insularity britain's	move if successful will constitute an historic landmark of the	first importance in the movement toward the unification of europe and	the western world	6210.279769724414
4515. if a broader atlantic community is to	be formed- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both	our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand	in the nato alliance	4124.14814139368
4516. the time is now ripe indeed overdue	for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities for	its development as an instrument of atlantic community	3676.808578799852
4517. what is required	is the full implementation of article 2 of the treaty which	provides: the parties will contribute toward the further development	of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening	their free institutions by bringing about a better understanding of	the principles upon which these institutions are founded and by promoting	conditions of stability and well-being	5376.742740718453
4518. they will seek to eliminate	conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage	economic collaboration between any and all of them	3247.237049512786
4519. as lester	pearson wrote in 1955: nato cannot live on fear alone	642.2360042580988
4520. it	cannot become the source of a real atlantic community if it remains	organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought	it into being	4295.021477610504
4521. the problem of nato is not one of machinery	of which there is an abundance but of the will to use it	2167.804092958392
4522. the	nato council is available as an executive agency the standing	group as a high military authority	2145.2764509372637
4523. the unofficial conference of	parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority	648.7496128109132
4524. this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community	by fiat but only when that community evolves from potentiality to	reality	3469.2260659056055
4525. the existence of a community is a state of mind- a conviction	that goals and values are widely shared that effective communication	is possible that mutual trust is reasonably assured	3228.559957060618
4526. an	equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the	development and expansion of the oecd conceived as	an organ of economic coo^peration there is no reason why oecd	cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members	so desire	6691.972449699175
4527. indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato	for the development of a parliamentary organ of the atlantic	nations because it could encompass all of the members of the atlantic	community including those like sweden and switzerland who	are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like	nato	5077.55666072183
4528. underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a	conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form	a community at least a potential community	4110.758975097597
4529. there is nothing new	in this; what is new and compelling is that the west is now but one	of several powerful civilizations or systems and that one or	more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the west	4320.657945510974
4530. for centuries	the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they	did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other	3709.5051077106846
4531. that time	is now past and the atlantic nations if they are to survive must develop	a full-fledged community and they must also look beyond the frontiers	of western civilization toward a world-wide concert of	free nations	3956.932120587415
4532. the burden of these reflections is that	a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs	3059.966338572332
4533. and if we do not aspire to too much it is also within our capacity	1098.7447572029546
4534. a realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization	on the one hand and our capacity to achieve them on the other	must be approached through the concept of community	5294.287760749913
4535. history	has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on	the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external	danger ceases to be dramatically urgent	3335.887646337052
4536. only when a concert of	nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values	is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy	4278.367438732343
4537. it follows	that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is	only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation	and coo^rdination	3241.4144079816733
4538. it is very much a matter of building	the foundations of community	957.0860592722856
4539. it is for these reasons that proposals	for a new world order through radical overhaul of the united	nations or through some sort of world federation are utterly	fatuous	3121.5386539045367
4540. in a recent book called world peace through world law	two distinguished lawyers grenville clark and louis sohn call	for just such an overhaul of the un basing their case on	the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust	6082.02105821502
4541. i believe that these proposals	however meritorious in terms of world needs go far beyond our	capacity to realize them	1869.1568296431567
4542. such proposals look to an apocalyptic act	a kind of lockian social contract on a world-wide scale	2130.218185329501
4543. the	defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their	assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible	2597.1961026854524
4544. a working concept of the organic evolution of community	must lead us in a different direction	1865.625426987636
4545. the failures of the un	and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond	what was internationally feasible	2012.869147186584
4546. our problem therefore is to	devise processes more modest in their aspirations adjusted to the real	world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities	4101.163897917113
4547. the history of the un demonstrates that in a pluralistic	world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than	coercion	2180.2802856471967
4548. it is possible that international organization will ultimately	supplant the multi-state system but its proper function for the	immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to	render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world	6041.59837222181
4549. new machinery of coo^rdination should not be our primary objective	in	the foreseeable future- though perhaps the political general staff	of western leaders proposed by sir anthony eden would serve	a useful purpose	3560.74161084108
4550. generally however there is an abundance of available	machinery of coo^rdination- in nato in oecd	in the un and elsewhere	2819.031440387049
4551. the trouble with this machinery	is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence	of a conscious sense of community among the free nations	3441.829212356967
4552. our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the	realization of a potential community	2126.367409281894
4553. a concert of free nations	should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century	concert of europe with its common values and accepted rules	of the game	3107.6804562517436
4554. constitutions of and by themselves mean little; the	history of both the league of nations and the united nations demonstrates	that	3056.3936570497826
4555. but a powerful sense of community even with little	or no machinery means a great deal	1262.602639384333
4556. that is the lesson of the nineteenth	century	251.8082683455213
4557. a realistic concert of free nations might	be expected to consist of an inner community of the north atlantic	nations and an outer community embracing much or all of the	non-communist world	3445.694028026183
4558. the recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement	seen by some as part of the san francisco renaissance have	been as popular as they are notorious	4077.4989954319235
4559. it might well start a craze	like swallowing goldfish or pee wee golf wrote kenneth rexroth	in an explanatory note in the evergreen review and he may have	been right	3233.4728445470782
4560. under the general heading poetry-and-jazz widely	divergent experiments have been carried out	949.887196301356
4561. lawrence ferlenghetti	and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry	for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical	forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician	3658.403231923814
4562. even musicians themselves	have taken to writing poetry	248.07379631611357
4563. but the best known exploiters	of the new medium are kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen	1096.8257719692615
4564. rexroth	and patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments	964.0127908276903
4565. rexroth is a longtime jazz buff a name-dropper of jazz heroes	and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz	2035.0342703266506
4566. in san francisco	he has worked with brew moore charlie mingus and other	swinging musicians of secure reputation thus placing himself within	established jazz traditions in addition to being a part of the	san francisco school	5755.299402681162
4567. although patchen has given previous	evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he works	with the chamber jazz sextet is often ignored by jazz critics	2987.2541523792806
4568. did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen	the	stated goal of the cjs is the synthesis of jazz and serious	music	3477.2857056013645
4569. patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles	and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry	group maintaining a self-imposed isolation even though his conversion	to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first	appear	4304.683389775543
4570. he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 and	his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with	the form and presentation of his poetry	4664.304672897059
4571. however his subject matter	and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent and these together	with certain key poetic images may be traced through all his	work including the new jazz experiments	3338.922920522937
4572. from the beginning of	his career patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry	1414.001966268197
4573. his first book before the brave is a collection	of poems that are almost all communistic but after publication of this	book he rejected	communism and advocated a pacifistic anarchy though	retaining his revolutionary idiom	3758.5858271995226
4574. he spoke for a proletariat	that included all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth	2119.07660823306
4575. patchen	believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and	money-hungry people	789.8515811938817
4576. running counter to the destroying forces in the	world are all the virtues that are innate in man the capacity for love	and brotherhood the ability to appreciate beauty	4665.291654126959
4577. beauty as well	as love is redemptive and patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation	1101.9193399903636
4578. this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven	756.4505647703448
4579. in	patchen's eyes organized churches are as odious as organized governments	and christian symbols having been taken over by the moneyed	classes are now agents of corruption	2868.8437722056015
4580. patchen envisions a dark kingdom	which stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger	from his own kind	3060.5693224783163
4581. the dark kingdom sends angels of death	and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness	1408.8879667140834
4582. actually	heaven and the dark kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of	heavenly life after death	1896.1424663939251
4583. patchen has almost never used strict	poetic forms; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making	1096.005172247704
4584. much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a pseudo-anthropological	myth reference which is concerned with imaginary places	and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language	4474.122255459144
4585. these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying	to patchen	370.63102792947865
4586. beginning in cloth of the tempest he experimented	in merging poetry and visual art using drawings to carry long	narrative segments of a story as in sleepers awake and constructing	elaborate poems-in-drawing-and-type in which it is impossible	to distinguish between	the art and the poetry	6924.228669109037
4587. art makings	or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of patchen's requirements	for a poetic frame of reference	1566.623032130008
4588. many of his poems purported	to be exactly contemporary and political; so during the period approximately	from 1941 to 1946 patchen often used private detective stories	as a myth reference and the private eye as a myth hero	6090.065982753471
4589. speaking	in terms of sociological stereotype the private eye might	appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons	2176.988445003258
4590. the private	detective	is an individual hero fighting injustice	395.33497775357137
4591. he is usually	something of an underdog he must battle the organized police force as	well as recognized criminals	1735.0521549341597
4592. the private detective must rely as the	youngest son or trickster hero does in primitive myth on his wits	2595.243988315965
4593. the private detective is militant against injustice a humorous	and ironic explorer of the underworld; most important to patchen he	was a non-literary hero and very contemporary	2852.0240861100297
4594. in 1945 probably almost	every american not only knew who sam spade was but had some	kind of emotional feeling about him	3253.2437516005784
4595. in the memoirs of a shy pornographer	patchen exploited this national sentiment by making	his hero albert budd a private detective	2030.6705268011963
4596. but since 1945	sam spade has undergone a metamorphosis; he has become friday	on dragnet a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority	3070.0846848381398
4597. he has	like so many other secular and religious culture symbols gone over to	the side of the ruling classes	1886.3418082705332
4598. obviously the private eye can	have no more appeal for patchen	753.3931823165027
4599. to fill the job of contemporary hero	in 1955 patchen needed someone else	784.2813772372574
4600. it was logical that	he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician	1889.076024254296
4601. the revolution	in jazz that took place around 1949 the evolution from the bebop	school of dizzy gillespie to the cool sound of miles	davis and lennie tristano lee konitz and the whole legend of	charlie parker had made an impression on many academic and literary	men	4786.587243711047
4602. the differentiation between the east coast and west coast schools	of jazz the differences between the hard bop school of rollins	and the cerebral experiments of tristano konitz and	marsh the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians	all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public	7725.877371883122
4603. the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger	generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the	merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union	of graphic art and poetry	4321.440499400533
4604. in addition to his experiments in reading	poetry to jazz patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern	jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the	private detective a decade ago	6464.505969587387
4605. in this respect his approach to poetry-and-jazz	is in marked contrast to kenneth rexroth's	934.1171049886241
4606. rexroth	uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz including many of	his chinese and japanese translations; he usually draws some kind	of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading-	for instance he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an oriental	courtesan waiting for the man she loves and who never comes	and the old blues chants of ma rainy and other negro singers- but	usually the comparison is specious	0.30166232349522504
4607. rexroth may sometimes achieve an	effective juxtaposition but he rarely makes any effort to capture any	jazz feeling in the text of his poems relying on his very competent	musicians to supply this feeling	3649.9579533856217
4608. patchen does read some	of his earlier works to music but he has written an entire book of	short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz	4831.298285969884
4609. these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians	but they show changes in patchen's approach to his poetry	for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude	of the jazz musician	4213.9316779846495
4610. it is difficult to draw the line between	stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician	1882.0781643021444
4611. everyone knows that	private detectives in real life are not like sam spade and pat novak	but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked	2742.4102934719776
4612. seen	by the public the musician is the underdog par excellence	759.2140167877674
4613. he	is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to	live	1244.3323328507895
4614. his approach to music is highly individualistic; the accent	is on improvisation rather than arrangements	1655.7232980215347
4615. while he is worldly the	musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment	and naivete	1106.037718428313
4616. the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he	is far from being a literary hero yet is a creative artist	2607.490047323157
4617. many of	these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective	but where the detective is active and militant the jazz musician	is passive almost a victim of society	3570.219663172056
4618. in order to write with authority	either about musicians or as a musician patchen would have to soft	pedal his characteristically outspoken anger and change	from a revolutionary to a victim	5029.686214813716
4619. he	must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world but	who declines doing anything about it	1884.385509043924
4620. this involves a shift in	patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz	poetry	2603.9814367959357
4621. he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest	symbols and devices to the new work and the fact that he has kept a	body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected	continuity to his poetry	4217.756235322826
4622. perhaps tracing some of these more important	symbols through the body of his work will show that patchen's	new poetry is well thought out and remains within the mainstream	of his work while being suited to a new form	6201.07271098767
4623. henry miller characterized	patchen as a man of anger and light	503.43327168005214
4624. his revolutionary	anger is apparent in most of his early poems	750.6591941490872
4625. the following passage	from the hangman's great hands illustrates the directness	of this anger	945.2162205854842
4626. i was born angry	4.407055748209976
4627. angry	that my father was being burnt alive in the mills; angry that none	of us knew anything but filth and poverty	2158.696284932671
4628. angry because i was that	very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for	1404.9749805892804
4629. this	angry and exasperated stance which patchen has maintained in his poetry	for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind	of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval	of the modern world	4229.613612618025
4630. in his recent book hurray for anything	one of the most important short poems- and it is the title	poem for one of the long jazz arrangements- is written for recital	with jazz	5344.409058905172
4631. although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues	to be sung the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling	2040.224055459187
4632. i	went to the city and there i did weep men a-crowing likes asses	and living like sheep	2358.5229065411036
4633. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her little white han! yes i went to the city and	there i did bitterly cry men out of touch with the earth and	with never a glance at the sky	4311.987134927246
4634. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her pure little han'! patchen is still	the rebel but he writes in a doleful mournful tone	4302.803383536373
4635. neither of these	poems is an aberration; each is so typical that it represents a prominent	trend in the poet's development	2042.522642876739
4636. patchen is repeatedly	preoccupied with death	65.28052330176878
4637. in many of his poems death comes by train:	a strongly evocative visual image	936.9253442720121
4638. perhaps patchen was once involved	in a train accident and this passage from first will and testament	may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he	first saw it- if he did:   lord love us look at all the	disconnected limbs floating hereabouts like bloody feathers at that-	and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the	tongue are in all the cheek h	0.30166232349522504
4639. let us see just how typical krim is	168.9156143263344
4640. he is new york-born	and jewish	65.37578383207544
4641. he spent one year at the university of north carolina	because thomas wolfe went there	1098.1104542600774
4642. he returned to new york to work	for the new yorker to edit a western pulp to duck the war	in the owi to write publicity for paramount pictures and	commentary for a newsreel then he began his career as critic for various	magazines	6797.13734589893
4643. now he has abandoned all that to be a writer	373.4485752338561
4644. i do	not want to quibble about typicality; in a certain sense one manner	of experience will be typical of any given group while another will	not	4273.310694155416
4645. but i've got news for krim: he's not typical he's pretty special	643.1807134074519
4646. his may typify a certain kind of postwar new york experience	but his experience is certainly not typical of his generation's	3039.4608853585837
4647. in any case who ever thought that new york is typical of anything	782.0040386889254
4648. men of krim's age aspirations and level of sophistication	were typically involved in politics before the war	2111.2902952273635
4649. they did	not duck the war but they fought in it however reluctantly;	they sweated out some kind of formal education; they read widely and	eclectically;	they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous	magazines but they did whatever nasty thing they could get	in order to eat; they found out who they were and what they could do	then within the limits of their talent they did it	0.20124717349522497
4650. they did not worry	about experience because experience thrust itself upon them	956.4117494754304
4651. and they traveled out of new york	93.0198153815475
4652. only a native new yorker could	believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center	2361.8292134647886
4653. it	is a publishing and public relations center but these very facts prevent	it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism	and untruth	2626.839224201055
4654. krim's typicality consists only in his new yorker's	view that new york is the world; he displays what outlanders	call the new york mind a state that the subject is necessarily unable	to perceive in himself	5795.780197643406
4655. the new york mind is two parts abstraction	and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact	the world	2339.465143012443
4656. in his fulminating against the literary world krim is	really struggling with the new yorker in himself but it's a losing	battle	3286.2278596942865
4657. closely related to his illusions about his typicality	is krim's complicated feeling about his jewishness	1102.476567389585
4658. he writes	most of my friends and i were jewish; we were also literary;	the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility	needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and	incredible intellectual-literary ambition i have ever seen or could ever	have imagined	7322.950908747273
4659. within themselves just as people my friends were	often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this	unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed; their reading and thinking	gave	an extension to their normal blushes about appearing 'jewish'	in subway bus racetrack movie house any of the public places that	used to make the jew of my generation self-conscious	walking across seventh avenue without their glasses on willing to	dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature	h	0.20124717349522497
4660. at other points in his	narrative krim associates jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition	with abstraction with his personal turning aside from the good	the true and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of james t	farrell to the international the false and the inflated	6926.620432567381
4661. krim says in short that he is a suffering jew	373.4728492343218
4662. the only possible	answer to that is i am a suffering franco-irishman	956.6807612195589
4663. we all love	to suffer but some of us love to suffer more than others	1097.7120544367237
4664. had krim	gone	farther from new york than chapel hill he might have discovered	that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version	of the jews' lot remotely recognizable	5305.430853864744
4665. more important is the	simple human point that all men suffer and that it is a kind of	anthropological-religious	pride on the part of the jew to believe that his suffering	is more poignant than mine or anyone else's	4120.413302639938
4666. this is not to	deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos but only to assert that these	horrors	have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience	them that among the various side effects is the local hysteria	of jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion which	they call oppression and pain	8071.143391449834
4667. in their stupidity and arrogance they	believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms	and ghettos	1877.2916023171674
4668. some of us have imagination and sensibility too	250.27992149721325
4669. finally there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest american	fiction is being written by jews but it is not jewish fiction;	saul bellow and bernard malamud through intellectual toughness	perception through experience in fact have obviously liberated	themselves from any sentimental krim self-indulgence they might have	been tempted to	5063.150586934938
4670. krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and	the publishing apparatus of american literary culture in our day	2361.597698279364
4671. krim was able to get an advance for a novel and time and opportunity	to write at yaddo but it was no good	2313.5978226474685
4672. i had natural sock he	says 'as a storyteller and was precociously good at description dialogue	and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade	but i was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that	prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained	fiction-writing	7622.001915879846
4673. and again how can you write when you haven't	yet read 'bartleby the scrivener'	946.6485462375618
4674. krim came to believe	that the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning	1660.2936443228214
4675. his	articulate jewish friends convinced him that education	was a must	502.7046923579969
4676. he moved in a highly intellectual	group in greenwich village in the late forties becoming internationalized	overnight	2117.9984037702043
4677. then followed a period in which he wrote reviews	for the new york times book review the commonweal commentary	had a small piece in partisan review and moved on	to hudson the village voice and exodus	3874.9851738466764
4678. the work for	commonweal	was more satisfying than work for commentary because	of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo	3059.3819519174695
4679. commentary	was a mere suburb of partisan review the arch-enemy	376.5085851450932
4680. both	magazines were rigid with reactionary what-will-t s eliot-or-martin	buber-think	565.1549262395584
4681. fear h	0.20041515
4682. partisan has failed	krim says for being snob-clannish overcerebral europeanish aristocratically	alienated from the us	1648.2043991297312
4683. it was the creation	of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize	literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with	its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in spenglerian inclusiveness	h	4037.7705169709443
4684. kenyon sewanee and hudson operated in an anglo-protestant	new critical chill; their example caused krim	and his friends to put on englishy airs affect all sorts of	impressive	scholarship and social-register unnaturalness h in order to	slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages	7029.055826667284
4685. qui	s'excuse s'accuse as the french jewish intellectuals used	to say	505.60548865361
4686. through all this raving krim is performing a traditional	and by now boring rite the attack on intelligence upon the largely	successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate american	writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn	6473.895363734423
4687. god	knows that partisan and the rest often were and remain guilty	of intellectual flatulence	1091.3837844864045
4688. sociological jargon germano-slavic	approximations to english third-rate but modish fiction and outrages	to common sense have often disfigured partisan and in lesser degree	the other magazines on the list	4660.264867567956
4689. what krim ignores in his contempt	for history and for accuracy is that these magazines partisan	foremost brought about a genuine revolution in the american mind	from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950	3462.176534041828
4690. the most obvious characteristic	of contemporary american writing apart from the beat nonsense	is its cosmopolitanism	1882.830914791577
4691. the process of cosmopolitanism	had begun in earnest about 1912 but the first war and the depression	virtually stalled that process in its tracks	2455.3224097892357
4692. without the good magazines	without their book reviews their hospitality to european writers	without above all their awareness of literary standards we might	very well have had a generation of krim's heroes- wolfes farrells	dreisers and i might add sandburgs and frosts and macleishes	in verse- and then where would we be	7588.396907638804
4693. screwed stewed and tattooed	as krim might say after reading a book about sailors	953.0092047309021
4694. when	partisan and kenyon set up shop mencken was still accepted	as an arbiter of taste george jean nathan	and alexander woollcott were honored in odd quarters and the whole	booth tarkington willa catheter pearl buck amy	lowell william lyon phelps atmosphere lay thick as los angeles	smog over the country	7518.9233237573335
4695. politics economics sociology- the	entire area of life that lies between literature and what krim calls	experience- urgently needed to be dug into	2314.1441717633224
4696. the universities	certainly were not doing it nor were the popular magazines of the day	1632.91222798457
4697. this partisan above all did; if it had never printed a word	of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would	still be historic	2466.9200489701047
4698. but it did print good verse and good fiction	392.2238213270158
4699. if	the editors sometimes dozed and printed pretentious new york-mind	dross they also printed malraux silone chiaromonte gide bellow	robert lowell francis fergusson mary mccarthy delmore	schwartz mailer elizabeth hardwick eleanor clark and a host	of other good writers	4142.076851963482
4700. partisan review and the other literary magazines	helped to educate in the best sense an entire generation	2124.0472177547854
4701. that	these magazines also deluded the krims of the world is unfortunate	but inevitable	946.1315297301259
4702. it is a fact of life that magazines are edited by	groups: they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all	3447.660302407026
4703. and	it is also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated	people around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like	a literary movement	3327.8856478680764
4704. only writers doing their work	22.419515695544803
4705. literary movements are the creation of	when krim says mine was as severe a	critical-intellectual environment as can be imagined he is off his	rocker	2605.8145405284045
4706. he indicates that he has none of the disciplines that criticism	requires including education; the result was his inevitable bedazzlement	through ignorance	3264.551366740657
4707. he wasn't being educated in those village	bull-sessions as he claims	499.04664011592104
4708. no one was ever educated through bull-sessions	in anything other than to quote him again perfumed bullshit	2104.177801924502
4709. only a new york hick would expect to find the literary	life in greenwich village at any point later than walt whitman's	day	2315.0791484939887
4710. the highly intellectual h minds that krim says he encountered	in the village did their work in spite of not because of any	village atmosphere	3885.639946400953
4711. but krim's complaint is important because not	only in new york but in other cities and in universities throughout	this country young and not so young men at this moment are being	bedazzled by half-digested ideas	3858.531054000414
4712. those who have quality will outgrow	the experience; the rest will turn beat or into dentists or into	beat dentists	2829.8220884015473
4713. for the sad truth is that while one might write	well without having read bartleby the scrivener one is more	likely to write well if one has read it and much else	3439.4129213034307
4714. the most appalling	aspect of krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic	1405.154632295644
4715. he mentions the beats only once when he refers to their having revived	through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit	death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression	and actual experience h but the entire narrative is written	in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause and in the	sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant our mother tongue	5884.957619582319
4716. krim's	aesthetic combines anti-intellectualism conscious and unconscious	nai^vete and a winsome reliance upon the natural and upon experience	2369.398566229222
4717. ideas are the thruway to nowhere	43.287721686946085
4718. my touchstones	h had been strictly literature and humanly enough american	literature	957.4129077134864
4719. he alludes	to something called direct writing and he finds that criticism	gets in the way of his truer realer imaginative bounce	2177.6025095379237
4720. there had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and	defacing of the bust of lauro di bosis near the villa lante and in	the gianicolo	4469.410131771006
4721. something was happening all right slowly it	is true but you could feel it	943.1856403541208
4722. an italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around	the area of quirinal palace the first time since the war	2824.2423663194495
4723. at least	they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated flat	dialect mispronunciation of mussolini's home district- dogumenti	per favore	2460.7534429365696
4724. but who knew that might be coming one of these days	753.1834647773796
4725. there were other italians who still bore scars they had earned	in police station basements resisting	1251.5750636233347
4726. they laughed and true to national	form and manners never talked long or solemnly on any subject	at	all but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts	4998.674510102257
4727. we saw giuseppe berto at a party once in a while tall lean	nervous and handsome and in our opinion the best novelist of them	all except pavese and pavese is dead	3456.14894516715
4728. berto's the sky is	red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book	to come out of the war	3701.979988149137
4729. now he was married to a beautiful girl had	a small son and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the	movies	2328.430513357979
4730. on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of	the count of monte cristo	1877.981492887367
4731. on his bookshelves were some of	the latest american novels including bellow's seize the day	but he hadn't read them and	wasn't especially interested in what the american writers were up	to	3420.2135031499683
4732. he was interested in robert musil's the man without qualities	556.4829064420283

4734. he was interested in italo	svevo	65.63217192565611
4735. he was thinking his way into a new novel a big one one that	people had been waiting for	1735.403502188507
4736. it was going to be hard going all the	way because he hadn't written seriously for a while except for a few	stories was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully	used in the sky is red	6425.434598641751
4737. this one was going to be different	92.9890506292194
4738. he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast	of the hard country of calabria that he knew so well	3471.3443114827
4739. he was going	to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all leave rome	and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life go back to calabria	3218.740948683556
4740. he knew all about it and had put	it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful	book not for some strange reason published in the us	5164.964211720652
4741. he	knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor	southern peasant boy	1570.0761674092842
4742. he knew all about the infection and the fever	and too the moment of realization when he saw for himself threw up	his hands and quit ended the war as a prisoner in texas	5497.227569487365
4743. berto knew	all about fascism	14.847632269511417
4744. so did his friend the young novelist rimanelli	251.6654230798788
4745. rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous says what he	thinks	502.8239166663331
4746. he had put it down in a war novel the day of the lion	1412.4062937228039
4747. these people were not talking much about it but you a foreigner	sensed their apprehension and disappointment	1417.3227381195475
4748. so there we were	talking around and about it	391.6906545257076
4749. the english lady said she had to go	to vienna for a while	790.8555238970911
4750. it was a pity because she had planned to lay	a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue towering over rome in	spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo	5003.985534198839
4751. around	that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos	and there is a glowing view of the whole city in that park are the	rows of marble busts of garibaldi's fallen men the ones who one	day rushed out of the porta san pancrazio and under fire all the way	up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground	of the villa doria pamphili	0.20124717349522497
4752. when they lost it the french artillery	moved in and that was the end for garibaldi that time on 30	april 1849	3242.4414365894677
4753. once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow	lane	793.5617822369487
4754. we had walked it many times and shivered figuring what a	fish barrel it had been for the french	2603.3468547614348
4755. now the park is filled with	marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and	proper names of the men who fell	2846.2815640514737
4756. we were at a party once and	heard an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious	2118.5266702612894
4757. our companion was a huge plain-spoken american sculptor who had	been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across france in 1944	1720.5930732921067
4758. he said	it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that no	matter who gave the order and what for	3681.908771046411
4759. oh it would be butchery	all right	the european said	373.6395894468975
4760. we would see it that way but	it was glorious then	742.3971568609895
4761. it was the last time in history anybody could	do something gloriously like that	942.2503283657883
4762. i thought: who is	older now	65.6216452471837
4763. old world and new world	14.83988713358833
4764. the sculptor looked at	him bugeyed and amazed angry	391.05972225246234
4765. he had made an assault once with 180	men	260.65068457602234
4766. it was a picked assault company	65.0949304482538
4767. they went up against an ss	unit of comparable size over a little rise of ground over an open	field	1887.3612948026275
4768. they made it killed every last	one of the krauts took the village on schedule	1651.058801404383
4769. when it was over	eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded	1250.1681741141806
4770. the	whole thing from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks	spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight	rise of ground and then jumped off took maybe between twenty and	thirty minutes	6320.875507975784
4771. the sculptor looked at him let the color drain out	of his face grinned and looked down into his drink a bad martini	made with raw italian gin	2987.537803836002
4772. excuse me the european said	22.068343518428506
4773. i am not familiar with	the expression	94.34707561274618
4774. the apartment where we were talking that afternoon	in march faced onto the street garibaldi's men had charged	up and along	3053.838482004042
4775. across the way from the apartment building is a ruined	house shot to hell that day in 1849 and left that way as a memorial	2605.6348654442004
4776. there is a bronze wreath on the wall	251.02586963952345
4777. like everything else in rome	ruins and monuments alike that house is lived in	940.169763932396
4778. i have seen diapers	strung across the ruined roof	391.3918851007576
4779. the english lady really	wanted to put a wreath on the garibaldi monument on the 30th of april	1571.1165752986806
4780. she had her reasons for this	64.76717511619516
4781. for one thing there wasn't going	to be any ceremony at all this year	930.969839299986
4782. there were a few reasons for that	too: garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the communists	nowadays	2570.556898207756
4783. therefore the government wanted no part of him	166.81776721651107
4784. sort of as if our government should decide to disown washington or lincoln	and then there were ecclesiastical matters	the matter of garibaldi's anti-clericalism	3686.422687090915
4785. there was a new pope	and the vatican was making itself heard and felt these days	1254.7026900982787
4786. as	it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself but of more	liberal political persuasion	2125.113528744439
4787. nothing was going to be done this year	to celebrate garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of rome	1407.9986352509775
4788. all	that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument	and lay a wreath at its base	3259.062884227408
4789. this would show that somebody even a foreigner	living in rome cared	643.8608332386259
4790. and then there were other things	64.80402734679419
4791. some	of the marble busts in the park are of young englishmen who fought	and died for garibaldi	1565.444844131844
4792. she also mentioned leaving a little bunch	of flowers at the bust of lauro di bosis	1870.5006998650551
4793. it is hard for me	to know how i feel about lauro di bosis	937.2394838566212
4794. i suffer from mixed feelings	22.230836525939075
4795. he was a well-to-do handsome and sensitive young poet	265.32940318747876
4796. his bust	shows an intense mustached fine-featured face	250.88972834949132
4797. he flew over rome	one day during the early days of mussolini and scattered leaflets over	the city denouncing the fascists	2043.2285019851538
4798. he was never heard of again	64.76185294088108
4799. he is thought either to have been killed by the fascists as soon as	he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing	his plane	3210.2829550600973
4800. he was thus an early and spectacular victim	252.17418804846685
4801. and there	is something so wonderfully romantic about it all	374.27308298449077
4802. he really didn't	know how to fly	140.10633777000828
4803. he had crashed on take off once before	166.85058060677272
4804. gossip had	it that a famous american dancer	of the time had paid for both the planes	2125.064449709564
4805. it was absurd and dramatic	15.00557740365942
4806. it is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a	square in the city which was renamed piazzo lauro di bosis after the	war	4667.067043484984
4807. most romans even some postmen know it by the old name	506.2428790918892
4808. faced with a gesture like di bosis' i find usually that my	sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend	3014.209031806821
4809. the things that	happened in police station basements were dirty grubby and most often	anonymous	1090.669237818896
4810. no poetry no airplanes no dancers	65.30431897006677
4811. that is how the real	routine of resistance goes on and its strength is directly proportionate	to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be	taken to pieces piece by piece without quitting	3744.2173302863944
4812. it is an ugly business	and there are few if any wreaths for them	1405.686292462336
4813. i keep thinking	of a young woman i knew during the occupation in austria	940.0653205665542
4814. she had been picked up by the russians questioned in	connection with some pamphlets sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage	2812.7008182473087
4815. she escaped crawled through the usual mine fields under barbed	wire was shot at swam a river and we finally picked her up in linz	2585.640980896316
4816. she showed us what had happened to her	248.7541938181001
4817. no airplanes no nathan	hale statements	43.629856025694075
4818. just no spot not even a dimesize spot on her whole	body that wasn't bruised bruise on top of bruise from beatings	3254.1999803400604
4819. i understand very well about lauro di bosis and how his action	is symbolic	940.8697438864485
4820. the trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem	a very realistic one	1422.0404067648615
4821. the english lady wanted to pay tribute	to garibaldi and to lauro di bosis but she wasn't going to be here	to do it	2447.8739245696916
4822. were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for	her by proxy so to speak	2568.9352281668994
4823. there was a pretty thorough silence at	that point	260.8795152522074
4824. my spoon stirring coffee banging against the side of the	cup sounded as loud as a bell	2134.022649755685
4825. i thought: what the hell	14.957530959873967
4826. why	not	0.30041514999999996
4827. i said i would do it for her	167.01933205589373
4828. i had some reasons too	22.19361005564398
4829. i admire the english lady	14.814276508949693
4830. i hate embarrassing silences and have	been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one	2583.28273610142
4831. i also	had and have feelings about garibaldi	166.84117163624833
4832. like every southerner i can't	escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats forlorn lost causes	1646.3263385398946
4833. though garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to pickett's	charge- which like all southerners i view in almost miltonic	terms fallen angels etc- i associated the two	2850.204750720994
4834. and to top	it all i am often sentimental on purpose trying to prove to myself	that i am not afraid of sentiment	3452.5157288506525
4835. so much for all that	14.706252681018956
4836. the english lady was pleased and enthusiastic	140.6217231813951
4837. she gave me the names	of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even	march up to the monument with me	2730.95082485856

4906. this help is offered to applicants who ordinarily	would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or	circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds	from commercial sources on reasonable terms	5619.229356935803
4907. each applicant is required	to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored	1257.5093606646838
4908. the government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up	to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses	3475.3388714878056
4909. the applicant pays the rest of the cost but his own time spent on the	work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied	toward his share of the cost	3743.216080020019

4913. the royalty applies to	both principal and interest but it never exceeds 5 percent	943.8067744650101
4914. information application forms and assistance in filing may be	obtained from the office of minerals exploration us department	of the interior washington 25 dc or from the appropriate	regional office listed below:	in most of the less developed countries however such programing	is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent	7430.530229020807
4915. only a very few of	the more advanced ones such as india and pakistan have developed	systematic techniques of programing	1872.297714881503
4916. others have so-called development	plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects	collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals	without analysis of the actions required to attain them	5605.383614511333
4917. only rarely	we	neither growth nor a development	program can be imposed on a country; it must express the nation's	own will and goal	2469.954711781895
4918. nevertheless we can administer an aid program	in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing	2588.059041163803
4919. first we can encourage responsibility by establishing	as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the	definition of objectives and the assessment of costs	2738.9254353295305
4920. second	we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on	the consistency of such projects with the program	2354.508429499404
4921. third	we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development	which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources	2172.0697623304613
4922. this	includes assistance in- h assembling the basic economic financial	technological and educational information on which programing depends;	h surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad	sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication	industry and power; h designing the financial mechanisms of the	economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation; and h	administrative practices which will make possible the more effective	we must use	the application of conditions	in the allocation	of aid funds cannot of course be mechanical	0.30166232349522504
4923. it must	be recognized that countries at different stages of development have	very different capabilities of meeting such conditions	1713.4622982113967
4924. to insist	on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond	the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration	of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage	more rapid growth	5932.448019560718
4925. in the more primitive areas where the capacity	to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities	may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them	before a well worked out program is available	4108.284988698911
4926. thus we might provide	limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport	communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of	acceptable country programs	3691.3202673209184
4927. in such a case however we would encourage	the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply	it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and	make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance	to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress	being made	5130.2683417293665
4928. at the other end of the spectrum where the	more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through	decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program we should	be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval	as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support	in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential	foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program	0.30166232349522504
4929. a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing	is one important kind of self-help	935.1839672503484
4930. it is vitally	important that the new us aid program should encourage all	of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less	developed countries themselves	4642.8939442165365
4931. external aid can only be marginal	although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive	1888.866235242916
4932. external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help	1184.0335773621377
4933. us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to	provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves	can take	2182.782240488211
4934. in establishing	conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries	to remake themselves in our image	2562.8439290205197
4935. open societies can take many forms	and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their	own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals	3217.457008058106
4936. on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point	out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories	without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel	to staff them	6148.109423616812
4937. once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned	with a country's development potential we can be blunt in suggesting	the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur	3434.6368003358307
4938. the major areas of self-help	are the following:	this includes not only development programing but also establishing	tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment;	fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation;	and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial	resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury	the reduction of dependence on external	sources	8323.94060297734
4939. with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting	realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports	1877.730418734684
4940. it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate	tapping the energies of	for both economic and political reasons	all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth	of a country	5900.880824875672
4941. otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability	165.92193481876632
4942. in many societies what we	regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted	as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part	of	routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination	will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted	but unfriendly	7550.654439526208
4943. yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources	if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread	1570.4501739544403
4944. moreover	tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion	of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-american	sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest	5302.684222638875
4945. some	of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support	can be traced to the identification- correct or not- of communist	regimes with personal honesty and pro-western regimes with corruption	3455.505793002444
4946. a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically	uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential	in the long run	3471.2661485176163
4947. the united	states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with	aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries	making serious efforts in self-help	3443.668766305736
4948. in many instances it	can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such	efforts	2581.527115726515
4949. there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy	we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups	in government which would like to press forward with economic and social	reform measures to promote growth	4032.417172416236
4950. but there will be still other countries where despite	the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political	or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance	4980.924573821854
4951. even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that	our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to	termination	2449.987825827398
4952. development	the most fundamental concept of	the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our	resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and	social development of the less developed countries	6044.248414060753
4953. this is not a short-run	goal	43.631478887677574
4954. to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view	it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years	and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same	fashion	6042.775744559306
4955. how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort	will vary greatly from country to country	1733.4058538695967
4956. in several significant cases	such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these	countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic	and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance	5944.361507335538
4957. these cases in which light is already visible at the other	end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb	gradually others will move up to	the number of countries thus favorably situated is	small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the	underdeveloped world	5145.432716226281
4958. meantime over the decade of the sixties we	can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big	push into self-sustaining growth	3703.1316457390653
4959. in still others which are barely on	the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring	significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their	human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded	aid is a long-term	process stretching	over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social	and economic conditions in the less developed world	5774.529352565851
4960. it must be recognized	as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military	crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba	3695.483450001272
4961. the specific reasons for a long-term approach the need to	many of the individual projects for	which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy	periods	2847.7789491199915
4962. dams river development schemes transportation networks	educational systems require years to construct	956.6341143181289
4963. moreover on complex	projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery	and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence	2475.0130787741004
4964. thus as a development program is being launched commitments and	obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by	twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year	5463.370543091527
4965. the	capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting	the need	to plan investment programs	1253.5133343277334
4966. several of	the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through	experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for	at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than	that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities	involved are all to take place in the proper sequence	7997.576692764058
4967. without such	forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities	are completed before there is power to operate them or before	there is transport to service them; or a skilled labor force is trained	before there are plants available in which they can be employed	4678.606178049564
4968. most important	of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary	steps to allocate and commit their own resources	3474.69576936628
4969. they must	be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory	policies	946.2643391334857
4970. they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help	measures which are described in the preceding section	2351.4994590992424
4971. the taking	of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions	377.43230058300304
4972. moreover	once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves	felt	1403.4688373710012
4973. they must therefore be related to long-range development	plans	261.1349866544473
4974. if the less developed countries	are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the united states	as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give	long-term commitments	4994.597815711957
4975. in this as in so many aspects of our development	assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take	are the most important ones	2584.9223089254165
4976. the extent to which we can persuade	the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets	toward which they should be working to establish in the light	of this forward	perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate	attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves	all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly	on the incentives we place before them	0.30166232349522504
4977. if they feel that we are taking	a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into	reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities	they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required	4192.887510334616
4978. perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear	evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we	have responded with long-term commitments	4443.114426085381
4979. you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost	50 years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and	the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs	come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation	that mankind has ever known	5272.275095219988
4980. then i have seen the pride of country	well in the eyes of these young people	1894.276147545889
4981. so i say mr speaker	god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body	but for the united states of america and the free world	3249.325139668576
4982. you remember	the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone	asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and	vice president johnson was in asia who is running the	store	6197.661106813359
4983. and he said the same fellow who has been running it sam	rayburn	784.3631621833784
4984. mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire	to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record;	and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend	their remarks	6164.108309282923
4985. is there objection	to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts	506.5204944049242
4986. there was	no objection	4.43403298866251
4987. it is notably significant that so many members	from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for	our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn	2859.857617166158
4988. i purposely	refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from	the state of texas	2362.4893962513283
4989. i did so because i agree with so many here	today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united	states	2602.013506335979
4990. for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative	branch of our government- it is a privilege for us to do honor	to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all	the people of our country	6564.980865966031
4991. to honor him is to honor ourselves	93.25044294313835
4992. in this my first year as a member of this body i have experienced	many memorable moments	2124.872888758881
4993. many of these experiences are so important	that they will be cherished forever by me	1085.3307916755844
4994. and like many of you here	present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting	with the honorable speaker of the house	4293.113220783956
4995. at that time he afforded	me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need	to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national	and local topics and any problems that i may have been vexed with	at the time	4726.829535533712
4996. he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me	and tremendously wise in his counsel	2104.834761491465
4997. in conclusion he wished me well-	and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express	himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children	2985.6366898858446
4998. in	my short period here i believe that at no time has he been otherwise	than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle	4077.036808455364
4999. he is most effective	in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative	accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion- even	at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle-	and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted	by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a	noble partisan	5699.1131750351
5000. i am highly privileged today to commemorate the	brilliant career of this parliamentary giant	1420.4542222387731
5001. he will ever be my example	as a true statesman; one who is thoroughly human who affects	no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and	sterling honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the	country he has loved and served so long	4839.931241812103
5002. may the divine speaker in	heaven bless this country with sam rayburn's continued service	here for years to come	2596.189268303652
5003. it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for	me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues	in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam	rayburn	3745.326311515347
5004. in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the	stabilizing force that he represents in current american government	is an almost indispensable source of strength	4106.7436638700765
5005. he has become in this	half century the grand old man of american history	937.2323700922467
5006. it seems to me	that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition	to providence that sam rayburn's vigor and his life remain	undiminished through the coming decades	5333.26531795641
5007. here briefly in this	humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation	that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country	2855.793999796064
5008. but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress	in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam	rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman	and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this	nation	7386.817084482069
5009. it happens that i am a legislator from ohio and that i feel	deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district	and my state	2871.2628803853418
5010. what sam rayburn's life proves to us all is	the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and	with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests	of one's own community one's own district one's own state	and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of	the problems of this the greatest nation of all time	8340.988346878314
5011. for sam	rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never	forgot texas	940.0274294771807
5012. in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as	legislators to our community our district our state	3036.499773447813
5013. and if we	follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual	political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature	of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected	in the devotion of our services to our country	4816.808953275813
5014. for what sam	rayburn's life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character	are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your	country and neglecting your district	5309.340032309459
5015. there is no such thing as being	diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs	1258.4944828903433
5016. the	two are as one	22.522375856586947
5017. this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes	close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburn's career up to	this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political	life under our processes of government	4207.974851691583
5018. more than that	sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity	so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count	some of his best friends in the opposition	5656.617664784155
5019. through the most rancorous	battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national	and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example	of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility	3232.955328233532
5020. sam rayburn	has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and	ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political	manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions	5909.397650090687
5021. this means much to	the american tradition	93.77073675502072
5022. it is an answer in its way individual and	highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily	vicious in its campaign characteristics	3885.6274328126456
5023. and the name rayburn	is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for	the last half century	2031.903182530193
5024. it is i insist hard to define the	rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is	so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes	so deep	5002.185707569358

5032. i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and	great american not only because today he establishes a record of	having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than	twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has	made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half	century of service as a member of congress	8831.743268442031
5033. speaker rayburn	has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction	of the house in the speaker's chair	1885.762699063865
5034. he had an outstanding record	as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in 1913	the 63d congress	3276.763165652792

5037. but to run the gauntlet of the programs	sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts	would fill the pages of today's record	2471.279422358471
5038. no greater pleasure	has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present	today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great	legislator this great texan this great american	5887.347545748731

5044. no one could be more devoted than he to the	american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical	significance in the political history of the world and i shall never	forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon	the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative	government and their importance in the context of today's	assault upon popular government	0.30166232349522504
5045. above all he is a person to	whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional	problems which inevitably confront a new congressman	2750.7287433484616
5046. in	this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic	and most helpful	1638.85944788985
5047. on september 16 sam rayburn will have	served as speaker twice as long as any predecessor and i am proud	to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my esteem	for that notable american sam rayburn	4125.4128924857705
5048. the practice of state-owned	vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years	1877.858272395068
5049. at least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917	372.79322355520515
5050. the	state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately	200 in 1940	1399.5820212389058
5051. the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool	came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized	maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that	time	2854.8166090730283
5052. the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive	management including establishment of cost billing systems records	keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle	operation	4434.099011087195
5053. cars were operated in 1959 for an average 	78.86522896914343
5054. purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state	purchases	749.1737379221647
5055. unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to	the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state	sales or federal excise taxes	2867.995586051168
5056. assignment and	the legislature's role in policy determination concerning	state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to	appropriating funds for vehicles	3025.0088821162876
5057. the meaningful policies governing	the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have	been shaped by the state's administrative officers	2019.14234542463
5058. meaningful	policies include:	when cars should be traded the need and assignment of vehicles	use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances employees taking cars	home and need for liability insurance on state automobiles	5478.674869698412
5059. the state purchases	and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status	the purchase of compact	cars	the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible	unsuccessful efforts have been	it is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage	the state has recently undertaken	automobile practices	a survey of practices andor policies in other	states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals	several points for comparison with rhode island's practices	0.20124717349522497
5060. forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state	business	758.2884246461588
5061. two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative	approval	375.08161441109945
5062. states which provide automobiles for employees	assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool	2602.7415797370336
5063. twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition	allocation andor maintenance of state-owned vehicles	1090.9276518137606
5064. nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state	vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances	2109.9713685640586
5065. of these states the	average change-over point	is 13200 miles per year	639.4937975418143
5066. mileage	allowances for state employees are of two types: actual mileage	and fixed monthly allowances	1656.9669384641516
5067. actual mileage allowances	are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned	vehicles on state business at the rate of 	1332.0177657130585
5068. fixed	monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except	on a non-itemized basis	1411.4313809959833
5069. both allowances are governed by conditions and	restrictions set forth in detail in the state's travel regulations	1417.413418426197
5070. rhode island's reimburseable rate of 	10.779015740994966
5071. 07 per mile for	use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states'	rates	938.9468696237784
5072. the average of states' rates is 	30.30362357271042
5073. rhode island's rate of 	1.7150594670980337
5074. 07 per mile is considerably lower than	reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally	which approximate a 	1830.5984690280725
5075. actual mileage	allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state	642.1410889932725
5076. the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement	are controlled properly and not overly restrictive	1645.7045200109017
5077. fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject	94.41381710059636
5078. they have a great	advantage in ease of audit time and payment	959.7028733898105
5079. however they lend themselves	to abuse and inadequate control measures	373.61704231790907
5080. flat payments over	$50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of	state-owned vehicles	2354.357540427941
5081. travel allowances including	subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently	and compare favorably with other states' allowances	1567.7775569976286
5082. with few	exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses	and $15 per day subsistence	2140.531039329585
5083. travel allowances are well-regulated	and pose little problem in administration andor audit control	787.3459488608095
5084. of state automobile practices	it	is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles	for use of employees in rhode island	3890.1659464160934
5085. few records are available	concerning the subject prior to 1940	375.3692530063142
5086. those that are available	shed little light	140.94772148552553
5087. the registry of motor vehicles indicates that	at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917	1732.6649064337537
5088. it	should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles	is at least forty years old	2828.6116366596825
5089. the best reason that can be	advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded	highway construction during the 1920s and '30s	2605.7909814584427
5090. at that time highway	engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties	1407.7752635659685
5091. using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees	and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly	justifiable	2030.3286412267935
5092. once the principle was established the increase	in state-owned vehicles came rapidly	955.8155244722672
5093. and reasons other than employee	need contributed to the growth	373.92836758160036
5094. table 1 immediately below shows	the rate of growth of vehicles and employees	1178.6580742191545
5095. this rate of increase	does not signify anything in itself	372.72255156359574
5096. it does not indicate loose management	ineffective controls or poor policy	748.1945568730431
5097. but it does show that automobiles	have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same	proportion to the increase of state employees	2463.562831915492
5098. in the past twenty	years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied	from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now	3912.5455341852794
5099. whether there were too few automobiles	in 1940 or too many now is problematical	948.7775450011417
5100. the fact is simply	that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion	history and operation of the motor	pool	3032.901243095076
5101. subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management	of state automobiles can be related more clearly	1259.3160128645786
5102. prior to 1942	automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which	assigned	1408.223516799368
5103. this responsibility included all phases of management	93.25727386632103
5104. it	embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who	was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline	and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters	5749.922324651862
5105. in 1942 however the nation was at war	167.00596653903588
5106. gasoline and automobile tires	were rationed commodities	139.28219976037187
5107. the state was confronted with transportation	problems similar to those of the individual	783.0074924411682
5108. it met these problems	by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit	a centralized operation for the maintenance	and control of all state transportation	3897.4278406566964
5109. the motor pool then	as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located	throughout the state	1578.2243075162207
5110. it was organizationally the responsibility	of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund	basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation	4664.950755226932
5111. in 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created	department of administration an agency established as the	central staff and auxiliary department of the state government	2869.1117776318174
5112. the management	of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in	a recent report in the following manner:   under this new	management considerable progress appears to have been made	4812.81313341578
5113. the agencies	of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided	to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all	cars	2851.9022892895337
5114. whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained	losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing	system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping	the fund on a proper working basis	5645.2120693106435
5115. one indication of the merits of	the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956	while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% the	total maintenance cost increased only 11%	3856.1456967823897
5116. in order	to further refine the management of passenger vehicles on july 1 1958	the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by executive	order to the division of methods research and office services	5497.2279547048365
5117. the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility	for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles	2171.9672900932533
5118. this tied in closely with the	current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles	are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs	become excessive	4462.1227106797105
5119. moreover it allows the present management	to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly	distributed throughout the fleet; for example if one driver puts on	22000 miles per year and another driver 8000 miles per year their	cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30000 miles after two	years rather than 44000 miles	and 16000 miles respectively	5626.113852432823
5120. the motor pool is a completely	centralized and mechanized operation	563.3446427534566
5121. it handles all types of	vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities	than on extensive vehicle repairs	1717.3404724774318
5122. it contracts with outside	repair garages for much of the latter work	960.1882880564974
5123. where the pool excels is	in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses	1099.209250721086
5124. pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon	of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods	when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded	for sound economies	6456.681017416971
5125. from this motor pool personnel develop other	meaningful and related data	501.5709556848057
5126. in 1959-60 vehicles averaged an operating	cost of 	118.35131220076491
5127. based on this figure and considering depreciation	costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel	in excess of 10000 miles annually is more economical by state car	than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles	4009.106932530437
5128. they	estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data	of compact cars is compiled the break-even point may be reduced to	7500 miles of travel per year	4464.036830985133
5129. table 2 shows operating cost data of	state vehicles selected at random	641.7305887144737
5130. one matter of concern to	the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate	central garage facilities	2590.2219254525235
5131. present pool quarters at two locations in	providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient	operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of	such operational needs as stock and repair equipment	3737.0527276969106
5132. good facilities	would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle	costs even more	2127.178718260762
5133. the purchase of state-owned	vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases	of the state	1567.925248633575
5134. requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary	cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will	be made	3491.565667835931
5135. bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the	assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles	are made to the lowest responsible bidders	3107.9277657731805
5136. unit prices for state	vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public	1188.9088968245749
5137. the reasons	are obvious: it has no	federal excise or state sales tax to pay	1104.176213534704
5138. until 1958 the state was also	entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the	dealers	2123.037692213151
5139. in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state	motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies	but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier	3238.840438586293
5140. this is a normal	governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting	principles	961.1023622155802
5141. the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is	another matter to be covered in detail later	1401.6398862786777
5142. assignment and use policies	probably the most important of all matters	for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase	assignment use and management of state vehicles	4450.781283786863
5143. the legislature's	role in policy determination in this area for years has been	confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually	for the purchase and operation of vehicles	3204.695797516349
5144. the more meaningful policies	have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer	of the state- the director of administration	3266.913792289006
5145. there was a time some years ago when	local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their	own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as	well	3673.793098819669
5146. for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the	several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property	tax	4328.105872689201
5147. this tax was discontinued in 1936	43.619882224000044
5148. since that time	the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed	financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in	earlier years	4672.246502499242
5149. at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion	of municipal services as well	1250.5854799456642
5150. thus there has come into being	a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and	in addition must give assistance to its local governments	4651.023705123044
5151. this	financial assistance from the state has become necessary because	the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at	the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements	3248.3798343177305
5152. consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and	shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments	for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a	sales tax at the state level	5803.067867522428
5153. notwithstanding state aid the local	governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own	by strengthening the property tax	1890.617831884721
5154. this is being done both by the revaluation	of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property	hitherto neglected or ignored	3485.091961302494
5155. taxation of tangible movable	property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature	due possibly to several reasons: local assessors in the main	are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs the numerous	categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely	difficult and the inexperience of the majority of assessors	problems of taxing personal	property	5570.324945870407
5156. and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant:	situs fair and equitable assessment of value	2117.858119787485
5157. these	problems are not local to rhode island but are recognized as common	to all states	1245.981452976534
5158. although the laws of the various	states in general specify the situs of property ie residence	or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions	regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to	the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment	7119.8326040268585
5159. rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the	town in which it is situated	1574.0034543940124
5160. it also provides for the taxation of all	personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible	and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents	in this state	4829.916708241836
5161. in defining personal property it specifically mentions	all ships or vessels at home or abroad	1098.4569689602815
5162. intangible	property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater	portion of the year	2363.471792073598
5163. although a similar situs for tangible property	is mentioned in the statute this is cancelled out by the provision	that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property	situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated	4393.1972904933
5164. this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property	at its location on december 31	2584.608994146324
5165. both boats and aircraft would	fall within this category as well as motor vehicles	946.9842101492164
5166. the location	of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration	and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle	as being situated where it is garaged	5508.2990724098945
5167. obviously it would be impossible	to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of december	1571.4521632136143
5168. in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles	for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would	seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or	aircraft	5648.497664892021
5169. a recent example of this problem is the flying of six	airplanes on december 31 1960 from the newport airpark in middletown	to the north central airport in smithfield	3115.0682497485423
5170. this situation	resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably	966.7773673509653
5171. middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all	rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed	to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his	actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve months	next preceding the first day of april in each year	5464.035874269166
5172. the	smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision	of law h and all other tangible personal property situated or being	in any town in or upon any h place of storage h shall be taxed	to such person h in the town where said property is situated	7517.427153982622
5173. this problem of fair and equitable assessment	of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of	fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are	non-professional	and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach	to the problem	4374.448515979951
5174. this accounts for the wide variance in assessment	practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in	rhode island	2822.2824709786073
5175. this condition will undoubtedly continue until	such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established	or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method	of standard assessment practice to be adopted	3843.484933948979
5176. the rhode	island public expenditure council in its publication once commented:	the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would	be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing	all taxable property	5774.089623516426
5177. an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing	office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far	toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout	the state	3013.0013612897665
5178. a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences	and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different	and independent assessing units	3697.426526859997
5179. the institute of public	administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission	in 1959 recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects	of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally	organized and equipped for the job	4050.0641695370587
5180. the resulting setup it was	declared would be similar to that which is in successful operation	in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode	island	4629.375943930788
5181. to determine the practice	and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property	a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or	boards of assessors in rhode island	3101.3084378037875
5182. the replies from each	individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the	personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the	established policy of the town in each case	5626.611089873922
5183. there are legitimate reasons	for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among	the public officials in each town	2189.665076527542
5184. these opinions of the assessors	are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at	the present time	2807.5716685411835
5185. in reply to a question of whether they now	tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles	nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not	3083.5490774334785
5186. the wording	of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different	interpretations	1880.1141296832793
5187. one assessor checked boats only another trailers	and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred	to trailers without specifying the type	2325.9141941265802
5188. in two cases airplanes only	were indicated	139.64042703810412
5189. it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was	meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn	that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder	only certain types are valued for tax purposes	4219.959084988413
5190. boats were indicated	specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats	1652.009909737992
5191. it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed	as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound	to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property	3944.726709388318
5192. so few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess	movable property that the results are inconclusive	2367.613443764225
5193. only four towns indicated	that they made any more than a normal effort to list property	of this kind	1723.275105566577
5194. of greater interest is a question as to whether	movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership	2594.360217057935
5195. fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence	of the owner and nineteen did not answer	1709.9927196019555
5196. twenty-seven assessors	stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable	personal property and only five were opposed	3026.7795658775904
5197. seven others expressed	no opinion	14.953273608840712
5198. on this point there was fairly general agreement that	assessors would like to do more than they are doing now	2825.5469346851096
5199. it is not	clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or	only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal	property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns	3769.344956495027
5200. another question that was asked of the assessors was whether	they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or	at the residence of the owner	4265.125851444502
5201. eighteen voted for assessment by the	town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town	in which the owner resides	2455.2791903434318
5202. ten others made no reply	22.3801363950252
5203. of those who	have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred	940.9018169786798
5204. there	was one vote for location being the place where the property is	situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment	date	4125.976158782663
5205. to summarize it may be said that there is no one	prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation	of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement	and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location	is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge	5255.150253191916
5206. the need for	greater knowledge is evident from their replies	564.8728353558583
5207. property	interest has been shown for a number	of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats	1721.4743315353971
5208. assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation	upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility	to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified	amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting	7340.99954549252
5209. it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore	communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal	property which they have been unable to reach	3089.5867107461327
5210. through their	professional organization the rhode island tax officials association	the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed	3053.1930752774947
5211. no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the	difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence	on the part of the assessors	3452.5435379563773
5212. it has been estimated that	the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess	of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats	3679.9553793058885
5213. it is obvious that	this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors	of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be	subject to taxation	3340.3030841177447
5214. it is known that at least five towns	place some	value on some boats for tax purposes	2127.4322971129786
5215. however few are taxed and	the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on	the date of assessment of town valuations	2601.871149832679
5216. no one really knows	how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may	be	2117.163815623345
5217. slightly more than 5000 boats were registered with the coast guard	prior to the recent passage of the state boating law	2024.9406670987053
5218. only a few	more than 10000 boats had been registered with the division of harbors	and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had	been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought	the season to an early close	7231.858117200763
5219. the assessors' association	meeting at narragansett in september 1960 devoted its session to a	discussion of the boat problem	1728.316364662449
5220. local industry's investment in rhode island was the big story	in 1960's industrial development effort	1644.532399231289
5221. fifty-two companies started	or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling 1418000	square feet and representing an investment of $11900000; a	new post-world war 2 record	2739.42824158862
5222. with minor exceptions this expansion	was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or out-of-state	manufacturers already operating here	2818.0678827105653
5223. what made these new	location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960	was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation rhode	island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs	3950.1627254793907
5224. of the major expansions in 1960 three were financed under	the r i industrial building authority's 100% guaranteed	mortgage plan: collyer wire leesona corporation and american	tube + controls	3192.851309302119
5225. leading firms that arranged their own financing	included speidel corporation cornell-dubilier photek inc	division of textron narragansett gray iron foundry w r	cobb company and mays manufacturing company	2991.0478368118806
5226. expansion	and relocation of industry in rhode island is the direct responsibility	of the development council's industrial division and the figures	quoted above indicate a successful year's operation	4480.023535215651
5227. industrial	division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 rhode island	concerns during 1960 many of whom are still interested in a rhode	island location	2596.149339515824
5228. they are conscious of this state's new feeling	of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of	aids to	small business	although much of the industrial division's promotional	effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by	major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention	7399.954054477511
5229. our office of foreign and domestic commerce carries on a vigorous	program directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of	manufacturers in the lower employment categories	2862.7281218273793

5271. the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable	detail in the enabling act of the development council which	assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties	in the field of planning	3765.4866483617543
5272. two years ago the institute of	public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled	state-local relations in metropolitan rhode island	2833.2150815294144
5273. as	the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in	this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the planning	division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused	a reorientation of its work program	4212.906591942383
5274. these objectives are stated here	because of their importance in understanding the current activities	first priority will be given to	the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background	recognizing	the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration	that metropolian planning means or	should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account	the metropolitan nature of many of rhode island's problems	0.30166232349522504
5275. it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage	the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility	of local government	2592.276765134944
5276. to this end the community assistance program	of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function	to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning	assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their	the planning division will take the initiative	in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government;	among the operating departments of the state; between the cities	and towns of the state; and on a regional basis between the six new	on the basis that all citizens of the state	are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources	plans for the provision of essential services will	be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within	the state development budget	will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority	of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan	0.30166232349522504
5277. particular attention will	be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the	development of industry and recreation	1888.423476717174
5278. functionally the planning	division carries out four activities: long-range state planning	current state planning local planning assistance; and the preparation	of the state development budget	3887.633835853879
5279. the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive	state planning program in the nation	1428.4191495696934
5280. the long range aspects of	this program are divided into four distinct phases: basic mapping	inventory analysis and plan and policy formation	3259.7294395824924
5281. the work program	as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete	1098.53768876438
5282. recent	events- particularly the necessity of providing planning information	for the statewide origindestination study of the department	of public works- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated	4659.497683605426
5283. the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and	basic	since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning	program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the	long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps-	one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile and the second a series of 26 sheets	at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet covering the entire state	0.20124717349522497
5284. with	these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started	1184.2304590229955
5285. with the aid of matching federal funds available	under section 701 of the housing act of 1954 as amended the planning	division began a one year program july 1 1960 to complete the inventory	phase of the state planning program	4227.969536356324
5286. this phase consists of four	items: urban land use rural land use physical features and public	utility service areas	2585.0223243472237
5287. since the validity of all subsequent planning	depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care	is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible	3114.581766914059
5288. the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff	has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are	of significance to statewide planning	4633.009454489707
5289. the rural land use study is	being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island	and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use	3230.8409592256803
5290. the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types	of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to	public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and	like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion	july 1 1961	7018.184684171077
5291. the collection of information is meaningless	unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose	1257.8159382335757
5292. it is not within the scope of	this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in	rhode island	2801.75585264529
5293. however a word should be mentioned in regard to them	as independent units of government	1098.4795437864645
5294. there are forty-seven special	district governments in rhode island	districts four housing authorities and the kent county water		1477.0859990503527
5295. these forty-seven special purpose governments have the	authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued	and in general to exercise normal corporate powers	2999.0266174813414
5296. unlike cities	and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements	to the state bureau of audits	2806.0066368506605
5297. it is not an exaggeration to say	that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units	of government	2189.281360473649
5298. in addition to the collection of service charges	the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450000	2344.4964044876947
5299. a	review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent	to this report	1089.7553861813713
5300. included in the findings are:  forty-six	states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june	30	2117.4402902291704
5301. the other four states end on varying dates: alabama	new york and texas		433.86627179659956

5303. in eleven states	the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 while the state fiscal	year ends on june 30	hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington		2361.426802091185
5304. in eight states whose fiscal years close	on june 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december	31:		2192.508813235092
5305. one state alabama closes	its fiscal year on september 30 and all cities in the state with	one exception also close fiscal years on september 30	2748.3789607456156

5309. the remaining twelve states have varying	fiscal years for the state city and local governments	1096.0190237635113
5310. however	only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation	in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal	uniformity	3901.5156757132836
5311. an excellent summary of advantages concerning	the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained	in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently	2745.6219267969236
5312. he listed	among the values of fiscal uniformity:  the uniform fiscal	year requires compliance with common sense administration of local	finances: adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending	5157.346135838241
5313. the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another	common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks	are drawn	2173.4209767443217
5314. it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to	take advantage of cash discounts	1629.5792985867351
5315. the uniform fiscal year promotes	more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures	790.8473959887726
5316. by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set	on expenditures	1639.7703635836501
5317. the uniform fiscal year brings the town's	fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest	share of local disbursements	2453.636000827422
5318. this greatly simplifies the town's	bookkeeping and financial reporting	391.39660530456024
5319. the uniform fiscal	year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax	anticipation notes	1417.338085672191
5320. furthermore tax collections not immediately needed	for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes	augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax	levy	4097.957639797461
5321. the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison	of revenues and expenditures	500.66543666297696
5322. when towns have the same fiscal	year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons; and as the	cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also	increases	4828.524216507225
5323. towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare	259.5829764832769
5324. of all advantages probably none is more important than	the elimination of tax anticipation notes	1654.8002861171117
5325. borrowing in anticipation	of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority	of municipalities at all times	2029.321914146599
5326. it may be by bank loans sale	of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and	registration of warrants	3485.3411031334326
5327. in any event it is a form of borrowing which	could be and should be rendered unnecessary	1416.3555816235805
5328. its elimination would	result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates	are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always	available when needed most	5157.44755185319
5329. this type of borrowing can be reduced	to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted	and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year	3223.1553062843814
5330. any	approach	toward such a system looks toward saving and security	756.3040330555175
5331. it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons	for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform	fiscal year	2303.318065097876
5332. both the federal and state governments commence their	fiscal years on july 1	1192.1349447563994
5333. both units of government contribute increasingly	large sums of money to the several local governments in this	state as indicated below:    it has been said that when local	government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property	tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap; but with	the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization	and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important	functions this is no longer true	0.20124717349522497
5334. the haphazard fiscal year calendar	is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local	revenue and expenditure relationships	2825.319797329382
5335. although	there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal	years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered	2189.5681343807532
5336. these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal	uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle	2816.3534299587354
5337. one problem is a matter of shifting dates; the other is how to	finance the transition	1260.6458689848037
5338. little can be done about the changing	of dates	392.2372170422557
5339. this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars	259.3136685072351
5340. it	usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period	of time	1419.740054639635
5341. but cooperation and understanding between local officials	and the citizenry help lessen this problem	941.2336543038484
5342. the other problem	is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities	and towns	2135.8252747510164
5343. this will be covered more fully later	93.6267133677476
5344. it should be kept	in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can	convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial	condition of that town or city	5650.956112645458
5345. fortunately there are no cities or towns	in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too	difficult a position to finance the proposed change	2991.4664073326517
5346. sacrifice will	have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipality's advantage	to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than	pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely	5612.992527336834
5347. fiscal calendars	the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well	synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great	for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them	3229.648477623971
5348. the	type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent	of the adjustments needed	2129.530394006622
5349. two features are immediately evident	14.818609920222944
5350. first	the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single	formula	1402.249129580904
5351. second the shift to a uniform july 1-june 30 fiscal year	will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great	majority of cities and towns	2863.802843150427
5352. there are at least two problems to consider:	one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar; the other	is how to finance the adjustments when necessary	4302.0461034335995
5353. the latter matter	is considered in detail in a later section	500.64166738303646
5354. twelve cities and	towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a	uniform andor coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar	2815.5333996856107
5355. plans vary from	the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish	this end	938.8374926160911
5356. what is important here is that many of the cities and towns	recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the	initiative to obtain them	4291.994463206573
5357. an analysis of the fiscal-tax collection	year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition	may not be as painful as is commonly thought	2318.964997604689
5358. however it must be stressed	that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual	cities and towns involved	2590.1405240341355
5359. the adjustments needed to establish	a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout	rhode island based on a july 1-june 30 year are shown below	2732.8605499928335
5360. six cities and towns are presently on a	july 1-june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection	year with it	3268.853128443122
5361. no change is required for these towns	93.89059039364501
5362. these municipalities	include: barrington lincoln middletown newport north	kingstown and south kingstown	968.476899148072
5363. one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment	of their fiscal year only	1417.5826757141963
5364. this change will automatically adjust	their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments	due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year	4468.188389968487
5365. six cities and towns are now	on a july 1-june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their	tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity	2862.163967999053
5366. these cities and	towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central	falls and woonsocket	1184.1822217790482
5367. two cities	to be considered providence and cranston are an enigma	504.9040598835256
5368. both have	excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars	556.6415555004195
5369. however neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1-june	30 fiscal year	1105.2766793971784
5370. the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal	period could be accomplished relatively easy for them	1882.7381971201805
5371. in that	both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 they could levy taxes	for an interim period of nine months commencing with september	30 and ending with june 30	3345.608425980182
5372. these three installment dates would be:	october 26 january 26 and april 25 and november	15 february 16 and may 15	3046.044243726706
5373. both would start their new	fiscal year on july 1	374.62571200736704
5374. their tax collection calendar could then be:	july 25 october 26 january 26 and april 25;	and august 15 november 15 february 17 and may 15	4101.749387713648
5375. under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform	fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods	2327.5466133285854
5376. the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal	years which end prior to june 30	1178.8717196632606
5377. all of these towns will require	adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years	1101.8182460994108
5378. assuming	an adjustment to the july 1-june 30 fiscal year the required adjustment	of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table	3	4296.890999432484
5379. aside from the matter	of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing	the adjustment when this is necessary	2335.948982609182
5380. it should be emphasized	strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets	do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental	requirements	4085.1263552579258
5381. in many communities there is simply no financial	problem; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful	fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques	3118.8290548973177
5382. in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial	burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of	fiscal year changes	3042.059052749994
5383. fortunately such cases in rhode island are more	the exception than the rule	793.1971615893052
5384. as shown earlier in table 1	the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection	calendars	2595.4635882614066
5385. in addition no two rhode island communities are identical	in relation to their over-all financial condition	1257.0167031081528
5386. these factors	practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible; each	situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration	such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective	tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length	of the transition interval	7356.890051681346
5387. suitable plans range from those that are	very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require	borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds	3100.678222415034
5388. the financial problem where it exists usually stems from	the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period	2831.2237446416607
5389. for	those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments	there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone	or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the	problem	3672.522077032389
5390. governor	the theme of rhode island heritage week for 1961 will	be independence and union	1650.5163967107248
5391. it commemorates the 185th anniversary	of rhode island's independence when upon may 4 1776 the	general assembly by its action established the first free republic	in the new world	3109.394622017004
5392. as this year marks the centennial of the	beginning of the civil war this fact is being commemorated with several	exhibits throughout the state but most of all paying tribute to	the first rhode island volunteers who rushed to the defense of the	city of washington putting at the disposal of president lincoln	the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time	8565.273049686471
5393. on april 30 ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers	will take place at 1:00 pm at the dexter training grounds	in providence	2319.308928162338
5394. the independence day celebration will be properly	observed with a big military and civic parade from west warwick	to the greene homestead in anthony; and now therefore do i	john a notte jr governor of the state of rhode island and providence	plantations proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th 1961	as rhode island heritage week advising our citizens that throughout	this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open	to visitors as well as industrial plants craft shops museums and libraries	and i	earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities	to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding	week	0.30166232349522504
5395. in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand	and caused the seal of the state to be affixed this 21st day of april	in the year of our lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one	and on independence the one hundred and eighty-fifth	4526.549987069021

5397. national defense like the continuing search for peace with freedom	and justice for all is everybody's business	1412.834371230859
5398. our investment	in this effort the greatest in our nation's history reflects our	determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom	3481.245176399054
5399. it	is a sound investment	14.869748791688718
5400. as the president has said only when our	arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never	be employed	3471.5092436056307
5401. armed forces day is the annual report on	this investment a public presentation designed to give our own people	and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom	and justice the best possible opportunity to see and understand what	we have and why we have it	5018.6854090852985
5402. it is the purpose of armed forces	day to give americans an opportunity to honor men of the armed	forces those who have made the supreme sacrifice those who remain	to preserve our security	5464.351487896927
5403. freedom depends upon them; now therefore	do i john a notte jr governor of the state of rhode island	and providence plantations proclaim saturday may 20th 1961	as armed forces day reminding our citizens that we should rededicate	ourselves to our nation respecting the uniforms as the guardians	of our precious liberty	5095.8744425022915
5404. in testimony whereof i have	hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the state to be affixed	this 17th day of may in the year of our lord one thousand nine hundred	and sixty-one and of independence the one hundred and eighty-sixth	6778.067084996716
5405. governor	the president of the united states pursuant to a joint resolution	of congress has issued a proclamation each year since 1933	declaring may 22nd to be national maritime day	3221.4288949190823
5406. this date in	1819 marked the sailing of the s s savannah from savannah	georgia for liverpool	2137.049413509626
5407. this voyage was the first successful	crossing of the atlantic under steam propulsion	792.3794644415273
5408. the day is now appropriately	set aside to honor the american men and women who have contributed	to the success of our merchant marine fleet in peace and war	4652.292332485941
5409. the merchant marine is the fourth arm of defense for	a strong and effective american merchant marine is essential to	the economy and security of our nation	2872.9757967909113
5410. through trade and travel	across the seas the american merchant marine is carrying out its	historic mission of linking the united states of america with friendly	nations across the seas; and now therefore do i john a	notte jr governor of the state of rhode island and providence plantations	proclaim monday may 22nd 1961 as national maritime	day reminding our citizens that american merchant ships and american	seamen are ready at all times to serve our nation in the cause	of freedom and justice	0.30166232349522504
5411. in testimony whereof i have	hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the state to be affixed	this 20th day of april in the year of our lord one thousand nine	hundred and sixty-one and of independence the one hundred and eighty-fifth	4523.250892070015
5412. governor	governor	the miss rhode island pageant is sponsored by the	rhode island junior chamber of commerce as a part of the nation-wide	search for the typical american girl- a miss america from rhode	island	5659.381478049347

5414. the ideal girl-	possessed of talent poise intelligence personality and beauty	of face and figure- is chosen each year to represent rhode island	3486.315718909852
5415. many hours are given free by the jaycees to make this and all	local pageants outstanding events	1407.3139228473485
5416. proceeds realized from these pageants	are used by the jaycees to help support their various youth health	welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state	3899.4122784792476
5417. miss sally may saabye says that	within a short time- on june 17th- her reign will come to an	end	1880.9895708250333

5426. governor	jr governor	the ballet originated in italy about 1450	560.361528195604
5427. at	that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps	were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer	2318.878324744611
5428. ballet	flowered in italy during the next hundred years and about 1550	was carried to france when the italian princess catherine de medicis	married the king of france	4450.1948750595875
5429. the most famous ballet of that time	was called ballet comique de la reine	929.4184781408749
5430. dances alternated	with sung or spoken verses	141.72001859051767
5431. ballets were used in opera from its beginning	167.24370722264757
5432. they were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the intermissions	1419.9089276463624

5435. governor	as another thanksgiving draws near let us take time out from the often	hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled	the hearts of the pilgrims on the first thanksgiving	3848.443560040231
5436. the	pilgrims gathered to thank the lord for his benevolence during	their first year in the new land	2354.458636761329
5437. they had been through trying times	but their faith in the almighty had given them the courage and the strength	to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were	the price they had to pay for freedom	4135.247845758726
5438. and as the pilgrims bowed	their heads in humble gratitude they shared another feeling- the anticipation	of what the future held for them and their posterity	4063.7955711482814
5439. they	could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would	some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of	hope to the oppressed countries of the world	3865.7294908135627
5440. they simply turned to god	filled with gratitude and faith	559.8736686130128
5441. we who are living today may	learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first thanksgiving	day	1579.0969055145906
5442. the lord has shown time and time again his love for us	961.1719706692005
5443. we have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we	enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other	nations to realize with humble gratitude that god's providence has	been with us since the very beginning of our country	4603.096068808684
5444. and yet accompanying	our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial	time	1889.456673512895
5445. with world peace constantly being threatened most of us regard	the future skeptically and even with fear	1420.1228606451612

5543. the first	report in this continuing series appeared in the september 1960 issue	of the journal	1249.4105269158995
5544. another recent achievement was the successful development of a method	for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine	when the product is relatively non-volatile	4666.151909457508
5545. this work gave a heat	of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value	which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this	property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago	4045.773549519165
5546. similar measurements	are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the	heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride	3242.499699002327

5548. in one of these an exploding-wire	device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6000 f and	100 atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved	3698.0155120009013
5549. the accuracy of	measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during	a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison	with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2	percent	3941.618800689361
5550. this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals	750.4298736776498
5551. the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element	as a calorimeter	646.219334718815
5552. the element is inserted	in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire	and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy	4093.6966729645987
5553. this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and	the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the	element and the measured voltage across the element	3249.0125576418295
5554. a high-speed	shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation	of any portion of the electrical wire explosion	2803.9569720648506
5555. the shutter consists	of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part	789.9584198798772
5556. using	edgerton's method the fast-closing action is obtained from the	blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires	3272.422420799666
5557. the fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil	placed directly in front of the camera lens so that	no light may pass into the camera	3107.933485848328
5558. the opening action is obtained	when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through	the foil	2375.266639767375
5559. during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the	passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward	its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera	3662.4526219999643
5560. experiments	have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds	1412.7041921689167
5561. the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing	the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil	2329.77376608996
5562. besides	the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectra of	extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic	of other atoms ions and small molecules	4286.496425307145
5563. the detection and study	of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on	interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres	2168.2628297933556
5564. among the	most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light	diatomic hydrides oh and ch; somewhat less likely sources	are the heavier hydrides sh sih and sch	4802.052407953387
5565. very small	concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar	gas concentrations as low as f moleculesf may be sufficient	as compared to the f hydrogen atoms f required for detection of	the 21-cm line	3853.2053657929528
5566. high sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved	by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore only with	precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical	search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible	5636.113205328423
5567. to secure precise	measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical	microwave spectroscopy has been started	1581.0266534810876
5568. since conventional methods	are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions	the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead	3049.3847970681118
5569. this	involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor	which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave	range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity	3445.542455664002
5570. the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance	method was the oh radical	1408.731007714438
5571. results of this experiment include	the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which oh may	be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665	2722.171222912587
5572. 36 f with an uncertainty of 0	140.99861455932154
5573. success in observing these	spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory;	extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported	2192.2893596010144
5574. preparations	are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh	radicals	958.3686928600252
5575. the bureau is pursuing	an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration	services in the range 1	1883.4359307585175
5576. the efforts and accomplishments	fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based	upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving	principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium-4	vapor-pressure measurements	5621.727378888621
5577. an acoustical interferometer has been constructed and	used with helium gas as the thermometric fluid to measure temperatures	near 4	1890.2442193509178
5578. such an interferometer provides a means of absolute	temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to	the gas thermometer	3047.4663897692526
5579. when values of temperature derived with this instrument	were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid	helium-4 vapor pressures differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively	were found	3217.1486713522977
5580. this result is preliminary and work is continuing	252.6799771082198
5581. carbon resistors and impurity-doped	germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary	thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region	2019.9515950009475
5582. several	germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4	748.4713477362875
5583. 2 f and	their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 13 millidegree	when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer	whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium	3551.2371825009454
5584. preliminary	calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4	563.3693712866449
5585. 16	f at every 0	14.961351953654603
5586. the estimated standard deviations of the data for	two of the resistors were  1 millidegree; and for the third resistor	3	3040.820941426601
5587. the reproducibilities	of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated	in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath	from 4	1874.72071815329
5588. surface temperature gradients have been found to	exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter metallic storage	dewars	2590.4198634959457
5589. the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4	501.59934749021915
5590. 2	f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly	greater than the |l point	1886.213085039008
5591. a hydrostatic head correction has	been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures	or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium	2328.0012125184917
5592. however the surface	temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements	for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate	the tube	from the liquid helium surface	4462.500193496219
5593. it has also been observed in helium	2 that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures	and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer	2735.469514333108
5594. this	has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer	1186.2149027170176
5595. in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified	pressure transducer for pvt	precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on	corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer	3336.501625275233
5596. a prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and	thoroughly tested	752.4563516612329
5597. the transducer is a null-type instrument and employs	a stretched diaphragm 0	647.1860117476341
5598. 001 in thick and 1 in in diameter	250.20094280041204
5599. a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance	between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced	0	2049.940823119485
5600. spherical concave backing surfaces	support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent	the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit	3718.6654053961297
5601. over a temperature range from 25 to 200 f and at pressures up to	250 atm an overload of 300 psi applied for a period of one day	results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter	of mercury	4383.3834175387265
5602. a 6-year study of the	transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed	1644.6995093004402
5603. this project was carried out under sponsorship of the ballistic	missile division of the air research and development command us	air force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport	by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding	4297.352459450934
5604. a significant	effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl	numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation	region	3664.01691297231
5605. another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal	diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature	differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present	2856.182099163929
5606. the results of the study based on collision integrals computed from	the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air	will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity	thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures	of 1000 to 10000 f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from	f to f times normal density	8281.68221289609
5607. in march 1961 representatives of the national laboratories	of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr	united states and west germany met at the nbs	to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature	scale between 10 and 90 f	4307.798357956226
5608. as a first step toward this goal	arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through	circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers	for calibration by each national laboratory	5467.663196399889
5609. such a group of thermometers	was obtained and calibrated at the nbs	642.2368795264376
5610. these thermometers	have now been sent to the united kingdom for calibration at the national	physical laboratory	2134.0852932738653

5653. mr speaker for several years now the commuter	railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly	difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population	wants and is entitled to have	3644.3445993643863
5654. the causes of the decline of the commuter	railroads are many and complex- high taxes losses of revenue to	government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two	4653.188832747166
5655. and	the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally	varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete	discontinuance of this important service	2975.634104359799
5656. there have been a number	of sound plans proposed	393.41099736883984
5657. but none of these has been implemented	94.59881686178586
5658. instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service	decline and have failed to offer a helping hand	2819.363466335993
5659. though the number	of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased	tremendously since world war 2 total annual rail commutation	dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957	3557.39894699428
5660. nowhere has this decline	been more painfully evident than in the new york city area	1646.6735837404728
5661. here the	new york central railroad one of the nation's most important	carriers has alone lost 47	1414.5914596370076
5662. 6 percent of its passengers since 1949	140.46052844132456
5663. at this time of crisis in our nation's commuter railroads	a new threat to the continued operations of the new york central has	appeared in the form of the chesapeake + ohio railroad's proposal	for control of the baltimore + ohio railroads	2626.7351662373667
5664. the new york	central has pointed out that this control if approved by the interstate	commerce commission would give the combined c + o-b	+ o railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the	new york central	3686.1893970752462
5665. not only is this kind of duplication wasteful	but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic	away from the new york central and other railroads serving the area	3445.5534575010483
5666. the new york central notes:   the freight traffic	most susceptible to raiding by the c + o-b + o provides	the backbone of central's revenues	1649.2745854726084
5667. these revenues make it	possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire	new york central system as well as the new york area commuter	and terminal freight services	3342.5095929280556
5668. if these services are to be maintained	the new york central must have the revenues to make them possible	2588.3180540189596
5669. the new york central today handles 60 percent of all	southbound commuter traffic coming into new york city	1566.821935922846
5670. this is a	$14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work on commuter	traffic exclusively	1639.4282116039005
5671. a blow to this phase of the central's operations	would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad	itself but to the 40000 people per day who are provided with efficient	reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city	4293.624276783919
5672. there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful	c + o-b + o merger scheme-   the central	has pointed out	1365.1046243462977
5673. the logic of creating a strong balanced	competitive two-system railroad service in the east is so obvious	that b + o was publicly committed to the approach outlined here	2147.9426853188775
5674. detailed studies of the plan were well underway	250.2706794627351
5675. though	far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings	would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads	concerned their investors their customers their users and to the	public at large	3851.5139925611256
5676. then abandoning the studies in the face of	their promising outlook for all concerned b + o entered on-again-off-again	negotiations with c + o which resulted in the present	situation	2356.1559048450736
5677. in the light of the facts at hand however	new york central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create	a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest	3340.953349706604
5678. the interstate commerce commission will commence its	deliberations on the proposed c + o-b + o merger on	june 18	968.3057202561151
5679. obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force	the new york central to further curtail its commuter operations	by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge	3218.672137440392
5680. however there is a more profound consideration to this proposed	merger than profit and loss	1655.7380220818868
5681. that is will it serve the long-range	public interest	262.92377423849507
5682. for the past 40 years congress has advocated	a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system	1895.0802832449203
5683. we must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter-	the two-way b + o-c + o merger or the three-way	new york central-b + o-c + o merger	904.2838434343519
5684. which will	serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests	of all the traveling public	2601.403474611611
5685. mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to	a great newspaper the new york times on the occasion of a major change	in its top executive command	2980.583282076593
5686. arthur hays sulzberger has	been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and	it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to american	journalism on the occasion of his retirement	5470.296779632029
5687. i am pleased to	note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the	board of the new york times	2166.9139332584564
5688. mr sulzberger's successor	as publisher is mr orvil e dryfoos who is president of the	new york times co and who has been with the times since 1942	4468.465372485493
5689. mr dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that	the high standards which have made the times one of the world's	great newspapers will be maintained	2743.1711617798765
5690. i am also pleased to note	that mr john b oakes a member of the times staff since 1946	has been appointed as editorial page editor	4092.602083308518
5691. mr oakes succeeds	charles merz editor since 1938 who now becomes editor emeritus	782.4283517237083
5692. i should like at this time mr speaker to pay warm tribute	to arthur hays sulzberger and charles merz on the occasion of	their retirement from distinguished careers in american journalism	4986.002036886112
5693. my heartiest congratulations go to their successors orvil e	dryfoos and john b oakes who can be counted upon to sustain	the illustrious tradition of the new york times	3105.5698948587856
5694. the people	of the 17th district of new york and i as their representative	in congress take great pride in the new york times as one of the	great and authoritative newspapers of the world	5642.215634974766
5695. mr speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents	i urged the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba as the	only effective method of preventing continued soviet armaments from	coming into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine	4312.794385443161
5696. yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article	in the us news + world report of may 8 which discussed this	type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its	disadvantages	4272.622528903898
5697. under leave to extend my remarks i include	the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the	article from the us news + world report:	cuban ssr: whatever may have been the setbacks resulting	from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish	a beachhead on the castro-held mainland last week there was at least	one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the	whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian-dominated	military base	0.20124717349522497
5698. in fact one of the major reasons for the	failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full	information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian	military equipment	5757.095920393131
5699. somehow the pictures and stories of soviet	t-34 tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing	rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth	of what it means to have a russian military base 90 miles away from	home	4679.150383432714
5700. russian tanks and planes in cuba jeopardize the security of	the united states violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the	security of every other latin american republic	4283.940252038706
5701. once the full	extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president	kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate	to prevent this even if we had to go it alone	3659.842086015792
5702. but the latin american	republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on	taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally	throwing cuba off the inter-american defense board	5316.3556503158115
5703. for years	the united states had been trying to get these countries to exclude	castro's representative from secret military talks	1885.4084247647631
5704. but it took the	pictures of the migs and the t-34 tanks to do the job	1891.5830121230167
5705. there	is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week	500.09089987996083
5706. you can see	it for example in the extensive efforts president kennedy has made	to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both cuba	and laos; efforts	as i see it which are being directed by the way toward	support for future actions not for those already past	7369.033812443224
5707. what	the next move will be only time of course will tell	639.3123281096506
5708. personally	i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba	1409.2793487282747
5709. we	simply can't tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility	of long-range nuclear missiles being located in cuba	1574.6273817994283
5710. obviously	we can't stop them from coming in however just by talk	960.9089942429794
5711. a naval	blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe doctrine would	be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an	abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere	3550.8453749913724
5712. us news + world report may 8 1961	_next for cuba:	look at castro now- cockier than ever	with arms and agents to threaten the americas	2693.6088844611327
5713. how can the	united states act	43.60835166345841
5714. blockade is one answer offered by experts	139.78271472454685
5715. in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish	castro too	1098.4739862927872
5716. this is the question now facing president	kennedy: how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to	communist infiltration of this hemisphere	4096.671812980548
5717. on april 25 the	white house reported that a total embargo of remaining us	trade with cuba was being considered	1886.2053701778157
5718. its aim: to undermine further	cuba's economy	142.31460554946014
5719. another strategy- bolder	and tougher- was also attracting notice in washington: a naval	and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro	2605.4062614528907
5720. blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore	teeth to the monroe doctrine	1893.3775215078942
5721. it could halt a flood of communist	arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro	942.1331787379889
5722. it could stop	cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to south america	1194.841117554867
5723. it would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the	united states could invoke against castro	1716.4056606515853
5724. it is the strategy	of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention	of administration officials members of congress officers in the	pentagon	3892.7343862479547
5725. as a possible course of action it also is the center of	what	would	military experts say a tight naval blockade	off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require	two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with	a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers	5155.302364844307
5726. the	navy on april 25 announced it is bringing back the carrier shangri-la	from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of	attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba	4673.6769708856355
5727. more than 36 other big navy	ships are no less than a day's sailing time away	1253.997455676777
5728. to round	out the blockading force submarines would be needed- to locate identify	and track approaching vessels	2124.7224180688722
5729. land-based radar would help with	this task	93.8256660180896
5730. so would radar picket ships	22.259519814224056
5731. a squadron of navy jets and	another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier	task forces	1741.7667614129969
5732. three requirements go with a blockade: it must	be proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce	it; and it must be enforced without discrimination	4266.849738530761
5733. once	these conditions of international law are met countries that try to	run to blockade do so at their own risk	2029.4394303901688
5734. blockade runners can be stopped-	by gunfire if necessary- searched and held at least temporarily	1641.790288055642
5735. they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo	should be confiscated	939.3775373010847
5736. in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe	doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere	2358.7299352481386
5737. it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war	strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration	951.0757019648912
5738. primary target	would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition	coming from russia and czechoslovakia	2118.4600869974292
5739. shipments of arms from western	countries could similarly be seized as contraband	642.3780283483217
5740. in a total blockade	action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals	oils textiles and even foodstuffs	2606.0955471848674
5741. at times three ships a day from	the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports	1100.7944852884582
5742. from its inception in 1920 with the passage of public law 236 66th	congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been	to assist the states by means of grants-in-aid to return disabled	men and women to productive gainful employment	6438.180284886469
5743. the authority for	the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation	program was made permanent as title 5 of the social security	act in 1935	2865.4422814259037
5744. up to this time and for the next eight years the services	provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling	and placement on a job	3913.7187235967745
5745. recognizing the limitations of such a program	the 78th congress in 1943 passed p l 113 which broadened	the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical	restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised	the financing structure	4301.552749714312
5746. despite the successful	rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first	eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be	inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million	disabled	6204.651927694658
5747. to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped	individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative	employment to the extent of their capabilities the 83rd	congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of 1954		2937.748071943981
5748. these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation	act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation	facilities for more sheltered and half-way workshops for	greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive	services to individuals	and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's	overall effectiveness	7135.411891403959
5749. under the law as it	existed until 1943 the federal government made grants to the states	on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a 50-50	basis	2991.838972434033
5750. under p l 113 78th congress the federal government	assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary state expenditures	in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of	the disabled and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients	with rehabilitation case services	6693.944874015551
5751. throughout these years the statutory	authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out	the provisions of the act	2026.696348184006
5752. the 1954 amendments completely changed	the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing	for a three-part grant structure- for extension	and improvement; and research demonstrations training and	traineeships for vocational rehabilitation- and in addition for	short-term training and instruction	6235.179736410325
5753. the first part of the new structure-	that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation	services- is described in this section	2174.9280606806556
5754. subsequent sections	on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure	957.832795417608
5755. the following table shows for selected years the authorizations	appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state	matching funds for this part of the grant program:	distributing funds	in order to assist	the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section	2 of the amended act provides that allotments to states for	support of such services be based on need as measured by a state's	population and fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita	income	0.20124717349522497
5756. the act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment	set at the 1954 level which is called the base allotment	and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state	4856.236007935063
5757. it stipulates	in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing	the ceiling	and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed	to those states still below their maximums	3329.961953301354
5758. these provisions	are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among	the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person	have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in	a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly	populated state	7544.6748216525375
5759. the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption	in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result	from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population	alone	3340.60992385126
5760. the method used in computing	the allotments is specifically set forth in the act	1419.5098669237436
5761. the term	state means the several states the district of columbia the	virgin islands guam and puerto rico; the term united states	includes the several states and the district of columbia and	excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior	to	1962 alaska and hawaii	4767.410829123362
5762. the following steps are employed in calculations:	for each state	determine	average per capita income based on the last three years	3030.192518551303
5763. determine the average per capita income for the u s	based on the last three years	1255.883673507647
5764. determine	the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the u s	determine	for each state	that percentage which	bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular state's average per	capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u s	7096.448806078294
5765. determine the particular	state's allotment percentage	43.354480748575156
5766. by law this is 75% for	the virgin islands guam and puerto rico	1189.1045245829127
5767. in all other states it is the difference obtained by subtracting	from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above; except that no	state shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-13% nor more	than 75%	3849.5078238774977
5768. if the resulting difference for the particular state is	less or more than these extremes the state's allotment percentage	must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme	4494.784777162758
5769. square	each state's allotment percentage	14.85936675674768
5770. multiply the population of each	state by the square of its allotment percentage	1179.7131728983525
5771. determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the	states	1089.7362210004128
5772. 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each state in item	determine the ratio that the amount being allotted	is to the sum of the products for all the states	5476.011782432189
5773. determine	the particular state's unadjusted allotment for the particular	fiscal year	502.8631291449383
5774. determine if the particular	state's unadjusted allotment	is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted	allotment to its maximum allotment	3690.6006694267576
5775. for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described	in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times	the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23000000	determine if	the particular state's unadjusted allotment	is less than its minimum allotment and if so raise	its unadjusted	allotment to its minimum allotment	5373.192809108617
5776. regardless of its unadjusted	allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment	each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954-	increased by a uniform percentage of 5	5486.934994566164
5777. 4865771 which brings total	1954 allotments to all states up to $23000000	634.858115969406
5778. the funds	recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used: first to increase	the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states	where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment	; and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those	states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments	to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum	7284.235683143093
5779. for the states which maintain	two separate agencies- one for the vocational rehabilitation of	the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the	blind- the act specifies that their minimum allotment shall	be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided	in fiscal year 1954	5150.000339173769
5780. funds allotted in addition to their minimum	allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine	2357.354201959132
5781. as	is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational	rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on	a statutory formula	2461.945957949059
5782. prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for	the minimum allotment state funds had to equal 1954 state funds	2834.723643592279
5783. prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched	at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot	of 40% state participation in total program	costs	3670.8158432316573
5784. the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any	state is referred to in the law as that state's federal share	3254.5972070755183
5785. for purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to	as the states unadjusted federal share	1254.5643366144604
5786. beginning in 1960 the	matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted	25% a year so that by 1963 the entire	support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot state	share with maximum and minimum state shares of 50% and 30% respectively	7167.0650875348
5787. the pre-1960 rate of federal participation with respect	to any state's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect	during the 1960-1962 period is designated by the statute as that	state's adjusted federal share	3853.681078744144
5788. the provisions for determining	a state's unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the	varying financial resources among the states	2811.9764709605483
5789. the purpose of the adjusted	federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition	provisions	for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent	method of computing	the method used for computing the respective	federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set	forth in the act	5044.182812888155
5790. the term state means the several states	the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico;	the term united states includes the several states and	the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam	and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii	7146.178516657645
5791. the following	steps are employed in the calculations:  for each state	determine the average per capita income for	the last three years	2174.987451334529
5792. determine the average	per capita income for the united states for the last three years	1648.142243199239
5793. same amount used in item 2 under method of computing allotments	determine the ratio of 40% to the average per	capita income of the united states	2719.6242376292125
5794. determine for each state		that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular	state's average per capita income bears to the average per	capita income of the united states	5144.215045481671
5795. determine the particular state's federal share	43.405296506712816
5796. by	law this is 70% for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico	1187.976579120464
5797. in all other states it is the difference	obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4	above; except	that no state shall have a federal share less than	50% nor more than 70%	3849.589008872069
5798. if the resulting difference for the particular	state is less or more than these extremes the state's federal	share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme	4495.310212563721
5799. at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested	on the inside 4 inches of the block wall	2029.1437396311117
5800. the outside 4-inch space is	filled by mortaring blocks on edge	753.6376719424422
5801. the wooden bracing between the roof	beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall	1250.9463942772757
5802. mortar is poured	between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the	wall thickness for radiation shielding	2817.181062514834
5803. the first one or two roof boards	are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside	the shelter	1728.5920395524245
5804. these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up	through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter	3265.3261336499204
5805. concrete	blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards	640.5906452805978
5806. the	roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together	955.8634506985529
5807. work on the roof continues in this way	166.0871251301076
5808. the last roof boards are covered	with blocks from outside the shelter	961.1733187085995
5809. when the roof blocks	are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position	1562.4397504461035
5810. building plans are	on page 21	65.35009639754827
5811. solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense	are used for this shelter	638.6836642561209
5812. these blocks are sold in various sizes	so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit	2357.3763613828214
5813. solid blocks	are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete	to give effective protection	1568.0836587734395
5814. if they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give	the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks	3686.296043245783
5815. the	illustrations in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall	786.5779091412394
5816. more	detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply	houses and craftsmen	1410.8448201550423

5818. an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete	blocks	951.6515227040843
5819. most people would	have to hire a contractor to build this shelter	636.3848217341216
5820. plans are on pages	22 and 23	140.28375811491114
5821. this shelter could be built in regions where water	or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground	shelter	2463.3960354890905
5822. two walls of concrete blocks are constructed	at least 20 inches apart	954.9228871580568
5823. the space between them is filled with pit-run	gravel or earth	503.23284259070397
5824. the walls are held together with metal ties placed	in the wet mortar as the walls are built	2351.6479208656647
5825. the roof shown here	is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete covered with at	least 20 inches of pit-run gravel	1869.2969192563837
5826. an alternate roof perhaps more	within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof	beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing	3031.229775339518
5827. it would have to be covered	with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel	933.8528878644553
5828. the materials	for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700	567.4177854000469
5829. contractors' charges	would be additional	14.854466345777436
5830. the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout	protection	249.31498978775556
5831. pre-shaped corrugated	metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either	above or below ground	1412.3845258522358
5832. these are particularly suitable for regions where	water or rock is close to the surface	1651.0552856344234
5833. they form effective fallout	shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure 10	1102.5386878281201
5834. materials for this shelter would cost about $700	252.22771837406071
5835. a contractor probably	would be required to help build it	371.97709101757806
5836. his charges would be added to	the cost of materials	561.327943356332
5837. this shelter as shown on page 24 would provide	almost absolute protection from fallout radiation	1100.6271508332313
5838. an alternate	hatchway entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials	$50 to $100	2128.22046369898
5839. the national lumber manufacturers association	washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially	treated lumber for underground shelter construction	1894.180763088631
5840. the structural	clay products institute washington dc is working to develop	underground	an underground reinforced concrete shelter	can be built by a contractor for about $1000 to $1500 depending	on the type of entrance	5481.6179142878655
5841. the shelter shown would provide almost absolute	fallout protection	261.38595784266994
5842. the illustration shows this	shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over	1408.07964262051
5843. the same shelter	could be built into an embankment or below ground level	791.2932516291736
5844. plans	for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown	on pages 26 and 27	2376.601776870858
5845. another type of shelter which gives excellent	fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement	of a home under construction	2473.175312256273
5846. it would add about $500 to the total	cost of the home	961.0288228044019
5847. the shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such	a room built in a new home in the washington dc area in the	spring of 1959	2854.7066344776663
5848. common	to each type of shelter are:  arrangement of the entrance	751.7057080720576
5849. must have at least one right-angle turn	94.1776367680027
5850. radiation scatters somewhat like light	22.46754030821423
5851. some will go around a corner	43.99868575306737
5852. the rest continues in a straight line	140.91816057598547
5853. therefore sharp turns	in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter	944.6107699829965
5854. is provided in a concrete block basement	shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance	2365.225114141441
5855. a blower	may be installed to increase comfort	165.20910166869152
5856. a blower is essential	for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters	1188.3159762233608
5857. it should	provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person	1089.1140721857907
5858. vent	pipes also are necessary but	filters are not	392.87771011456783
5859. is cut down by the	shielding necessary to keep out radiation	500.35689051642623
5860. as soon as the shelter is	completed a radio reception check must be made	1422.7263582034402
5861. it probably will be	necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad	broadcasts	1098.2997923771168
5862. continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the	shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere	flashlight-type bulb	3683.3695353271796
5863. tests have shown that such a device	with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least	10 days	1890.9049150364
5864. with a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more	would be assured	1894.5938717502704
5865. a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available	for those periods when a brighter light is needed	1581.33609838335
5866. there should	be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue	in many areas	2120.0593232730903
5867. if there	are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter	they should be shielded as shown in the appendix page 29	2612.3732862984016
5868. other basement	windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens	560.6727753644361
5869. basement	walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the	appendix page 29	1417.7054830905447
5870. in these shelters the entrance should be	not more than 2 feet wide	1184.3559106877262
5871. bunks or materials to build them may have	to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed	1875.0017787177167
5872. the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado	or hurricane protection	1181.073730629993
5873. the	radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first	166.73638031354864
5874. forty-nine hours	after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent	of what it was an hour after the explosion	3508.539928582607
5875. but the radiation may	be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous	1414.561747931429
5876. therefore civil defense instructions received over conelrad	or by other means should be followed	1415.9672957155485
5877. a battery-powered	radio is essential	14.847922680994253
5878. radiation instruments suitable for home use are	available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home	which offers the best protection against fallout radiation	4464.018443236348
5879. there is	a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters	may become available	931.6574111123491
5880. one instrument thus would serve both purposes	141.9205922213368
5881. your local civil defense will gather its own information and	will receive broad information from state and federal sources	1740.0889400892356
5882. it	will tell you as soon as possible:   how long to stay in your	shelter	1642.8715646251978
5883. how soon you may go outdoors	43.66013176579992
5884. how long you	may stay outside	64.92920146420661
5885. you should be prepared to stay in your shelter	full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14	days or longer	2838.7023664139642
5886. a checklist in the appendix tells what is	needed	394.10495373513965
5887. families with children will have particular problems	94.32589818395255
5888. they	should provide for simple recreation	65.34542090774676
5889. there should be a task	for everyone and these tasks should be rotated	793.0583211005769
5890. part of the family should	be sleeping while the rest is awake	958.5501652014707
5891. to break the monotony	it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy	1407.9376814801467
5892. records such as diaries can be kept	140.72504004396885
5893. the survival of the family	will depend largely on information received by radio	794.8330690650282
5894. a record should	be kept of the information and instructions including the time and	date of broadcast	2113.633302467013
5895. family rationing probably will be necessary	43.61450068517324
5896. blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule	392.6882803600506
5897. there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation	has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement	2180.3929104988874
5898. however as	much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation	exposure to a minimum	2608.3424808453374
5899. the housekeeping problems of living	in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied	1423.88593738814
5900. food medical	supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the	shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it	3258.3159365116567
5901. after	the family has settled in the shelter the housekeeping rules should	be spelled out by the adult in charge	1882.1863858325191
5902. sanitation in the confines	of the family shelter will require much thought and planning	1406.685331656739
5903. provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human	wastes will be an unfamiliar problem	1100.5849611873398
5904. a covered container such as a kitchen	garbage pail might do as a toilet	1422.6823638597216
5905. a 10-gallon garbage can with	a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it	is safe to leave the shelter	2464.0540992967813
5906. water rationing will be difficult	and should be planned carefully	563.3338912638064
5907. a portable electric heater	is advisable for shelters in cold climates	501.9961361645086
5908. it would take the chill from	the shelter in the beginning	761.9033555491649
5909. even if the electric power fails after	an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter	that much more comfortable	2594.825585951197
5910. body heat in the close quarters will	help keep up the temperature	964.6267809341047
5911. warm clothing and bedding of course	are essential	166.98415379762756
5912. open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided	140.92679492326747
5913. a flame would use up air	43.238584868665605
5914. some families already have held	weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to	determine for themselves what supplies they would need	3893.327125021803
5915. an attack finds you without a prepared shelter	few areas if any	are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about	2456.1790896621906
5916. a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding	from fallout radiation	1194.7616357386928
5917. on the ground floor the radiation would	be about half what it is outside	943.0138772589869
5918. the best protection would be on	the ground floor in the central part of the house	1885.096571073023
5919. a belowground	basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside	level	942.7719151109656
5920. the safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows	and deepest below ground	1659.5075252777283
5921. if there is time after the warning	the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking	windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material	2742.260649396852
5922. large apartment buildings	of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual	family dwellings	1876.540951013177
5923. in general such apartments afford more protection	than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is	more space	1880.2327436358778
5924. the central area of the ground floor of a heavily	constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide	more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling	4660.351962745364
5925. the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural	protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended	for the basement of a family dwelling	2991.0109698218475
5926. the federal	government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential	commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout	protection they would provide and for how many people	4817.674245020435
5927. the	problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use	of existing space	1264.6974532926886
5928. such planning will require the cooperation of other	occupants and of the apartment management	1412.6493139877653
5929. a former du pont official became a general motors vice president	and set about maximizing du pont's share of the general motors	market	2320.406387827546
5930. lines of communications were established between the two	companies and several du pont products were actively promoted	2115.1169477350004
5931. within	a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire	requirements of from four to seven of general motors' eight operating	divisions	2592.1631891070438
5932. the fisher body division long controlled by the	fisher brothers under a voting trust even though general motors owned	a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years	but by 1947 and 1948 resistance had collapsed and its purchases	from du pont compared favorably with purchases by other general	motors divisions	7802.293372692826
5933. competitors came to receive higher percentage	of general motors business in later years but it is likely	that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general	motors outstripping du pont's capacity	3733.5273771090424
5934. the fact	that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du pont's	production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements	of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont	by a stock interest	6556.069161562411
5935. the inference is overwhelming that du pont's	commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained	solely on competitive merit	2312.5861304904515
5936. 353 u s at 605	22.068708972151658
5937. this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price	quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general	motors	2456.7562197379834
5938. 353 u s at 606	22.2569310126372
5939. however it determined that	neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive	posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the	honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own	company and without any design to overreach anyone including du pont's	competitors 353 u s at 607 outweighed the government's	claim for relief	5645.707987185082
5940. this claim as submitted to the district	court and dismissed by it 126 fsupp235 alleged violation	not only of  7 of the clayton act but also of   1 and 2 of	the sherman act	5478.665879106253
5941. the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination	or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and	monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize	such trade	2991.980556056974
5942. however this court put to one side without consideration	the government's appeal from the dismissal of its sherman	act allegations	2828.144306422427
5943. it rested its decision solely on  7 which reads	in pertinent part:   no corporation engaged in commerce	shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of	the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in	commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially	lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired	and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce	in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any	line of commerce	0.20124717349522497
5944. this section shall not apply to corporations	purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same	by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about	the substantial lessening of competition h	5933.600002106485
5945. the purpose	of this provision was thus explained in the court's opinion:	section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only	the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation	of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation	but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies	in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the	time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation	of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation	0.20124717349522497
5946. the section	is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial	lessening of competition have occurred or are intended h	3507.069311110692
5947. 353 u s at 589	14.870317089324084
5948. thus a finding of conspiracy to	restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the court's	decision	2363.946470690706
5949. indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption	that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont	and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised	their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests	of their own companies	4616.309271814049
5950. this however did not bar finding that du	pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and	finishes to general motors; that these products constituted a line	of commerce within the meaning of the clayton act; that general	motors' share of the market for these products was substantial;	and that competition for this share of the market was endangered	by the financial relationship between the two concerns:   the	statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered	when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition	of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned	by the statute	0.30166232349522504
5951. we repeat that the test of a violation of  7 is	whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that	the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints	3552.458996878892
5952. the	conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved	as to this acquisition h	2122.8245889146874
5953. 353 u s at 607	14.761660468612964
5954. on	the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the court remanded	the case to the district court to determine the appropriate	relief	3880.140125832161
5955. the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed	to it was this:   the judgment must therefore be reversed	and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination	after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate	in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition	offensive to the statute	5384.0704246877085
5956. the district courts in the framing	of equitable decrees are clothed 'with large discretion to model	their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case'	4077.6544399185173
5957. international	salt co	v united states 332 u s 392	400-401	497.6089780844474
5958. 353 u s at 607-608	22.221976954586967
5959. this brings us to the	course of the proceedings in the district court	787.8429479658711
5960. this	court's judgment was filed in the district court on july 18	1957	1180.1532683140254
5961. the first pretrial conference- held to appoint amici curiae	to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general	motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent	hearings- took place on september 25 1957	4221.352249416298
5962. at the outset the	government's spokesman explained that counsel for the government	and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view	to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court	6078.545832545644
5963. du pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its general	motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont-general	motors relationship	2179.495565074762
5964. the government deeming these suggestions inadequate	had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du pont's	shares of general motors	2805.5620213353795
5965. counsel for the government invited	du pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program	but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont	thought further discussion would not be profitable the government	was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days	4766.63809343213
5966. counsel for	du pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by	both sides at an early date	2815.8447282873367
5967. no previous antitrust case he said had	involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems	of relief	1726.97229563068
5968. the submission of detailed plans would place the issues	before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture	or disenfranchisement in the abstract	3718.4857470502184
5969. the court adopted this procedure	with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out	935.4135115449302
5970. the	government submitted its proposed decree on october 25 1957	563.8226260717082
5971. the	plan called for divestiture by du pont of its 63000000 shares of general	motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders	as a dividend over a period of ten years	3433.8137347171187
5972. christiana securities company	and delaware realty + investment company major stockholders	in du pont and the stockholders of delaware were dealt with specially	by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee again over	a ten-year period of du pont's general motors stock allocable to	them as well as any general motors stock which christiana and delaware	owned outright	6828.243310993434
5973. if in the trustee's judgment reasonable	market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to	be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the	ten-year period	3554.3224929767775
5974. in addition the right to vote the general motors	stock held by du pont was to be vested in du pont's stockholders	other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware;	du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring	stock in or exercising control over general motors; du pont	christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director	or officer in common with general motors and vice versa; and	general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement	that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified	percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product	or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general	motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any	chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any	joint commercial enterprise by the two companies	0.30166232349522504
5975. on motion of	the amici	curiae the court directed that a ruling be obtained from	the commissioner of internal revenue as to the federal income tax	consequences of the government's plan	3375.1101768218623
5976. on may 9 1958 the commissioner	announced his rulings	393.2989403557618
5977. the annual dividends paid to du pont	stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary	income to the extent of du pont's earnings and profits	3098.3495539307614
5978. the	measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual	stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time	of each annual distribution	4644.689044877822
5979. in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders	the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value	of the shares or du pont's tax basis for them which is approximately	$2	3440.4684724799163
5980. the forced sale of the general motors stock owned	by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of	delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those	parties at the capital gains rate	6076.760135162823
5981. du pont's counterproposal	was filed on may 14 1958	259.7417709450102
5982. under its plan du pont would retain	its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders	the right to vote those shares	4077.420040877507
5983. christiana and delaware would	in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors	shares allocable to them to their own stockholders	2727.746026786423
5984. du pont would	be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone	who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and	no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director	of general motors without court approval	6825.497185337958
5985. du pont would be denied	the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except	through general motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights	to its stockholders	2854.93962118957
5986. on june 6 1958 general motors submitted	its objections to the government's proposal	1182.4624040666472
5987. it argued inter	alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market	value of the stock of both general motors and du pont with consequent	serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent	investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions;	that there would be a similar decline in the market values of	other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders	of those companies; that the tremendous volume of general	motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts	of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise	equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect	on the entire stock market and on general business activity	0.20124717349522497
5988. general	motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would	not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this	court	3493.379650450627
5989. the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed	in august of 1958	786.4855396206211
5990. these plans like du pont's contained provisions	for passing the vote on du pont's general motors shares on	to the ultimate stockholders of du pont christiana and delaware	except that officers and directors of the three companies their spouses	and other people living in their households as well as other specified	persons were to be totally disenfranchised	8026.577149533742
5991. both plans also prohibited	common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana	and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the	other	2610.370965943058
5992. it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense	to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such	a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger	the confidentiality of the marriage relationship	6808.131390539468
5993. while it is easy	enough to ridicule hawkins' pronouncement in pleas of the crown	from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness	of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between	husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be	regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage	5599.815713447135
5994. by	making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which	congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today	continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt	v united states 362 us 525 where the court held that	under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to	testify against her husband over her objection	8545.65817226311
5995. one need not waver in	his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other	things in american life which are also of great importance and to which	even law enforcement must accommodate itself	3841.9157259032872
5996. one of these is the	solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage	964.6238971690515
5997. the court's	opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine	does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine	enthrones an unreality into a rule of law	3227.4927733706213
5998. i am not	easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries	can be so lightly dismissed	3267.6268901028425
5999. but in any event i submit that	the power to depose belongs to congress not to this court	1572.378749263053
6000. petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted	of violating  12 of the universal military training and service	act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces	4828.508341182918

6003. pp	petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's	notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular	need for them and he did have a copy of the department of justice's	petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at	the department of justice or at his trial to inspect the original report	of the federal bureau of investigation since he was furnished	a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular	need for the original report	0.20124717349522497
6004. haydn c	covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner	965.4361593504979
6005. daniel m friedman argued the cause for the united states	375.20045854317584
6006. on the brief were solicitor general rankin assistant attorney	general wilkey beatrice rosenberg and j f bishop	2129.578921209536
6007. mr justice clark delivered the opinion of the court	262.41346464004994
6008. this is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the	armed services in violation of the provisions of the universal military	training and service act 62 stat 604 622 50 usc	app  462	5479.079179311939
6009. petitioner who claims to be a conscientious	objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings	before a hearing officer of the department of justice and at	trial	3334.750493709088
6010. he says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing	officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further	that he was denied at trial the right to have the department of justice	hearing officer's report and the original report of the federal	bureau of investigation as to his claim- all in violation of the	fifth amendment	8356.602025638082
6011. the trial judge decided that the administrative procedures	of the act were fully complied with and refused to require	the production of such documents	2456.317085382505
6012. petitioner was found guilty and sentenced	to 15 months' imprisonment	561.4233523622952
6013. the court of appeals affirmed	14.787615474763609
6014. we granted certiorari in view of the importance of	the questions in the administration of the act	2121.8982725764104
6015. we have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale	of gonzales v united states 348 us 407		and united states v nugent 346 us 1	and therefore affirm the judgment	3440.386804965493
6016. petitioner registered with	local board no 9 boulder colorado on march 17 1952	1183.7864099946598
6017. his	answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a	minister of jehovah's witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer	2167.7807389036207
6018. he claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion	devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching	2595.636370696735
6019. on november	13 1952 he was classified in class 1-a	373.39585620005874
6020. on november 22	1952 he wrote the board protesting this classification	757.2388839369472
6021. he again stated	that he was a regular minister; that he was devoting	an average	of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to	50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in	any form	4433.911328017072
6022. thereafter he was classified 1-o	22.415103378580106
6023. on april 1 1953	after some six months of full-time pioneering petitioner discontinued	devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so	notify his local board	2974.9372652094803
6024. in a periodic review the local board on july	30 1953 reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification	after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness	to kill in defense of his church and home	5923.060190916771
6025. upon administrative approval	of the reclassification he was ordered to report for induction on	june 11 1956 but failed to do so	2169.6013141172107
6026. he was not prosecuted however	and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella	v united states 348 us 385	3245.8685021333104
6027. he was again	reclassified 1-a by the local board	261.4294442357293
6028. there followed a customary	department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared	958.2566945941877
6029. in	his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that	the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service	2196.593793447826
6030. on march 21 1957 however the department recommended approval of	the 1-a classification	1178.145934781581
6031. its ground for this recommendation was	that while petitioner claimed before the local board august 17 1956	that he	was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters	of the jehovah's witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so	and on the contrary had relinquished both his pioneer and bible	student servant positions	5312.817260800027
6032. it reported that he now devoted only some	6-12 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per	month to church activities	4121.158799136791
6033. his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated	the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his	veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith	2576.4280997232536
6034. the	appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation	565.8407534754102
6035. in	his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement	in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to pioneering	was in 1952	2986.1911793149347
6036. the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the	department's recommendation	557.8587731800851
6037. upon return of the file to the local	board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this	prosecution followed his failure to do so	2731.924277929076
6038. petitioner first contends	that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving	him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal	board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim	of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching	6777.757657618281
6039. but the statement of the	local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file	1251.247059500855
6040. he	admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have	rebutted it before the hearing officer	3481.1925267468555
6041. this he failed to do asserting	that he did not know it to be in his file	1406.656224055787
6042. apparently he never	took the trouble to find out	388.5221032927103
6043. nevertheless he had ample opportunity	to contest the statement before the appeal board	791.9201619593871
6044. after the recommendation	of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the	appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial	3694.9833915584654
6045. we found in gonzales v united states supra that this	was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be	furnished a registrant	2453.6254959028
6046. we said there that it was necessary that	a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the department's	recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the	ultimate responsibility for classification	5479.403601490629
6047. we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's	contention which was considered by the appeal board and	denied by it	2583.227479453345
6048. as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board	which renders the selective service determination considered 'final'	in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact	5137.415311089005
6049. estep v united states 327 us 114	93.10461008175155
6050. 348	u	s at 412-413	22.164030567642193
6051. but there are other contentions which might	be considered more difficult	499.0752816981453
6052. at his trial petitioner sought to secure	through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the department's	hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon	4116.461678674078
6053. petitioner	also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal	bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice	2029.2505521558203
6054. he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld; nor	did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of	investigation reports might disclose	3885.109764230537
6055. section 6 of the	act	as we have held does require the department's recommendation to	be placed in a registrant's file	2038.4901891389359
6056. gonzales v united states	supra	22.02099490756003
6057. but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing	officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant	1887.963413801237
6058. while	the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report	be placed in the registrant's file this requirement was eliminated	in 1952	3260.0805021215506
6059. moreover the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental	is directed to the attorney general and of course is not	the recommendation of the department	2478.337364075128
6060. it is not essentially different	from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of	which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give	his approval or rejection	5334.45807858864
6061. it is but part of the whole process within	the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation	to the appeal board	2467.341761158871
6062. it is also significant that neither this	report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal	board	2584.0052570629796
6063. hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only	conclusions of the department on file with the board	1731.4686767635462
6064. petitioner	knew that the department's recommendation was based not on the hearing	officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his	file	3892.362478731201
6065. having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local	board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner	cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed	3866.882493901617
6066. it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the	production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial	3266.4175790501276
6067. in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the	report and notes	1098.2004414852331
6068. while there are now allegations of the withholding	of favorable evidence developed at the hearing and a denial of	a full and fair hearing no such claim was made by petitioner at	any stage of the administrative process	6042.9026133222405
6069. moreover his testimony at	trial never developed any such facts	373.1454891915946
6070. in the light of these circumstances	as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered	entirely on the department's recommendation which petitioner	repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found	supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's	report and notes	7807.8400316319185
6071. finally petitioner says that he was entitled	to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the	hearing officer as well as at the trial	2604.2977482272927
6072. he did receive a resume of	it- the same that was furnished the appeal board- and he made no	claim of its inaccuracy	3477.035034428702
6073. even now no such claim is asserted	94.06124979419465
6074. he bases	his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that	he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume	3255.9122171980844
6075. but this is fully	answered by united states v nugent supra	500.74819476625
6076. there we held	that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service	system h entitles conscientious objectors to no guarantee	that	the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection	5002.621164482551
6077. even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner	here would not be entitled to the report	1409.1631129238026
6078. the recommendation of	the department- as well as the decision of the appeal board- was	based entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report	4282.7070548703505
6079. with this enlarged role in	mind i should like to make a few suggestions: what we in the united	states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what	happens in the rest of the world	4223.342963668888
6080. we in this department must think about	foreign policy in its total context	1175.4851424729072
6081. we cannot regard foreign policy	as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal	policy has been extracted	2036.458640330322
6082. foreign policy is the total involvement	of the american people with peoples and governments abroad	1641.2282681180882
6083. that	means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must	think in terms of the total context of our situation	2580.553719883471
6084. it is the concern	of the department of state that the american people are safe and	secure- defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense	4470.792245945779
6085. it is also the concern of the department of state that our	trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable	and active- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of	concern only to the department of commerce	4471.663727275579
6086. we can no longer rely on	interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences	between this and other departments	2348.5162287616567
6087. assistant secretaries of	state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination	of policies	1415.2191002631919
6088. means must be found to enable us to keep in	touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues	in other departments concerned with foreign policy	4464.076313944998
6089. i think we	need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action	786.7317238516687
6090. every	policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer	563.632885064203
6091. unless we keep	our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target	with the present	1873.6424788154593
6092. the movement of events is so fast the pace so	severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are	to think accurately about the present	4838.7803067622945
6093. if there is anything which we	can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes	by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act	promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct	of our affairs	4822.114270463621
6094. action taken today is often far more valuable than action	taken several months later in response to a situation then out of	control	3453.3901720160693
6095. there will of course be times for delay and inaction	373.065990921095
6096. what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act	we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic	or procedural difficulties	4661.892642422419
6097. i also hope that we can	do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction	of all bureaucracies	2036.1372975848444
6098. we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom	to the top of the department	1417.3537670097448
6099. we want to make sure that our junior	colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right	down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top	3208.731244098383
6100. i hope no one	expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources	of ideas	1897.2065280876236
6101. the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating	ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function	regardless of rank	2603.3447563485206
6102. further i would hope that we could	pay attention to little things	957.2054380777117
6103. while observing the operations of	our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many	situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor	problems which spoiled our main effort	3926.2667309192366
6104. to cite only a few examples:	the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior	position	abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes	of a un delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate	housing in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar	circumstances in our capital can be easily be directed against the united	states and all that it stands for	0.30166232349522504
6105. dozens of seemingly small	matters go wrong all over the world	507.43698093943874
6106. sometimes those who know about them	are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them	2821.1785262078733
6107. i	would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and	overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the	responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can	do something about them	4210.906025210746
6108. if the department of state is to take	primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows	that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas	4074.2861627634265
6109. this does	not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational	interested responsible fashion	1419.551777543877
6110. he is expected to know about what	is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed	in his country	3259.671018602361
6111. he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct	to assist in any way he can	1247.1668401863922
6112. if any official operation abroad begins	to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and	to get suggestions for remedial action	4089.2449347253955
6113. it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts	which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing	up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy	is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion	for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government	5426.098828572917
6114. i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems	that a senior departmental policy officer faces	3048.8107166497266
6115. this means practically	everybody in this room	93.83277653614441
6116. whether it will strike home for you or not	will be for you to determine	1653.4101868878686
6117. the senior policy officer may	be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of	stimuli: an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague	a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another	department a communication from a foreign government or an american	ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the united	nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news	item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the	secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman	an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization	a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad	et cetera ad infinitum	0.20124717349522497
6118. the policy officer lives with his antennae	alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility	2352.7803135732993
6119. his first thought is about the question itself: is	there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is	it	2322.8524168562094
6120. for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job	is to know what the question is- that when it is accurately identified	it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed	frequently shapes the answer	6429.861377655192
6121. chewing it over with his colleagues	and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the	question- tentative because it may change as he explores it further	and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed	into one which can be answered	4962.295233915869
6122. meanwhile he has been thinking	about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can	never be complete and the general background much of which has already	been lost to history	5180.407065144985
6123. he is appreciative of the expert help available	to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine	at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently	policy-oriented conclusions	3567.506631012453
6124. he knows that he must give the expert his	place but he knows that he must also keep him in it	3047.1807027396135
6125. he is	already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action	including doing nothing	1254.66310430335
6126. he knows that he is thinking about action in	relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful	fog	3494.328916429268
6127. but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy	well-established precedents the commitments of the united states	under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood	notions of the american people about how we are to conduct	ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security	council papers accumulated in the department	5298.188833868928
6128. he will	not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting	results in the factual situation with which he is confronted	3254.460348160932
6129. he must	think about which of these principles must take precedence	500.0166834134078
6130. he will	know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his	problem because of crucial changes in circumstance	3030.3566296166437
6131. he is aware that	every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other	problem	945.2518566619689
6132. he must deal with the question of how to manage a part	when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole- when the whole	is too large to grasp	4813.5297071833675
6133. he must think of others who have a	stake in the question and in its answer	1251.343497803589
6134. who should be consulted among	his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies	of the government	2367.303732385004
6135. which american ambassadors could provide helpful	advice	93.71884115871089
6136. are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted	250.49366891207598
6137. what is the probable attitude of other governments including	those less directly involved	785.1755492284368
6138. how and at what stage and in what sequence	are other governments to be consulted	1642.749829001198
6139. if action is indicated	what kind of action is relevant to the problem	787.6978582915318
6140. the selection	of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted	inflammation of the problem itself	3067.1431065614593
6141. can the president or the secretary	act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money	be required	1739.4741152699917
6142. should the action be unilateral or multilateral	142.0231890243421
6143. is the matter one for the united nations or some other international	body	796.707359541269
6144. for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary	diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem	3040.864907688222
6145. what type of action can	hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad	1415.9466938463531
6146. for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret	and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned	by the readiness of the country to sustain it	5322.857795344373
6147. he is interested in	public opinion for two reasons: first because it is important in itself	and second because he knows that the american public cares about	a decent respect for the opinions of mankind	3760.9350262236426
6148. and given probable	public attitudes- about which reasonably good estimates can be made-	what action is called for to insure necessary support	3272.468355349273
6149. may	i add a caution on this particular point	262.1858084161263
6150. we do not want policy	officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves	too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign	policy action	4264.6541100273635
6151. in the first place our business is foreign policy	and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees	in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of	a problem	3570.1497729098437
6152. mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows	in the department of state don't know much about domestic politics	2801.9698249722996
6153. this is an important consideration	14.74578749129223
6154. if we sit here	reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports	that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested	opinion expressed in the absence of leadership	5315.376133818873
6155. what the american	people will do turns in large degree on their leadership	790.2892284487846
6156. we cannot	test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country	have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them	for support for the necessary action	5494.189601362653
6157. i doubt for example that	3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the	marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have said that the country	would have accepted such proposals	3754.1873095143683
6158. the problem in the	policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly	complicated factors- political military economic financial legal	legislative procedural administrative- to be sorted out and handled	within a political system which moves by consent in relation to	an external environment which cannot be under control	7613.671940964092
6159. and the	policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels	790.6773996401807
6160. while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one	sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and	some open only to men or to women	4856.78188847002
6161. the peace corps should not pay	the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for	full-time peace corps work on the same project	2998.91645891619
6162. there should	be no draft exemption because of peace corps service	752.6147158389301
6163. in most cases	service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary	deferment	1260.9790559391938
6164. peace corps volunteers obviously should not	be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united	states	2577.1010734270117
6165. nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in	health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid	2447.6468407182674
6166. the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation	for individual services	1179.8652453637503
6167. rather the principle should be akin	to that of the allowance	501.1039111054221
6168. peace corps volunteers should be given	just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living	1891.3525405249009
6169. they should	live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption	373.72643492396395
6170. wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts	560.5803521603658
6171. some special health requirements might have to be met	260.6810520979514
6172. for example	it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to	pay medical expenses of volunteers	2594.1782619850505
6173. perhaps existing public health	service state department and armed services medical facilities	can be utilized	1101.8689817841946
6174. for readjustment to the us volunteers	should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas	service based on the length of time served	4094.851782404449
6175. the government should the peace corps be established	167.50538860671523
6176. the idea	of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people	1656.8026601064812
6177. support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines	498.3481002192267
6178. the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension	to our approach to the world- an opportunity for the american	people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world	development	5793.258849368617
6179. for this the peace corps should be administered	by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole	overseas operation	2329.3119476819325
6180. pending the reorganization of our foreign	aid structure and program the peace corps should be established	as an agency in the department of state	3698.821307420704
6181. when the aid operations are	reorganized the peace corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional	unit	1103.231417952523
6182. meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located	in ica's facilities and depend on the state department and	ica for administrative support and when needed program assistance	4295.406097325745
6183. in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own	identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those	now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas	operations	3666.724282957418
6184. the peace corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory	work undertaken between now and when congress finally appropriates	special funds for it- or it can be launched now and in earnest	by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from	existing mutual security appropriations to permit a number of substantial	projects to start this summer	8302.563443430674
6185. the peace corps should	be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified	people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost	2722.953264343908
6186. nor	should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university	campuses	1644.4810018254307
6187. if launched in a careful but determined way within	the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred	persons in training this summer for placement next fall	3104.4736994578984
6188. within a year	or two several thousand might be in service	754.9004105217431
6189. it can then grow steadily	as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated	1420.4757529927856
6190. what would the first projects be	64.93658353703319
6191. in the first year there should	probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects	786.9518162408301
6192. the need here	is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified	volunteers in a short period of time is greatest	3685.5265748991274
6193. there would	however be a variety of other skills- medical agricultural engineering-	which would be called for in the first year through the private	agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers	to existing development projects	3948.095025748347
6194. the first year's projects	should also be spread through several countries in latin america	africa and asia	2129.04166087248
6195. although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every	newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to	receive it from the united states will vary from country to country	3573.6903417770927
6196. a certain skepticism about the coming of americans is to be expected	in many quarters	1654.7834033794866
6197. unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything	in their power to promote active hostility	1095.6326897112879
6198. but there are indications	that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers	and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate	their value and make many friends	5017.82357571136
6199. it is important however	that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war	but as a contribution to the world community	2727.820185487087
6200. in presenting it to	other governments and to the united nations we could propose that	every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the	united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating	committee	6231.568834984016
6201. we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly	international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside	citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands	3346.6483287396163
6202. in any case our peace corps personnel should be offered as technician	helpers in development projects of the un and other international	agencies	3485.9599799585094
6203. the peace corps is not a diplomatic or	propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership	1426.7474401502604
6204. our aim must be to learn as much as we teach	755.7496270951202
6205. the peace corps	offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems	of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country	needs for trained manpower	3463.463603050367
6206. if presented in this spirit the response	and the results will be immeasurably better	1415.1928999999668
6207. financed	0.20041515
6208. the already appropriated funds within the discretion of	the president and secretary of state under the mutual security	act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's	pilot programs of the peace corps	5646.842230668832
6209. if it is decided to make a	small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance	funds in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security	act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign	to the world	4690.754908995061
6210. congress should then be asked to give the peace corps	a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year	2595.6189399681907
6211. specifically	congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive	contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations	and the public at large	2193.692076583623
6212. for this must be the project of the whole	american people	753.9310449119405
6213. an advisory council of outstanding public figures	with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program	continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding	3215.917893162892
6214. steps should also be taken to link the food for peace	program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated	by the sale of us surplus food under pl 480 can be	put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps	personnel	7206.809007142579
6215. the extent to which participating bodies such as u	s voluntary agencies universities international organizations	and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should	share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully explored	4215.642697564293
6216. no matter how well	conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures	1176.3703581129662
6217. these	could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad	941.8797324110956
6218. but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the	peace corps is very great	1653.15153266193
6219. it can contribute to the development of	critical countries and regions	500.49865293133405
6220. it can promote international cooperation	and good will toward this country	752.776890558111
6221. it can also contribute to the	education of america and to more intelligent american participation	in the world	1572.813391028224
6222. with thousands of young americans going to work	in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly	involved in the world than ever before	3904.863061622582
6223. with colleges and universities	carrying a large part of the program and with students looking	toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational	curriculum and student seriousness	3236.29963648308
6224. the letters home the talks later	given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on	the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad-	all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible	american policies toward the world	7234.469843527766
6225. and this is meeting the world's	need too since what the world most needs from this country	is better understanding of the world	2324.9175767447623
6226. the peace corps thus can	add a new dimension to america's world policy- one for which people	here and abroad have long been waiting	3700.1465529461675
6227. as you said in your state	of the union message	374.3160174940256
6228. the problems h are towering and unprecedented-	and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well	2114.85045369126
6229. i recommend to the congress	the establishment of a permanent peace corps- a pool of trained	american men and women sent overseas by the us government	or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign	countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower	4476.710949796072
6230. i	have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on	a temporary pilot basis	1901.8305948881396
6231. the temporary peace corps will be	a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more	effective plans for a permanent organization	2468.0699440740855
6232. in addition by starting	the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and	women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them	in overseas positions by late fall	5772.799327994303
6233. this temporary peace corps is	being established under existing authority in the mutual security	act and will be located in the department of state	2470.229820346217
6234. its initial expenses	will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign	aid program	1646.5283522030525
6235. throughout the world the people of the newly	developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which	reflects their deepest desires	2187.6356199669526
6236. our own freedom and the future	of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability	to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity	liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty	6473.332143432334
6237. one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is	the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and	assist in the operation of development projects- men and women with	the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics	and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages	the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations	0.20124717349522497
6238. the vast task of economic development urgently requires	skilled people to do the work of the society- to help teach in the	schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of	sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling	for training and advanced knowledge	7024.497314226843
6239. to meet this urgent need	for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a peace	corps- an organization which will recruit and train american volunteers	sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations	3956.0331782395406
6240. this organization will differ from existing assistance programs	in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the	specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical	advice to work	5486.842309999708
6241. they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary	to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments	acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice	3231.2887176230934
6242. there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve	will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them	3444.8175781627688
6243. in 1960 one-quarter of the 92	43.376333242269354
6244. 5 million	recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for	the primary purpose of hunting and fishing	2589.267747828677
6245. hunter and fisherman visits	since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale	of hunting and fishing licenses	1879.8394983881913
6246. this use is expected to increase to	about 50 million visits by 1972	1183.4434784904497
6247. the long-range objective of habitat	management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and	game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment	3222.3602209449373
6248. the wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period	are:  revise and complete wildlife habitat management	and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination	between wildlife habitat management and other resources	5330.945204050848
6249. inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation	with other federal agencies and with the states in which national	forests and grasslands are located as a basis for orderly development	of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs including	big-game gamebird and small-game habitat surveys and investigations	on the 186 million acres of national forests and grasslands	fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81000 miles	of national forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes	and impoundments and participation in planning inspection and	control phases of all habitat improvement land- and water-use projects	conducted on national forest lands by states other federal agencies	and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife	and be in harmony with other resource values	0.20124717349522497
6250. improve food	and cover on 1	65.54828514583815
6251. 5 million acres of key wildlife areas	93.31306478837377
6252. develop	wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation	by clearing or controlled burning on 400000 acres	2578.1394087477806
6253. improve	7000 miles of fishing streams and 56000 acres of lakes by stabilizing	banks planting streamside cover and constructing channel improvements	2039.9869134245412
6254. the total adverse impact of disease insects	fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and	values of forest resources is not generally recognized	4093.4482851175926
6255. they kill and	destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage	values and disrupt uses	1415.8479896320869
6256. the loss in growth of sawtimber because	of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952	was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet	4266.826088352171
6257. if it were not for the	effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly	twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952	2863.4219017011737
6258. about 45 percent	of the loss in growth was attributable to disease 20 percent to	insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and	various other causes	4824.321148810966
6259. these destructive forces also have a seriously	adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows	and upon the other renewable forest resources	2322.4355031981027
6260. the long-range	objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below	the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management	of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and	high-level sustained yield of products and services	6183.226394052418
6261. this can be accomplished	substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities	and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical	fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention	detection and control of insect and disease infestations	4536.705194869915
6262. in	addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of	timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and	disease	3250.850154183843
6263. in the 10-year period	it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest	system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and	control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce	the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial	period	4868.658572355444
6264. this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present	level of protection	1409.054379064486
6265. the work will consist of:  intensification	of present activities through quicker more extensive and	more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks; more reliable	evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread	damage; quicker and more effective control action in the initial	stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic	4886.35049109535
6266. the initial suppression	activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated	1187.6151688887805
6267. continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension	of control to 250000 acres not now protected but which should	be managed for white pine production	2726.248991864405
6268. the objective is to achieve sufficient	effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment	plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance	control will be needed	5321.028513671741
6269. initiating a program to control	dwarfmistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better	stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites	2315.9184392857255
6270. coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities	to reduce losses	953.113282834454
6271. it is proposed	that in	10 years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and	other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for	intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the	fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads	4823.181768865473
6272. this	will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving	such protection	1643.7029009147595
6273. an additional 15 million acres will be given	a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation	2028.6024588118653
6274. meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for:	expansion modernization and development of fire control	to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many	fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted	standards	6323.520129853954
6275. this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present	level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews	and equipment use	2027.6827006832932
6276. this will include a stepped-up program of training	and development of personnel	958.4054252399494
6277. adoption and use of new and	modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires	while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning	intensely	2963.317984030952
6278. reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize	the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value	areas	2358.2000369890275
6279. this work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land	needing such treatment and will consist of burning 250000 acres of highly	hazardous debris concentration felling snags on 350000 acres of	high lightning-occurrence areas prescribed burning on 3	4121.493260074897
6280. 5 million acres	removing roadside fuel on 39000 acres and clearing and maintaining	11000 miles of firebreaks	2119.0166375364056
6281. rodent	control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of	the most serious infestations of harmful rodents such as porcupines	and mice on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands	3543.435742593313
6282. these	areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation	on the national forests	1883.9342517723048
6283. 8 million acres of rangelands	and 9	93.96800280891591
6284. 4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period	749.8423654449771
6285. control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means	of control are known	1093.044525205121
6286. the transportation	system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and	access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions	3488.872530374795
6287. this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by	the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system	administered by the secretary of agriculture	3104.160155939825
6288. both of these	systems are essential for the production development and use of the	national	forests	1878.2360663548413
6289. in the forest highway system there are now	24400 miles of public roads	785.4469484340276
6290. these are mostly through highways that	carry traffic going from one destination to another	1403.6070020909126
6291. because administration	of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary	of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties	this development program for the national forests does not include	estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system	nor to construct the additions to its that are needed	5189.422195682857
6292. it is estimated	that about 70000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed	to fully serve the national forests	2805.77673255187
6293. in the forest development	road and trail system there are now 162400 miles of roads and	106500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails	2468.6152088509125
6294. these roads are	largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which	is related to use of the national forests	3249.561550886916
6295. construction and maintenance	of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture	938.9099426817847
6296. it is estimated that about 542250 miles of forest development	roads and 80000 miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually	be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of	the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the	national forests on a continuing basis	7410.163073685753
6297. the ultimate trail system	will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization	and fire protection	1409.921004960403
6298. it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum	service to these important resources and watersheds	1642.4014117064532
6299. the presence	or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling	influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as:	and wildlife resources	from fire insects and disease;	the volume of timber that	can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent	the level	of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity	to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects	the protection of watershed lands from erosion	and overgrazing by animals	0.20124717349522497
6300. the existence of road systems	permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes	that is not otherwise possible	3257.075253240894
6301. furthermore roads that give	access to national forest timber are investments which pay their own	way over a period of years	2029.9563062644334
6302. use of these roads by the public results	in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve	2134.358873002152
6303. the	long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain	a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately	service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected	needs and optimum production of products and services	4383.794835847699
6304. for the	year 2000 this means servicing the protection requirements of a watershed	producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year	recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors	a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board	feet and 60 million acres of rangelands	7616.036787325643
6305. service at these	levels of production and utilization will eventually require the	construction of about 379900 miles of new roads and 6000 miles of new	trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105000	miles of roads and 10500 miles of trails	4549.087911194784
6306. about 26500 miles	of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of	new roads	2120.5266777955667
6307. about 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be	met by the year 2000	945.7553869580057
6308. program proposals for forest development	roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows:	complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79400	miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8000 miles of trails	5346.51518690407
6309. this constitutes	about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities	643.8975441093622
6310. approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on	roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed	by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by	the government through adjustment of stumpage prices	6433.495073543009
6311. provide	maintenance to full standards on the 268900 miles of existing access	roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during	the period	2740.369135741493
6312. within the	units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership	is quite irregular	1880.232603642428
6313. in some units national forest ownership is well	blocked together	371.86664304892514
6314. in many others the previous patenting of land	under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for	purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership	4832.612962971096
6315. within	exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands	there are about 40000000 acres in non-federal ownership	1412.3266316506856
6316. one consequence	is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners	of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring	national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are	developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public	of neighboring national forest land	7435.160324895875
6317. some privately held inholdings	are a source of direct damage to these federal lands	949.9177775940407
6318. and some which	are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes	are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing	nothing to the economy; there are no reasonable prospects	that these conditions will be corrected or changed	6585.384553273318
6319. lands in this last	category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern	states	1260.0598413524224
6320. the long-range objective is to bring about consolidation	of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through	purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts	for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development	or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests	and national grasslands	7698.160879399331
6321. strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now	undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history	1576.8383110164473
6322. the change of	emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made	with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected	in favor of the other	4832.8105949861565
6323. our military forces must be capable of	contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon	us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war	2721.5186984836882
6324. the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately	the present level- a year-end strength of 2489000 men and	women in the active forces	4482.222075202538
6325. the forces to be supported include an army	of 14 divisions and 870000 men; a navy of 817 active ships and	619000 men; a marine corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000	men; and an air force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men	4764.384204269528
6326. if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war	their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing	character and missions of the active forces	4645.497987923533
6327. quality and combat readiness	must take precedence over mere numbers	372.88858776221394
6328. under modern conditions	this is especially true of the ready reserve	752.4871887526887
6329. i have requested the	secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve	components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light	of the changing requirements of modern warfare	3857.7505836581468
6330. last year	the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength	limitations on the army reserve	1873.6962777724134
6331. similar restrictions on the	strength of the army national guard contained in the 1960 department	of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped	2326.9222800443667
6332. i strongly	recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on	the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility	to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity	5303.824436871752
6333. i again	proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve-	from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 respectively	to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961	3661.968871500526
6334. these	strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions	of the reserves in support of our national security objectives	3273.3676381838823
6335. about 30% of the expenditures for	the department of defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs	including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel	2708.770593415118
6336. these	expenditures are estimated to be $12	140.5482052198043
6337. 1 billion an increase of $187	million over 1960 reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel	more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency	pay and social security tax increases		2469.7027024942095
6338. retired pay costs are	increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial	increase in the number of retired personnel	3683.8099997379213
6339. these increased costs	are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures	for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength	of the army reserve components during 1961	3546.016660964837
6340. traditionally	rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate	to current rates of pay for active personnel	2570.5158635299053
6341. the 1958 military	pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6%	increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior	to its effective date of june 1 1958	3553.619419185218
6342. i endorse pending legislation	that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and	active duty pay rates	2121.4207167054874
6343. expenditures	for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed	forces are estimated to be $10	1571.4091836580233
6344. 3 billion in 1961 which is $184	million more than in 1960	961.9396484342421
6345. the increase stems largely from the growing	complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons	and equipment	1881.295692929675
6346. a substantial increase is estimated in the	cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense	program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications	are essential	5169.34245186185
6347. also the program for fleet modernization	will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures	1406.436786635933
6348. further	increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted	by the congress last year	1657.2495946746071
6349. other factors increasing operating	costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up 11% in two	years and of each steaming hour up 15%	2737.6455119890866
6350. in total these increases	in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining	programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units	and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements	in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces	6795.052017977784
6351. in the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 i recommended	immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 1951		1687.8231708676958
6352. this section prevents the military departments and	the office of civil and defense mobilization from carrying out certain	transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement	with the committees on armed services of the senate and the house	of representatives	6475.475514279946
6353. as i have stated previously the attorney	general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional	principles	1569.2337602651892
6354. accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress	at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but	to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless	a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise	6055.533492182733
6355. basic	long-line communications in alaska are now provided through federal	facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation	agency	2041.0256888191616
6356. the growing communications needs of this new state can best	be met as they have in other states through the operation and development	of such facilities by private enterprise	4641.750582667241
6357. legislation has already	been proposed to authorize the sale of these government-owned	systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable	2038.483782154803
6358. for the department of defense are for procurement research	development and construction programs	1178.773228296926
6359. in 1961 these expenditures	are estimated at $18	166.44050697406743
6360. 9 billion compared to $19	22.152658586093814
6361. the	decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement	are offset in part by increases for research and development and	for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles	guns and electronic devices	3851.7821489070325
6362. expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated	at about the same level as in 1960	1185.8433606637752
6363. new obligational authority	for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement	totals $4753	million which is $1390 million below that enacted for 1960	2464.6235276810894
6364. on the	other hand the new authority of $3825 million proposed for missile	procurement in 1961 is $581 million	higher than for 1960	3477.832934018289
6365. these contrasting trends in procurement reflect	the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our armed	forces in the years ahead	2183.9268764747826
6366. the department of defense appropriation	acts for the past several years have contained a rider which	limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain	military supply items	4680.905801217223
6367. as i have repeatedly stated this provision is	much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy	american act	2190.8267207984413
6368. i urge once again that the congress not reenact	this rider	751.3508032605538
6369. the task of providing a reasonable level of military	strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security	is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress	2978.93990347191
6370. the	last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances	in military technology in history	2569.4947321530285
6371. some weapons systems have	become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under	development	1243.5593211216142
6372. furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a	technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often	diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems	3683.6934298115243
6373. this	has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense	program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important	weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems	which have been overtaken by events	4209.991533541348
6374. thus in the last few years a	number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development	was commenced have since been completely eliminated	4076.8061381036086
6375. for example	the importance of the regulus 2 a very promising aerodynamic	ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines	was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more	advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines	4211.7208850036595
6376. another example is the recent cancellation of the f-108	a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed	of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the	period of the mid-1960's	6064.426065803966
6377. the substantial progress being made in ballistic	missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned	bombers to missiles	1880.750729835147
6378. considering the high cost of the f-108	system- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned- and	the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to	stop further work on the project	6064.807337046439
6379. meanwhile other air defense forces	are being made effective as described later in this message	1100.3553208800868
6380. the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from	earlier plans	1403.3877914269626
6381. notable in this category are the jupiter and thor	intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed	produced and deployed but the relative importance of which	has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile	4130.519466383144
6382. the impact of technological factors	is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program	1893.2850987576371
6383. this project was started at a time when there was a critical need for	a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance	aircraft particularly our heavy bombers	3449.9290724288912
6384. continuing technical	problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant	improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious	questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program	5322.12863945799
6385. as	a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed	640.0036176571485
6386. these examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations	of new major development programs and even more penetrating and	far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology	4452.783391156565
6387. the	cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the	greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development	in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in	deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production	or to abandon it	5069.156418751385
6388. the deterrent power	of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability	and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any	form of war	4290.985318919759
6389. the first capability is represented by a combination	of manned bombers carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate	range missiles	1732.7222597793552
6390. the second capability is represented by our	deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together	with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement	4275.238939269234
6391. the strategic air command is the principal element	of our long-range nuclear capability	795.077728039962
6392. one of the important and difficult	decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role	of the b-70 a long-range supersonic bomber	3903.8809851606356
6393. this aircraft which	was planned for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary	to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile	systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier	3646.246484341848
6394. the first atlas icbm's are now operational the first two	polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year	and the first titan icbm's next year	4285.641173191731
6395. the minuteman solid-fueled	icbm is planned to be operational about mid-1963	503.3955461627006
6396. by	1965 several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and	their reliability established	2120.8468946389767
6397. thus the need for the b-70	as a strategic weapon system is doubtful	797.6864358119021

6438. it is agreed that any goods delivered	or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects	within categories a b and c under paragraph 2 above which	may later be approved by the united states will be eligible for financing	from currency granted or loaned to the government of india	7595.342538410281
6439. with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under	article 2 of the agreement the understanding of the government	of the united states of america with respect to both paragraphs 1	local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the government of india	for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1	of article 2 of the agreement upon the presentation of such	the	government of india shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and	records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed	projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 of article	2 of the agreement to disclose the use thereof in the projects	and to record the progress of the projects	0.20124717349522497
6440. the books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained	for the duration of the project or until the expiration of three	years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the united	states whichever is later	6463.694051445969
6441. the two governments shall have the	right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and	all other documents correspondence memoranda and other records involving	transactions relating to agreed projects	3438.7237531678343
6442. the government of india	shall enable the authorized representatives of the united states	to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and	services financed under the projects and shall furnish to the united	states all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning	the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto	7813.75129129119
6443. this broad delegation leaves within our discretion	both the determination	of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the	methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided	3210.081426799296
6444. the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast	band from 540 kc to 1600 kc	1877.4268982904177
6445. whenever two or more standard	broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent	frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of	the other	2728.3109365241216
6446. the extent of such interference- which may be so slight	as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders	a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service	areas of both stations- depends on many factors among the principal	ones being the distance between the stations their respective	radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day	8817.728853154482
6447. other factors playing a part in the the extent of am service	and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position	of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along	the	transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others	4464.599457737092
6448. with the	existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously	has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments	of am stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure	against any interference in any circumstances	6670.749597187963
6449. rather such assignments	are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules	and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to	the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables	and averaging out others	in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection	against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of	stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation	0.20124717349522497
6450. an example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established	for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference	which is regarded as objectionable	4091.697520856537
6451. by this standard it is determined	that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved	objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within	the service area of station b where station a's signal	is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station b's	signal at that point	5187.951431681049
6452. the 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel	interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which	we must always take into account in am assignments and allocations-	that signals from a particular station are potential sources	of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within	which they provide useful service	7406.70710940499
6453. a second fundamental principle	is that involved particularly in the present proceeding- the difference	between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect	to the standard broadcast frequencies	2855.803551100141
6454. this is a phenomenon familiar	to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at	night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere	4684.204780393277
6455. all am stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals	at all hours; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave	radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during	this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference	are in general negligible	4628.30017932923
6456. but during nighttime hours the skywave	radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility	of one station's rendering service via skywave at a much	greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the	same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the	still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference	to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent	frequencies	0.30166232349522504
6457. because of the difference between daytime and nighttime	propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation	structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am	band with many more stations operating during the day than at night	4128.357786343236
6458. it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime	to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous	process but takes place over periods of time from roughly	2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from	roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise	7898.558313305368
6459. during	the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions	are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail; during	the same period around sunrise skywave transmission is declining	until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes	of little practical significance	4819.821904719346
6460. however in this case as elsewhere	it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to	all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to	fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points	between daytime and nighttime conditions	7024.053965442717
6461. it was determined that	the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this	purpose	1411.5797335506531
6462. accordingly the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations	upon the operation of daytime stations	1646.3014794373107
6463. class 2 stations	operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate	under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset	or sunset at the location of the dominant	class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station		3394.6155894186404
6464. the same restrictions apply	after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on	regional channels which after that time are required to operate under	nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other	5616.223623683311
6465. with respect	to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference	is determined by skywave curves	giving average skywave values	2030.3892241842564
6466. these curves were derived	by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data	966.4749941286024
6467. it was recognized	that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great	variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength	2171.314353773121
6468. for this	reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary	in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave	primary service and for both skywave service and skywave	interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of	time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded- 50 percent of	the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference	8575.790550082438
6469. as mentioned the allocation	of am stations represents a balance between protection against	interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number	of stations	2579.8978876572755
6470. the rules and policies to be applied in this process of	course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired	if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation	5733.107572287223
6471. our objectives	to provide some	to provide as many choices of	to provide service	of local origin to as many listeners as possible	2336.8606101655596
6472. since broadcast	frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some	extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and	to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction	of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others	7130.144744945637
6473. accordingly	the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern	for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern	for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use	by different classes of stations	3740.6352130406026
6474. some 45 frequencies are assigned for	use primarily by dominant class 1- a or class 1-	b clear-channel stations designed to operate with adequate	power and to provide service- both groundwave and skywave-	over large areas and at great distances being protected against	interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective	7627.981376892103
6475. in dealing	with these frequencies the objective listed first above- provision	of service to all listeners- was predominant; the other objectives	were subordinated to it	2586.1346998675667
6476. the class 1 stations on these clear	channels are protected to their 0	1184.6228829061704
6477. 1-mvm groundwave contours	against daytime cochannel interference	93.6985515238213
6478. with respect to skywave service	rendered at night class 1- a stations are the only stations	permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified	for class 1- a operation and so render skywave service	free	from cochannel interference whereever they may be received; class	1- b stations are protected at night to their 0	8076.561387634744
6479. 5-mvm	50-percent	time skywave contours against cochannel interference	167.45912222227287
6480. since	the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference	only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service	3046.3029065324317
6481. but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course	entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which	is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it	2841.8872507733204
6482. with	respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local	and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively	stations operating generally with lower power	4831.58484305484
6483. in the allocation	pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range	service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives-	assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations	in as many communities as possible	4136.439020738116
6484. as mentioned the primary	allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations	on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from	destructive interference	4280.974954763242
6485. during nighttime hours because of the intense	skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can	be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area	service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily	by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render	it	5197.37631087519
6486. therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of	these channels no station other than the dominant	station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1- a	station can render service interference free wherever it can be received	6346.121430474306
6487. on the remainder of the clear channels the dominant	stations are protected as described above and the relatively	small number of secondary stations permitted to operate	on these channels at night are required to operate directionally	andor with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations	4836.727874128651
6488. in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively	inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number	of stations on these channels	4282.566880994947
6489. additional class 2 assignments	for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference	to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation	provide additional service on these channels and additional local	outlets for a large number of communities	4463.7589456067935
6490. such additional daytime	class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made	of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large	number of them	5006.459326163932
6491. similarly on the regional channels many class 3	stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate	nighttime with directional antennas andor lower power	2862.6159970046474
6492. essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime	skywave proceeding is whether our decision in 1938-1939 to	assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset	is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light	of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission	is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and	after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and	some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these	hours	0.30166232349522504
6493. the decision	reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount	of data and thorough study thereof	1877.8495301662285
6494. since then there has been a notable	increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional	data and the development of new techniques for using it leading	to a better understanding of propagation phenomena	5908.156368259867
6495. in 1947 affidavits	were filed with the commission by various clear-channel stations	alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service	areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations	whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to	create skywave intereference	4749.817169790518
6496. if you elect to use the standard deduction or the tax table and	later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by	filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim	for refund	6317.08672402709
6497. see you may claim a refund page 135	167.3749397239452
6498. the same	is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should	have used the standard deduction or tax table	3480.474866010213
6499. the words amended	return should be plainly written across the top of such return	934.7338948093038
6500. april 15 is usually the final date	for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar	year ending on december 31	3885.208399378475
6501. if you use a fiscal year a year ending	on the last day of any month other than december your return is	due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your	tax year	4234.374407510426
6502. if the last day	for performing act for tax purposes such as filing a	return or making a tax payment etc falls on saturday sunday	or a legal holiday you may perform that act on the next succeeding day	which is not a saturday sunday or legal holiday	7252.827377026842

6580. the one- or two-season hunt of which there have been too many recently	may do more harm than good; for such programs raise hopes of assistance	toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which	are dashed when the programs are discontinued; and they are dashed	no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development	toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit	0.30166232349522504
6581. for	the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any	foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments	of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good: such judgments	can be known to be good only by the records of those selected	by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods	of time	5562.009583516479
6582. the central group of the foundation's advisors	are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board	consisting now of thirty-six men and women	4278.169925383129
6583. they are chosen by the	foundation's board of trustees on the bases of their own first-rate	accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts	2738.234972729106
6584. their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations	in the several kinds of educational and research institutions	that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths	also are factors in the trustees' minds	6203.929071240111
6585. for this concept of an	advisory board ancillary to the board of trustees we are indebted	to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell	a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions	and their administration	4235.750429657606
6586. that we had the wit and wisdom to adopt mr	lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection	is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly	pretty uniformly good	6042.617691057037
6587. for in accordance with mr lowell's	concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced	selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes	and our choices	3225.9479261766537
6588. and lest we should become too consistent in the	sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points	of view in the arts the foundation's board of trustees maintains	a trickle- not a flow!- of new members through the advisory board	6801.452100600269
6589. two committees of members of the advisory board constitute	the committees of selection- one for the selection of fellows	from canada the united states and the english-speaking caribbean	area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american	republics and the republic of the philippines	4770.260622089436
6590. to the members	of our advisory board and most specially to its members who constitute	our committees of selection the foundation is indebted for its	successes of choice of fellows	4809.9190784639995
6591. we are as we know utterly dependent	on the quality of advice we get; and quality of advice added to	devotion to the foundation's purposes and ideals we do get from	our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated	only by those of us who work here every day	5128.1130590211
6592. but the facts about	our advisory board and its members' duties are only one of several	sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative	on which to base our selections of fellows	5792.0889061418075
6593. for example the	interest of past members of the foundation's advisory board remains	such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal	much as they had done when they were formally members of that board	3943.795654847991
6594. and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers	of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants	of government and men of affairs- hundreds indeed- who serve	the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis	out of their experience	6869.405510333769
6595. to all the foundation gives the kind	of thanks which are more than thanks: to them we are grateful beyond	the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are	3208.736745403353
6596. it is a truism of business that no business can be better than	its board of directors and its top management	3036.8304060135515
6597. the same is true of	every foundation	93.7447085869965
6598. during the biennium reviewed in this report our	board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the	board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class	administration of the foundation's affairs:   dr	james brown fisk physicist president of the bell telephone laboratories	was elected to the board of trustees	8033.851169398925
6599. he is a member	both of the national academy of sciences and of the american philosophical	society; and he has served our country well as a scientific	statesman on international commissions	3340.9488222142077
6600. dr gordon n	ray provost vice-president and professor of english in the university	of illinois was appointed associate secretary general	2817.756188749888
6601. the trustees of the foundation appointed dr ray to that position	with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present secretary	general upon the latter's eventual retirement	2982.737645642012
6602. dr ray is	a fellow of the foundation- appointed thrice to assist his studies	of william makepeace thackeray and of h g wells- and	before his appointment to the foundation's executive staff had been	given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the advisory board	6853.4382574777555
6603. referring further to the foundation's officers dr	james f mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as	associate secretary was promoted to be secretary	2459.5300293813702
6604. he is a historian	with the great merit of a historian's long view	1185.0151382214824
6605. also appointed	to the foundation's staff as assistant secretary is mr	j kellum smith jr	1110.0026562947542
6606. mr smith like the present secretary	general is a lawyer; and lawyers- with the great virtues	that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are	able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions	to difficult problems in many fields- are indispensable even in a foundation	office	7550.603387579575
6607. the present secretary general has been the	foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the	foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago	1746.7943596827354
6608. but even he will	not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are quite	simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the foundation's	policies and practices	4117.052910896004
6609. the effective recognition of excellence and	its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even	in a year	2472.673264728305
6610. we are not given to lamentations neither personally	nor in these reports	963.0553228566808
6611. on the contrary if this be an apocalyptic	era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity	2034.5725387796242
6612. for	granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved these	problems make great demands; and by their demanding tend to create	resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers	do not bring forth	6061.137771238326
6613. of this examples are legion: pericles speaking	his funeral oration in ancient greece's extremity after thermopylae	and making it a testament of freedom; jefferson writing the	declaration of independence amid the catastrophes of revolution;	christ preaching the sermon on the mount close to his ultimate sacrifice;	shakespeare speaking with the indescribable gusto of the	elizabethan voice- keats's words- in the days of the spanish	armada's threats; isaac newton at the age of twenty-three	industriously calculating logarithms to two and fifty places during	the great plague year in england 1665; winston churchill's	olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when britain stood alone	against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago; the	present-day explorations of outer space answering age-old questions	of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of extinction	0.20124717349522497
6614. forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the roman poet	virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers	of today	3283.3850136814704
6615. it gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many	catastrophes of the past produced; and it is to be noted also that	confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared	in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind	4666.576269346571
6616. for example out of the social evils of the english industrial	revolution came the novels of charles dickens; and his genius	moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all western men-	until today- in the industrialized west these social evils	substantially do not exist	7130.793752082929
6617. the solutions were not arrived at by any	theoreticians of the karl marx stripe but by men of government- lawyers	most of them- and men of business	2836.898303060038
6618. these were educated men	who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions	out of experience under the burden of responsibility	3645.0344100769457
6619. that is	to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit	or they had to get the votes to get elected	2590.651415459584
6620. nevertheless they made	naught of marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers-	to use marx's word- more than a subsistence wage with	the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its	way into the capitalists' pockets with the result in turn that the	gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery	of the poor increase	8423.051655463098
6621. but as all understand who have eyes	to see nothing of the kind has happened; indeed the contrary has	happened	1881.6975385785693
6622. the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed	in the industrialized western world to the point that the word	poor is hardly applicable	3903.4884150355647
6623. and the reason this could happen is	clear: men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned	themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their	concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of	freedom and opportunity	4600.26002606752
6624. some would say that they were not permitted	to run their businesses only for profit; and even putting it that	way would not prove that marx was anything but wrong	4806.516010152347
6625. sir henry	sumner maine a hundred years before communism was a force to be	reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that the	progress of society is from status to contract	3345.5910788644164
6626. the essence of contract	is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not	do	3063.9325158247475
6627. hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice	501.7560340629428
6628. the greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater	the range of choice; the greater the range of choice the greater	the rate of change	4260.543216572841
6629. for change is dependent on the possibilities that	individual men glimpse for the future	944.1216320650635
6630. but when there is not freedom	and opportunity to choose men- individual men- must remain in status	and society does not cannot progress	3481.238004083227
6631. the eternal truth	is that progress- due as it always is to individual creative genius-	is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the	beating of the heart	3458.758019287022
6632. and lest anybody think that considerations	such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten	them with the truths that under communism there would have been	no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would	not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed	untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative	efforts for the good of mankind	8794.759583088497
6633. during the year 1959	we granted 354 fellowships; in 1960 we granted 334	787.5380624207938
6634. as heretofore	our fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of	knowledge and creative effort in all the arts	3028.4996955384217
6635. we do not favor one field	over another: we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic	creation is good- provided only that it contributes to a sense	and understanding of the true ends of life as all first-rate scholarship	and artistic creation does	4539.5779065129955
6636. indeed if pressed we would say what	the late robert henri american painter said to a pupil anything	will do for a subject: it's what you do with it that counts	5016.477288940421
6637. thus we have no part and want none in current discussions	of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities	the creative arts	2581.7078024544403
6638. we want no part in such discussions because	we think them largely futile; and we think them largely futile because	for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every	artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of	view	6447.429377954731
6639. when the brown + sharpe manufacturing company reached its	125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 it became an almost	unique institution in the mechanical world	2023.6149174271873
6640. with its history	standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution	brown + sharpe has become over the years a singular monument	to the mechanical foresight of its founder joseph r brown and	a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology	5555.75564479979
6641. joseph r brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise	of new england between 1810 and 1830	1404.8128254208286
6642. he was early exposed to	the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father david	brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade	4277.163055194337
6643. at the	age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott +	harris in valley falls rhode island and following two or three	other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business	for himself in 1831 making lathes and small tools	3791.668826783088
6644. this enterprise	led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 under the name	d brown + son a business which eventually grew into the modern	corporation we now call brown + sharpe	2647.9648213816477
6645. the years of joseph's	partnership with his father were numbered	370.6105101214128
6646. in 1838 a devastating	fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved	west to illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years	4285.780280286747
6647. joseph brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding	the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those	first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the	standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world	4544.996188790872
6648. much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with	clock movements	1183.2198386231705
6649. during these early years the repair of watches and	clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed	an important part of the young man's occupation	2990.5117189138755
6650. he became particularly	interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's	and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during	this period	3479.9807555854013
6651. but his business also grew and we are told that mr	brown found it	increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his	creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire	3433.8827967172974
6652. it must have	been with some pleasure and relief that on september 12 1848 joseph	brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically	cryptic style lucian sharpe came to work for me this day	as an apprentice	6447.750542993485
6653. the young apprentice apparently did well	by mr brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship lucian	was offered a full partnership in the firm; the company became j	r brown + sharpe and entered into a new and important	period of its development	3618.9017585572337
6654. mr sharpe's arrival in the business	did indeed provide what mr brown had most coveted- time for tinkering	and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those	developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that	time	6312.769993400174
6655. by 1853 the new partnership announced the precision	vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts	1573.8893208994548
6656. the basic	significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855	by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing	engine	4043.566158560746
6657. that development in turn formed the foundation of still more	significant expansions in later years- in gear cutting in circular	graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy	was a paramount requirement	3744.5600584178255
6658. throughout their careers both	mr brown and mr sharpe were interested in the problem of setting	up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades	3686.9280311373977
6659. several	efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive	to this day the brown + sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted	as the american standard and is still in common use today	3022.993406214736
6660. as one development followed another the company's reputation for	precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities	for expansion in precision manufacture	3871.438423720443
6661. in 1858 the partnership	began manufacturing the willcox + gibbs sewing machine	261.66916869023663
6662. as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back	counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a	magazine of the famous howe sewing machine	4843.089986400924
6663. curious as to what made	it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel	until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling	the crude machine to take stitches	4208.983211728131
6664. when he showed this model as his	solution as to how the howe sewing machine operated he was	told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the howe	machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while	the one that he had perfected used only one	7545.15819107712
6665. thus was invented the	single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with	mr willcox decided to bring to brown + sharpe with the proposal	that the small company undertake its manufacture	2561.3439051837086
6666. the new work	was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly	for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r	brown toward yet further developments for production equipment	5779.442411323599
6667. the turret screw machine now known as the brown + sharpe hand	screw machine takes its ancestry directly from mr brown's efforts	to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing	machine	2579.010253241113
6668. mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine	design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret	by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible	tap and die holders	5627.471666955677
6669. in 1861 mr brown's attention	was called to yet another basic production problem- the manufacture	of twist drills	1570.8931751259631
6670. at that time during the civil war union muskets	were being manufactured in providence and the drills to drill them	were being hand-filed with rattail files	4080.394313863042
6671. this process neither satisfied	the urgent production schedules nor mr brown's imagination	of the possibilities in the situation	1581.1158842509126
6672. the child of this problem was	mr brown's famous serial no 1 universal milling machine	the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type	milling machine used throughout the world	4874.467833261004
6673. the original machine bearing	its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the brown + sharpe	precision center in providence	1209.394936939816
6674. during the civil war	period mr brown also invented the brown + sharpe formed tooth	gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's	gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics	3828.5884882964224
6675. up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear	teeth but they were good for only one sharpening	2313.986202472646
6676. as soon as the	time came for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost	and a new cutter had to be made	3896.745783306074
6677. this process made the economical	manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit	the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss	of the precision form	3329.3591037804777
6678. mr brown's invention achieved this and	as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown + sharpe's position	of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until	the 1920's when superceded by other methods	4133.226076522381
6679. the micrometer	caliper as a common workshop tool also owes much to j r brown	1102.5305297519956
6680. although mr brown was not himself its inventor	it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance	of mass producing this basic tool for general use	4253.909550780762
6681. so it was	that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool	on exhibition in paris in 1868 they brought a sample with them to the	united states and started brown + sharpe in yet another field where	it retains its leadership to this day	3841.9544619035087
6682. the final achievement	of mr brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a	close second in importance to his development of the universal milling	machine	3894.0623193799997
6683. that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding	machine which made its appearance in 1876 at the philadelphia centennial	exposition	2025.0753098375178
6684. this machine like its milling counterpart was	the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision	metalworking shops throughout the world	3701.597943289803
6685. along with j r brown's	other major developments the universal grinding machine was profoundly	influential in setting the course of brown + sharpe for many	years to come	2033.353799546709
6686. following mr brown's death there came	forward in the brown + sharpe organization many other men who contributed	greatly to the development of the company	2522.53177450273
6687. one such man was samuel	darling	43.60755666566038
6688. as head of the firm darling + swartz mr	darling began by challenging brown + sharpe to its keenest competition	during the 1850's and early 60's	1792.8075597424152
6689. in 1868 however a truce	was called between the companies and the partnership of darling brown	+ sharpe was formed	1096.0881987996947
6690. between that year and the buying out of mr	darling's interest in 1892 a large portion of the company's precision	tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown	+ sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still	bearing that famous trademark	5866.373138129829
6691. perhaps the outstanding standard	bearer of mr brown's tradition for accuracy was mr oscar	j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of	mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly	accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown + sharpe	to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding	anything then available elsewhere in the world	4666.771263445113
6692. also important	on the brown + sharpe scene at the turn of the century was	mr richmond viall works superintendent of the company from	1876 to 1910	2878.5384587981553
6693. mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership	and development of men	641.0725029546109
6694. he was an ardent champion of the brown	+ sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able	men who first developed their industrial talents with the company	3039.603633762806
6695. in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown + sharpe	products over the years has been the men who began work with the	company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout	the nation and even abroad	3559.6989739610717
6696. commencing with the death of	lucian sharpe in 1899 the name of henry d sharpe was for more	than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company	4654.592398932923
6697. during	his presidency the company's physical plant was enormously expanded	and the length and breadth of the brown + sharpe machine tool	line became the greatest in the world	2149.7837248361348
6698. during the early part of this	century the brown + sharpe works in providence were unchallenged	as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to	precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world	3987.143108218444
6699. during these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets	laid down by mr brown	1260.5041355292444
6700. it expanded from hand screw machines	to automatic screw machines from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines	to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing	business from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to	a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type	milling machines	7003.276073276798
6701. in the grinding machine field expansion went far	from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface	grinders and a wide variety of special and semi-special models	2992.105339386496
6702. in 1951 henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and	continued	the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working	equipment business	3476.3069484230014
6703. the company is still broadening its line and	is now active on four major fronts	1099.0640248628029
6704. the machine tool division	is currently producing brown + sharpe single spindle automatic screw	machines grinding machines of many types and knee and bed-type	milling machines	2705.195872852023
6705. recently added is the brown + sharpe turret drilling	machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool	development	1333.288230666221
6706. in the industrial products division the company	manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection	equipment machinists' tools- including micrometers vernier	calipers and accessories	4265.481374164817
6707. in the cutting tool division	the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling	cutters end mills and saws	2189.995526648666
6708. sales and net income for the year ended december 31 1960 showed an	improvement over 1959	1895.8380828188215
6709. net income was $2557111 or $3	43.85408313750396
6710. 11 per share	on 821220 common shares currently outstanding as compared to $2323867	or $2	1646.4689025132484
6711. 82 per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares	637.7631655839302
6712. sales and other operating income increased 25	141.3745933559194
6713. 1% from $24926615	in 1959 to $31179816 in 1960	260.43805350540896
6714. this increase was sufficient to	overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and	increased expenditures on research and development	3476.2111258428945
6715. in spite	of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected	substantially by the current decline in business activity we have	been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960	at a rate materially higher than during 1959	4540.85905104248
6716. year	our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and	unless this trend can be reversed our production for 1961 will be lower	than for 1960	4273.579473326297
6717. however the healthy inventory position of	the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that	improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961	3207.9825746468105
6718. in connection with our continuing	development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u	s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling	the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic	basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesona's	business in the next few years	7893.36231948868
6719. such a depreciation policy would	also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the	competitive position of the u s textile and other industries	thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange	4054.564203111203
6720. our research and development program	serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost	production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis	at leesona	4303.075108574237
6721. this program is based on the policy of designing	and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile	values- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility	provide the consumer with better textile products for the money	4212.481524941425
6722. such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing	mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility	2114.30830365133
6723. but more important	we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely	new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and	our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine	3452.685068166483
6724. on this basis our already substantial budget for research and	development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance	the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesona's	future growth in sales and earnings	5926.75406016606
6725. much of this necessary	increase in research and development though properly chargeable to	current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed	and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of	several years	4035.8680627537688
6726. in december we began to	ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines	749.2061653452928
6727. these machines produce	the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured	fabrics	1097.7338736052902
6728. during the past year great progress has been made by	the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics	2831.9373357170507
6729. fashion	centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and	improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics	2192.8963746912264
6730. this machine operating at speeds up to 350000 revolutions	per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations	in industry today	3699.6140893681672
6731. it transfers yarn directly from the producers'	largest package into ideal supply packages for use on unifil loom	winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics	2468.575000214808
6732. our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing	well in our customers' mills	1878.2779378131804
6733. later in the year additional types	of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other	man-made fibers and natural yarns	2319.735242321912
6734. these machines are designed to provide	higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility	of application to different types of yarn	3250.536155852171
6735. this we believe will	substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment	641.8409199788955
6736. major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled	completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic	coning machine	3040.1553375547905
6737. this work is progressing on schedule and we expect to	make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year	1873.6944270317058
6738. this machine	was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and	was well received by the industry	2359.1871177883922
6739. the potential market for the machine	should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder	1259.671681101002
6740. the	uniconer has several outstanding features- it operates with much	greater efficiency than existing equipment; it incorporates an automatic	knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in	the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end	is exhausted	7335.069467428804
6741. because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a	relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation	provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile	production at the same time upgrading quality	3661.36775456712
6742. many mills have already	placed firm orders for this machine	562.5589650289796
6743. a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling	for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment	2029.7003169677387
6744. machines	a new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate	the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic	yarns	3483.2666228014714
6745. it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to	hold precise tension and speed	1255.407788694278
6746. this new machine takes up filament	yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds	up to 6000 feet per minute	3479.9846848324864
6747. it is equipped with an automatic threading	device to reduce waste and handling time	940.8979003714725
6748. our take-up machines	and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing	for application with new high polymer yarns in several fiber producing	plants	3693.0672061643827
6749. we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding	field	499.5180073634783
6750. we are interested in further diversification	into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial	products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction	4102.3374073038985
6751. our patterson moos research	division has made further very encouraging progress in development of	fuel cells	1265.411758426373
6752. the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt	+ whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation	has been important in this work	1997.7511066345862
6753. in addition to its major effort on fuel	cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry	on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department	other government agencies and for our own account	3971.586681934788
6754. pmr	is currently supplying components vital to the titan and minuteman	programs	951.8982796812445
6755. we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie	generale de telegraphie sans fil of france for	the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials	2724.966893293421
6756. the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing	of such materials in the united states	1878.7761417887182
6757. initially we will import the	thermoelectric materials and modules from france but later we will	manufacture in this country	1726.6829101145668
6758. there is a rapidly growing demand for this	material primarily from the military	1183.5010025604329
6759. further research we believe	will develop important commercial applications	260.12899883010283
6760. a project for	the air force has been completed in which the nair infrared	detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous	gases	4089.8367344693456
6761. we are initiating research on the use of solid state	materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require	cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity	2997.2537694413736
6762. the rapid	advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation	961.7258347176703
6763. our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development	those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities	2322.192387501648
6764. early in august we broke ground	for a new $3500000 plant in warwick rhode island which will house	our textile and coil winding machinery operations	3893.0144774353494
6765. construction is	well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of	this year	1255.7102518087781
6766. all operations now carried on at our plant at cranston will	be transferred to warwick	1645.1852328959717
6767. operations in the new plant should be	producing efficiently early in 1962	640.7148912264397
6768. an architect's sketch	of the new plant is shown on the front cover	1190.2275229083866
6769. the building will contain	430000 square feet approximately the same as our present plant	945.691133227124
6770. however	its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production	capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially	reduce current repair and maintenance costs	3693.3074548996324
6771. a major consideration	in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was	the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly	skilled work force	3229.0427006473346
6772. we have entered into an agreement for the	sale of the present cranston properties effective as soon as we have	completed removal to our new plant	4111.739557823438
6773. during	the year our british subsidiary leesona-holt limited expanded	its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity	1741.2051415502544
6774. the	operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesona's former operations	in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant	in the adjoining town of heywood	4288.545200493181
6775. layout and equipment were modernized	and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis	1100.8604129885139
6776. the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size	of the former rochdale and manchester locations	2350.2148033761523
6777. in addition land	has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future	1417.1167192733894

6891. week-end activities for the entire	campus are planned by the co-op board	643.5575321741874
6892. in recent months much attention has been given to the probable	extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat	divided as to the outlook for the near future	4990.128117886442
6893. and yet despite some	disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new	decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures	of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole	4309.516115875311
6894. the	shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the	present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has	prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized	many previous swings in the business cycle	6792.541557372407
6895. this caution	has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors	to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact	stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because	of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level	4749.617241571042
6896. in	the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories	of tv sets	1400.5934990739656
6897. factory stocks in recent months have been the	highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below	1959	2167.835193505581
6898. the total value of our industry's shipments at factory prices	increased from $9	1180.8648210342499
6899. 2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10	94.00708100883837
6900. 1 billion	as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business-	home entertainment military industrial and replacement	3263.495290905735
6901. i believe	a further gain is in prospect for 1961	372.0774808412326
6902. up	reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as	consoles and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment	electronics in 1960 was about $1	4088.886163525321
6903. 9 billion compared to $1	14.818027945593306
6904. sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months	of 1959 through july; set production	also ran ahead in the early months but was curtailed	after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence	that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic	7431.793113440115
6905. for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came	to 5	1100.9892951079103
6906. 7 million in 1959; however production came	to only 5	563.4178047286224
6907. 6 million compared to 6	14.868607268416605
6908. in contrast to the	lower turnout of tv total radio production increased from 15	1413.653442082907
6909. 4	million sets to 16	14.718631939706345
6910. both home and auto	radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead	of 1959 in every month of the first eleven; sales and production of	home sets were about equal at 10	5762.0873305846535
6911. auto set production	came to about 6	94.58800957225574
6912. 3 million compared to 5	22.09063380708313
6913. separate	phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of	stereo	sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade	that characterized the radio-tv market	3338.4480222018065
6914. the outlook	for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present	but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers	to step up their buying plans for durable goods	5645.435729656269
6915. i would expect that	sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some	10-15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison	with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business	conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will	5015.045921609942
6916. i	look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at 5	1177.675605862609
6917. 7	million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from	the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15	2989.6469959262313
6918. i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop	in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1	3275.8937315266444
6919. 8	million slightly below 1960 but above 1959	166.97068337097198
6920. to grow	1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's	shipments of military electronics which totalled about $5	2345.4884337943836
6921. 4 billion	compared to $4	14.749803864678768
6922. it is interesting to note that	the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than	the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 which were good	years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period	of rapid consumer acceptance	6535.673593096636
6923. it has been correctly pointed out by well-informed	people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to	expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized	the decade of the 1950's and that our military markets	may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons	systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas	of our defense capability	5852.272996372501
6924. while this may well be true in general i	believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments	suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be	one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding	rapidly in other directions	7588.580717487486
6925. among the items scheduled	for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b70	programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic	air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems	3444.1675205682413
6926. research	and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite	samos and the future development of ballistic missile	defense systems such as nike-zeus are expected to increase substantially	4262.281942135317
6927. research development test and evaluation funds devoted	to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft	and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement	by 1963	3755.225139670564
6928. still later the realm of space technology will show	substantial gains; it has been estimated that spending by the national	aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than	$500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 and that	the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer	to 50% than the current 20%	8195.60393789744
6929. the stepped up defense procurement	called for in the 1961 budget has already begun to make itself	felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and	the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional	$2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested	for fiscal 1962	5230.04367169553
6930. although the impact of these increases on our industry's	shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good	increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $6 billion	5160.875049618522
6931. electronic equipment	paced by the continuing rapid growth	of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic	equipment totalled $1	2021.7763811686007
6932. 8 billion compared to $1	22.211694515008496
6933. the market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand	at the rate of about 30% annually reaching some $450 million in	1960	2323.5828753339692
6934. informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple	by the late 1960's under the stimulus of new applications in	the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information	storage and retrieval	5472.314508809529
6935. in the industrial field prospects	for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment	are also quite bright	1576.1424404276627
6936. for the near term however it must be realized	that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive	to general business conditions than is the military market and for this	reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller	than those of recent years; sales should slightly exceed 1960 however	and reach $1	8097.04112395357
6937. in addition to	the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business	the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues	year by year	2731.160331021886
6938. this is now a $1	22.43020428711405
6939. 0 billion business up from $0	43.85805472005684
6940. 9 billion	in 1959 and should reach $1	253.0099759231116
6941. the markets	for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of	the various end equipment segments of the industry	2022.5184094902356
6942. demand for parts	for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were	cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced	their own operating rates	5000.522336050004
6943. in the military field incoming orders turned	down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall	when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt	in rising orders for components	3843.776931429899
6944. sales of transistors in 1960	exceeded $300 million compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial	price reductions in virtually all types	3257.225189912582
6945. production totalled about	123 million units against 82 million in 1959 and i look for a further	gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961	2985.633411348693
6946. sales of passive components such as capacitors and resistors although	not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of	1959 this year and should increase again in 1961	4814.708737612513
6947. in sum i	look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with	total sales increasing about 7% to $10	2177.3647526755954
6948. 8 billion despite the uncertainties	in the business outlook generally	565.1658489367405
6949. as i have indicated above	i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market	for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of	the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on	to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects	for continued increases in defense spending; and on continued growth	in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing	and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's	0.20124717349522497
6950. the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager	of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading	manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical	controls has been announced by david b peck vice president	special products	6075.416518321084

6958. mr devey is a member of the institute	of radio engineers and is chairman of the electronic industries association	committee p-9 on printed and modular components	4116.098328862718
6959. mr brown well-known english-born inventor prior to founding	vectrol was at various times section leader in radio research at	metropolitan vickers electrical co ltd; chief engineer	of the radio set division of electric and musical industries ltd	the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in great britain;	director of engineering at philco of great britain ltd and	vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president	at the brush development co cleveland ohio	0.20124717349522497
6960. he has a bachelor	of science from the university of manchester england	962.3052736181944
6961. mr	brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923	946.5809472785219
6962. he is a fellow of the american institute of electrical engineers	and a senior member of the institute of radio engineers	3059.5551493073103

6964. the promotion of robert e swift to the position of assistant	manager of the interference control field service department	was announced early in december by frederick s scarborough	manager of interference control field service	5434.992468361497
6965. the appointment was	made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers	of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability	problems	2591.8671107736
6966. between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters	751.442956012306
6967. since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential	aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both	jobs	2195.990928723809
6968. since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals	rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is	proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing	in the decisions that govern its course	6043.71034102895
6969. the faculty	believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching	and scholarship	1251.322707975852
6970. the president expects faculty members to remember	in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility	for the university's income nor are they personally accountable	for top-level decisions	4632.114111078846
6971. he may welcome their appropriate participation	in the determination of high policy but he has a right to	expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the	administration	3209.2172922580567
6972. how well do faculty members govern themselves	140.8203736045644
6973. there is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought	to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in	government	2715.4809231774207
6974. they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than	to their own internal problems of government	1883.3379024014557
6975. they too need to learn	to delegate	93.78048174326219
6976. letting the administration take details off their hands	would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a	whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention	4835.649125538457
6977. although	faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige	to a member who actively participates in college or university	government	2023.166332085352
6978. there are nevertheless several things that the president	can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those	who are willing to exercise their privilege	4294.852171882063
6979. he can for example	present significant university-wide issues to the senate	500.58128657914074
6980. he can encourage	quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to	it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as	well as the action-oriented faculty; by making certain that no faculty	member has too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison	between the committees and the administration; by minimizing the	number of committees	8122.36127891004
6981. despite the many avenues for the exchange	of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack	of communication persist	1891.821170669668
6982. the cause is as often neglect as hesitance	to disclose	566.7575606587628
6983. a busy president conversant with a problem and its ramifications	and beset by pressures to meet deadlines tends naturally to	assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is	3575.707326430079
6984. the	need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all	methods of consultation	1872.6281652468922
6985. to increase faculty influence and decrease	tension many presidents have established a standing advisory	committee with which they can discuss problems frankly	2185.6449353379585
6986. the president	has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes but if	he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw	out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can	also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take	7543.173495466549
6987. success	will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and	persistence	498.8272152033751
6988. the critical task for every president and his	academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university	continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance	will match changing social demands h great professors do not automatically	reproduce themselves	6500.6869351954565
6989. deans can form an important bridge	between the president and the faculty	642.8093922212895
6990. they serve not only as spokesmen	for their areas but they also contribute to top-level decision	making	2115.0124712045254
6991. the president who appoints strong men who have an all-college	or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration	can count on useful assistance	2874.542681932139
6992. faculty members depend on	their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration	1418.5968701848592
6993. the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen	for strategic aid in building stronger departments	1416.8035119122567
6994. one way that this	can be done other than by hiring new high-priced professors is by constantly	encouraging the department members to raise their standards	of performance	4291.371422064614
6995. the quality of a president's leadership is	measured first by his success in building up the faculty	1419.6836895592683
6996. by supporting	the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever	higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership	3486.194370494094
6997. indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for	appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to	2177.488663911561
6998. the academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty	development	962.552897706516
6999. an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel	needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job	and bright prospects elsewhere	2734.6477816446773
7000. for the maintenance of a long-term	program the departments and particularly their chairmen are	strategic	1658.8343131044999
7001. they evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and	promotion	262.6587060447953
7002. to provide an independent judgment for the president the	academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly	1659.7617567836965
7003. at some	colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports	to the administration on the qualifications of candidates	1739.4249788807429
7004. some faculty	members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because	they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma	2836.302873775254
7005. they	can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates	and devote substantial time to the work	1890.2642981788038
7006. at one university	the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner	of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the	faculty	4122.2716640331655
7007. before the president recommends a candidate to the	trustees the administration collects the views of colleagues in the	same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere	2742.312951624338
7008. the president or dean	reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation	of the quality of his mind	3037.8782255449282
7009. no good way to evaluate teaching ability	has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets	for a list of criteria	2176.1223631992807
7010. to avoid passing over quiet unaggressive	teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review	of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should	be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for	advancement by their departments	6810.979131271924
7011. there are certain aspects of	personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly	1090.5215757621877
7012. he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member	proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly	serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements	5000.368551906939
7013. no one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older	men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to	their specialties is quite different	2990.2964650857334
7014. in particular the president	may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members	to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale	4088.9816431924364
7015. on	those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the	standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate	burden of decision and action	3221.1879762231965
7016. a true university like most	successful marriages is a unity of diversities h without forcing	all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan	is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest	level which a university- in contrast to a multiversity- should	stand for	7450.240270377295
7017. recently colleges and universities have begun	to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals	941.6738943521639
7018. each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as:	shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core	for all undergraduates	3901.3371983391467
7019. or shall we permit early specialization in	scientific and technological subjects	501.5032519631935
7020. in the first instance adequate	appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be	planned	1416.395768742228
7021. in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required	505.47436778699483
7022. for the president a master plan looking ahead five years	offers several practical	advantages	1424.1225544626711
7023. trustees faculty and administration can consider the	consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards	1418.60374648518
7024. physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed	249.01640701045898
7025. proposed	new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present	and future financial fitness	1414.1281325415262
7026. more than one president has found	that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts	1894.6798608066915
7027. it inspires	confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and	to achieve them	930.8360869181848
7028. before deciding where it is going however	a college	or university must know where it is	1893.477047444274
7029. the first step is a comprehensive	self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination	of the two	2045.1299888213302
7030. it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization	buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in	stature and size	2595.8618597799727
7031. implementation of the master plan will inevitably	be uneven	262.694066494339
7032. some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically;	others may drag their feet	1176.7923014619582
7033. funds may be readily donated	for some purposes but not others	501.6960446174106
7034. a plan must therefore be brought	up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent	planning officer	2599.059197560089
7035. to provide the continuous flow of information	basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established	offices of institutional research	2019.908426471494
7036. some offices have very broad	responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a university's	instructional program	1882.8139574864513
7037. their duties include evaluation of the information	collected and preparation of recommendations	640.0902401202601
7038. more often these	offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data	955.8605658805885
7039. h the president's opportunity for influencing education reaches	its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which	he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts	3339.3840595077554
7040. no matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget	making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents	3253.000373720807
7041. when	the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget	to which his faith and credit are committed; its principal features	should be a product of his most considered judgment	3559.104158324237
7042. he cannot	of course examine each proposal from scratch	396.51203693723716
7043. he reviews and shapes	the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote	the aims of the institution	2330.7917441489712
7044. budgeting must be flexible to	allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological	scholarship	1888.3238319653424
7045. because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly	large sums of money an institution should choose its fields	of prominence	1730.130630505801
7046. otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst	and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and	culturally indispensable branches of learning	4099.89176814681
7047. in the national interest	even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor	among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses	in all branches	3221.848867287068
7048. supporting activities- business	management public relations fund-raising- offer presidents one of	their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education h here	the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much	to free a president for his primary role	6603.234528718169
7049. in the areas that	do	not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will	serve the college or university better than close presidential attention	2618.328965560423
7050. the president should find strong subordinates and delegate the	widest discretion to them	1175.1515886958132
7051. higher education cannot compete with the	salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can	offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business	community that will offset the differences in income	3774.414239496315
7052. just as	the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy	and objectives so should non-academic officers	2146.0626625486075
7053. they will better	understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program	and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of	mutual goals	3090.925191542843
7054. a president is frequently besieged to serve in	non-academic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay	groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus	4624.108294643473
7055. since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed	by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations	2464.5114771698
7056. declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains	why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance	2355.5017740358953
7057. by sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues	the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to	create a public perception of the university as an institution something	more than the lengthened shadow of one man	4380.083117438872
7058. it has recently become practical to use the	radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information	about these bodies and their atmospheres	4299.798406502107
7059. the results of present observations	of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with	the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived	from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses		3055.508971226753
7060. when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements	are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal	and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials	of the moon	4839.464873140508
7061. observations of the radio emission of a planet	which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater	extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases	give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics	of the solid surface	4496.005460797087
7062. radio observations of venus and jupiter have	already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions	of these planets	2604.444162989321
7063. the observed intensity of the radio emission of	venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity although the	spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and	1o cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo` k	4466.667476898054
7064. this result	suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet	although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be	a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the	observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence	7153.224260409181
7065. for	the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like	the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seems very likely that	the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation	from the atmosphere and non-thermal components	4407.658081869076
7066. of the remaining	planets only mars and saturn have been observed as radio sources	and not very much information is available	3057.427220153575
7067. mars has been observed	twice at about 3-cm wave length and the intensity of the observed	radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which	might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of mars	4051.061929397162
7068. the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observations	but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal	origin	3715.8190947310677
7069. no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining	planets have been reported and because of their distances small	diameters or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths	reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very	low intensity	4643.30661717656
7070. in spite of this the very large radio reflectors and	improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should	make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets	in a few years	5777.27767432362
7071. the study of the radio emission of the moon	and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon	at 1	2469.4176221988823
7072. 25-cm wave length by dicke and beringer	140.76923283194688
7073. this was	followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1	642.2460568400106
7074. 25-cm	emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by piddington and minnett		657.4251196436041
7075. they deduced from their measurements that the radio emission	from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly	sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably	less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission	as measured by pettit and nicholson;	and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-12 days after	full	moon which is again in contrast to the infrared emission which reaches	its maximum at full moon	0.20124717349522497
7076. piddington and minnett explained	their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely	to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent	to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation	5633.300431920121
7077. the infrared	emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon	while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface	where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced	in amplitude and shifted in phase	4393.596510316843
7078. since the absorption of radio waves	in rocklike material varies with wave length it should be possible	to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface	and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the	lunar surface material	6565.573457361401
7079. the radio emission of a planet was	first detected in 1955 when burke and franklin identified the	origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15	meters wave length as emission from jupiter	3771.724436302308
7080. this sporadic type of	planetary radiation is discussed by burke and gallet		515.8005285725089
7081. steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was	observed from venus at 3	949.1433964858588
7082. 4 cm and from mars and jupiter	at 3	395.07502419092145
7083. 15 cm in 1956	and from saturn at 3	262.47676656144444
7084. 75 cm in 1957		2.595470947486615
7085. in the relatively short time since these early observations	venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from	0	2184.7100493909793
7086. 2 cm and jupiter has been observed over the wave-length	range from 3	1189.2861878107
7087. the observable characteristics of	planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the	direction of arrival of the waves	1892.3171123965562
7088. the maximum angular diameter of	any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc	2596.0201988910567
7089. this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very	large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission	of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved	3335.884428448803
7090. it should	be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio	sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers	3685.39427452175
7091. measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity	and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the	planetary radiation at the earth	2603.975240095858
7092. there have been few measurements specifically	for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation	1646.6632298998193
7093. the measurements made with the nrl 50-foot reflector	which is altitude-azimuth-mounted would have shown a systematic change	with local hour angle in the measured intensities of venus and jupiter	if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized	4225.397776561453
7094. recent interferometer measurements	have shown the 960-mc emission of jupiter to be partially	polarized	and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible	disk	4282.765021424484
7095. other than this very significant result most of the information	now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted	to the intensity of the radiation	2864.0254850437227
7096. the concept of apparent	black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from	the moon and the planets	2601.3633888852964
7097. the received radiation is compared with the	radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid	angle as the visible disk of the planet	2752.281645225985
7098. the apparent black-body	disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the	black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that	of the observed radiation	4985.681288422117
7099. the use of this concept does not specify	the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates	as a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond	to the physical temperature of the emitting material	4054.642210224972
7100. the radio	radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should	be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter	wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar	radio noise	5915.593415889186
7101. the quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation	would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less	than 1` k	1863.5813642036824
7102. at meter wave lengths and increase of the order of	10` k in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would	be expected	3672.039087769437
7103. therefore neglecting the extreme outbursts reflected	solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements	of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length	range	2859.5364161421558
7104. radio observations	of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4	1879.3345683564337
7105. 3 mm	to 75 cm and the results are summarized in table 1	790.0369244377041
7106. observations	have also been made at 1	141.12491636582058
7107. 5 mm using optical techniques		7.311136226196986
7108. not all the observers have used	the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness	distribution when reducing the data and this together with	differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers	must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness	temperatures	7429.992202350911
7109. in the observations at 4	14.780282189755152
7110. 3 mm	the diameter of the antenna beam 6'	394.34527656061874
7111. 7 was small enough	to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface	and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution	at three lunar phases	3446.617942791735
7112. these observations indicate that the lunar	maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do	the mountainous regions	3286.0252041016306
7113. mare imbrium seems to be an exception and	remains cooler than the regions which surround it	1248.6612945943587
7114. these contour diagrams	also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with	latitude	1643.3517418620177
7115. very recently observations have been made at 8-mm	wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant	beam width of only about 2'		1916.3170831823322
7116. the constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those	observed at 4	750.8423940022852
7117. 3 mm by coates and apparently the emission	at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface	features	2036.7860612945055
7118. such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several	wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can	be properly	interpreted	3697.649176656322
7119. the observations of mayer mccullough	and sloanaker at 3	261.1592964331493
7120. 15 cm and of sloanaker at 10	140.24090281441968
7121. 3 cm have not	previously	been published and will be briefly described	642.6743637081021
7122. 15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval may 3	to june 19 1956 using the 50-foot reflector at the u s naval	research laboratory in washington	4838.215101094693
7123. the half-intensity diameter	of the antenna beam was about 9' and the angle subtended by the moon	included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes	3108.08338624962
7124. the	antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both	measured so that	the	absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle	of the moon was known	5640.9847008245115
7125. the ratio of the measured antenna temperature	change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature	of the moon over the antenna beam	was found by graphical integration	of the antenna directivity diagram to be 0	4202.077528366776
7126. the measured	brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature	at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna	beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion	of the moon's disk is nearly uniform	6451.274772619542
7127. the result of the observations	is f where the phase angle |qt is measured	in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute	as well as relative errors	3221.9221789764288
7128. this result is plotted along with the 8	250.99369945510284
7129. 6-mm	observations of gibson in figure 1 a	167.68911705383573
7130. the variation	in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much	less than the variation in the 8	3267.396658561146
7131. 6-mm emission as would be expected	from the explanation of piddington and minnett	795.5272776010345
7132. in the discussion	which follows the time average of the radio emission will be	referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic	variation will be called the variable component	4999.1718113629095
7133. 3-cm	observation of sloanaker was made on may 20 1958 using the	84-foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the u	s naval research laboratory	2726.1160958902024
7134. the age of the moon was about 2	days	390.94519735828686
7135. the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was	about 18'	790.3883551969661
7136. 5 and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming	a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for	the moon	3705.154147254955
7137. experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous	graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas	1426.7048859190454
7138. thus the	energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into	the arc	2141.286185931717
7139. it was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss	of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the	total arc energy a detailed energy balance of the anode was established	4037.6053969336776
7140. the anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount	561.2756008715368
7141. the dependence	of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating	gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between	100 amp and 200 amp	3100.164903038364
7142. qualitative observations were made and	high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the	arc at various mass flow velocities	3240.9030200010457
7143. the high heat	fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate	extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation	1740.345884892773
7144. the cooling requirements	are particularly severe at the anode	390.8337574797166
7145. in free burning electric	arcs for instance approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred	to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of	f as measured by the authors- the exact value depending on the arc	atmosphere	4380.427631244412
7146. in plasma generators as currently commercially available	for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than	50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the co0ling	medium of the anode	5641.287504640429
7147. the higher heat transfer rates at the anode	compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical	phenomena occurring in free burning arcs	2735.649388750542
7148. in plasma generators the	superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat	955.9097273909483
7149. the heat	transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1	789.208926407154
7150. heat	of condensation plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging	on the anode	1184.3017221247735
7151. this energy transfer depends on the current the	temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions	in the anode sheath	2325.2542348485895
7152. heat transfer by molecular conduction as well	as by radiation from the arc column	1415.3518539834456
7153. the heat transfer to	the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from	the cathode towards the anode with velocities up f	2995.2911494326263
7154. this phenomenon	has been experimentally investigated in detail by maecker		281.49753203893135
7155. the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the	magnetic field in the arc		983.3897582145922
7156. hence the flow conditions at the anode of free	burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point	2115.953278683275
7157. it is apparent	from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements	for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with	those for the cathode	3096.605696627503
7158. the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify	these conditions; however the anode is still the part receiving	the largest heat flux	3484.2955283820156
7159. an attempt to improve the life of the anodes	or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at	a reduction of the anode loss	2732.13068628936
7160. the following possibilities exist for	achieving this: 1	250.78623342025315
7161. the use of high voltages and low currents by proper	design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given	power output	2461.14362313793
7162. continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode	by flow or magnetic forces	1646.7756735278213
7163. feed back of the energy transferred	to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode	1265.2187173819868
7164. the third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for the	first time by c sheer and co-workers	2347.649040440984
7165. the purpose of	the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish	an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect	of blowing on the arc voltage	3679.6234478049882
7166. gas injection through a porous anode	not only feeds back the energy transferred	to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions	in the arc itself	4857.3568441658
7167. a detailed study of this latter phenomenon	was not attempted in this paper	786.1995270228458
7168. argon was used as a blowing gas to	exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction	1889.332806492447
7169. the anode	material was porous graphite	43.51700745402308
7170. sintered porous metals should be usable	in principle	250.5852309701457
7171. however technical difficulties arise by melting at local	hot spots	372.7195708536875
7172. the experimental arrangement as described below is based	on the geometry of free burning arcs	1649.00758287067
7173. thus direct comparisons can	be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during	the past years and decades by numerous investigators	2599.271253643835
7174. figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic	views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode	holder	3260.095971390606
7175. the cathode consisted of a 14'' diameter thoriated tungsten	rod attached to a water cooled copper tube	1409.614764774927
7176. this tube could be	adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the	required electrode spacing	2595.374889490591
7177. the anode in figure 2 was mounted by means	of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk	2177.348801758719
7178. the	transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially	towards the cathode below	1892.3718700410288
7179. inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere	was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2	1419.3557426779737
7180. argon was also	blown at low velocities through a tube coaxial	with	the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the	arc by air	3892.1856772442743
7181. the anode consisted of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite	plug 14 inch long	949.834090807869
7182. the graphite was national carbon nc	60 which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 this	small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving	the anode	5617.339991130359
7183. the anode plug was inserted into a carbon	anode holder	377.9449629995103
7184. a shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream	temperature of the transpiring gas	1415.2001698639342
7185. it was exposed to a high velocity	gas jet	263.0869793249114
7186. a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided	the chamber above the porous plug into two parts	3046.1211861266393
7187. this arrangement	had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by	natural convection	1255.1019004311843
7188. two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2	served for simultaneous measurement of	the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along	the anode holder	3903.055938877051
7189. three thermocouples were placed at different locations	in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its	temperature	1718.5501405552634
7190. another anode holder used in the experiments is shown	in figure 3	963.8393067031095
7191. in this design the anode holder is water cooled and	the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring	the temperature rise of the coolant	2986.9006853266633
7192. to reduce heat transfer from	the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon	shield was attached tothe surface providing an air gap of 116	inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder	6589.351236836215
7193. in addition	the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil	to reduce radiation	1410.7118571055162
7194. temperatures of the shield and of the surface	of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account	for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode	plug	5154.492606218051
7195. the argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated	by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator	1735.3469753947415
7196. the power	source was a commercial d c rectifier	392.6764103463327
7197. at 100 amp the	360 cycle ripple was less than 0	500.2201465022657
7198. 5 v with a resistive	load	65.41970323591494
7199. the current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and	measured with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter	1735.1665599443634
7200. the arc voltage	was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode	and cathode holders	2352.3644077463514
7201. because of the falling characteristic of the	rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation	1402.5275861411599
7202. a high frequency starter was used to start the arc	563.1254551248791
7203. procedure and error analysis	_1	14.794962210595395
7204. transpiration cooled anode with	the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed	with two goals in mind	2357.267919413768
7205. the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced	as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat	balance can be made	2856.4267338650857
7206. in order to reduce the number of variable parameters	all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0	2799.4076492615645
7207. 5''	and a current of 100 amp	92.99659510698001
7208. the argon flow through the porous anode	was varied systematically between f	957.7996506689445
7209. the lower limit	was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started	to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug	and that it became highly unstable	3755.9716953207885
7210. the upper limit was determined by	the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature	since only a small region of the anode was struck by the	arc	4461.721264739369
7211. this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the	anode surface changed size and location continuously	1724.6172940607617
7212. for each	mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured	559.7856060874394
7213. to measure the surface	temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer	1260.0663388152864
7214. as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug	970.0588386035266
7215. its temperature	was denoted by f	43.22620241596131
7216. the size of this hot region was estimated	by eye	559.1164803408444
7217. the rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards	the outer diameter of the plug	1431.2889299224328
7218. the mean temperature of this region	was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the	edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug	4081.7942250717633
7219. it was denoted by f	14.735199967088448
7220. the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to	the following relation: f where x is the fraction of the plug area	covered by the hot spot	4666.8085524155995
7221. assuming thermal equilibrium between the	anode surface and the transpiring argon the gas enthalpy rise through	the anode was calculated according to the relation f whereby the specific	heat of argon was taken as f	3761.297148347614
7222. this calculation results in	an	enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally	distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass	velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures	6405.488127947249
7223. the upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple	shown in figure 2 was f	936.5600943292629
7224. the f values are listed in table 1	together	with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages	2115.135249786579
7225. simultaneously	with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer	readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode	holder as indicated on figure 2	2864.1411644094514
7226. some of these temperatures are plotted	in figure 4	390.8361885518698
7227. they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate	within the accuracy of these measurements	1101.7930575808284
7228. thus the dotted line shown	in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for	all blowing rates	2810.567216741348
7229. the thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown	in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of	f	1719.9366498859297
7230. this temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which	the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned	2824.8490887993767
7231. it	is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode	holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward	the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements	3675.2685228114315
7232. the reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder	and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also	be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces	and of the specific geometry	5936.7757248038015
7233. the total heat loss through the anode	holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical	piece into the adjacent metal parts	2607.864886711254
7234. it was calculated from the	temperature gradient f at f inch as f	1184.2187108476598
7235. the total heat flux from	the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby f the temperature	distribution of figure 4 gives f for all blowing rates assuming f	3120.2629688808215
7236. the temperature dependent value of |e was taken from ref	7	751.3048648815923
7237. the radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to	f where f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures f	and f calculated analogously to equation	3343.064040401502
7238. a band viscometer is shown in figure 2	250.8523920626165
7239. it consists of two blocks	with flat surfaces held apart by shims	638.7822588937848
7240. there is a small well in	the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed	2578.200538049457
7241. a tape	of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the	fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks	2855.693912126324
7242. in	normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull	the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks	4282.523313002819
7243. after it	has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known	distance is recorded	1575.4497179925493
7244. by the use of various weights data for a force-rate	of shear graph can be obtained	1885.310506441435
7245. the instrument used for this	work was a slight modification of that previously described	942.6710909134114
7246. in	this test a f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and	pulley at a rate of f with a clearance of 0	4095.255254681181
7247. 002'' on each side of	the tape	93.93972987956293
7248. this gives a rate of shear of f	248.61867706977696
7249. this however can only	be considered	approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the	build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley	during the runs	3461.388428258645
7250. the face of one block contained a hole 116''	in diameter which led to a	manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure	3505.5915075026364
7251. although	there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were	two distinct types	1245.9908579981154
7252. two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure	when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures	which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures	generated by the other two	5659.728903649242
7253. figure 3 shows the data on	a silicone fluid labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal	pressure	1734.743695809447
7254. although the tape was run for over 1 hr a steady	state was not reached and it was concluded that the reason for this was	that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material	fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow	rate	7600.7048786179785
7255. a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of	the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure	were to be made in a reasonable time	3551.297265522405
7256. a back pressure was then introduced	and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated	which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure	5034.005270979996
7257. by this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted	by a sample of polybutene was	over half an atmosphere	2031.2777665923174
7258. the actual pressure was not determined because	the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand	2583.202385020105
7259. the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes	with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300	2161.368953593121
7260. these are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more	newtonian because of their lower molecular weight	2821.123156211718
7261. the maximum suction	was 3	14.803646643786342
7262. 25'' of test fluid measured from the top of the block	and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids	2817.5038341016007
7263. it is presumed	that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor	of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same	fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly	of the apparatus	4044.9124223700637
7264. this negative pressure is not explained by the	velocity head f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings	by several magnitudes	3489.083394428332
7265. these experiments can be considered	exploratory only	94.40411042853562
7266. however they do demonstrate the presence of large	normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast	by the theory in the first part of the paper	4840.001264156292
7267. they also give information	which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument	for the measurement of the normal pressures	2187.7859704970074
7268. such an instrument would	be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well	as theoretical studies	2374.0161822965642
7269. the elasticity as a parameter of fluids	which	is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter	which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial	materials	3558.10051005598
7270. such an instrument is expected to be especially useful	if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as	printing inks paints adhesives molten plastics and bread dough for	the elasticity is related to those various properties termed length	shortness spinnability etc which are usually judged	by subjective methods at present	7850.3312679408355
7271. the actual change f	caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential	times the volume just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic	pressure head	3238.319755302914
7272. if the volume is the molal volume then f is obtained	on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists	3504.687535508464
7273. although the f calculation is obvious by analogy with that	for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm	it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects	3546.120842549044
7274. consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional	area of a opposed by a manometer with a height of h	and a cross-sectional area	of a	4863.588956850103
7275. if f is the change per unit volume in gibbs function	caused by the shear field at constant p and t and |r	is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of	the system above the reference height is f	4463.716123562424
7276. f is the work necessary	to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h	1900.9436129590063
7277. the total volume of the system above the reference height is f and	h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential	energy of the system in terms of h	3545.569601793457
7278. the minimum total potential	energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to h	and equating to zero	2604.7805127230063
7279. this gives f which is the pressure	94.50173093199645
7280. this	is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum	gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential	energy for equilibrium	3693.593745545292
7281. this method can be extended to include the	concentration differences caused by shear fields	940.8333511510484
7282. the relation between	osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be developed in an	analogous way	2116.5318714048017
7283. in the above development we have applied the thermodynamics	of equilibrium to	the steady state	1097.6725675218745
7284. this can be justified thermodynamically in this case	and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared	3043.2035506157667
7285. this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by philippoff	that the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be	applied to flowing solutions	2461.444663928259
7286. there is one exception to the above	statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax	by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should	be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar	6548.9389381001965
7287. if the mechanics	are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also	be similar	1259.2883222161622
7288. the concept of the strain energy as a gibbs function	difference f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is	compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies	of fluids undergoing shear	5703.094048510729
7289. essentially these birefringence studies	show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45` to	the direction of shear and as the rate of shear increases the direction	of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction	of shear	4382.822383449914
7290. according to philippoff the recoverable shear s is	given by f where |c is the angle of extinction	2372.0024873367956
7291. from this and	the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic	energy of deformation which should be equal to the f calculated from	the pressure normal to the shearing face	3669.1353043248137
7292. there is another	means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses	in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature	and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids	in shear fields	6689.084141783887
7293. these droplets are distorted by the normal forces	just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's	hands	2334.0011180712654
7294. these droplets appear to be ellipsoids and it is mathematically	convenient to assume that they are	1874.7957022148598
7295. if they are not ellipsoids	the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation	645.6652130441651
7296. the direction of	the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction	of the major axis of the ellipsoids	3266.422636507975
7297. mason and taylor both show that	the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates of shear and	that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear	3558.0258133726793
7298. this is	of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence	studies	1640.522438914028
7299. the relative forces can be calculated from the various	radii of curvature if we assume: the surface tension is uniform	on the surface of the drop	2748.073661632788
7300. that because of the low viscosity	of the fluid the internal pressure is the same in all directions	2359.316192131449
7301. the kinetic effects are negligible	14.811477536354412
7302. since the	shape of the drop conforms to the force field it does not appreciably	affect the distribution of forces in the fluid	3487.6755555592053
7303. these are reasonable	assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity	fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear	2037.2727296241235
7304. just as the pressure	exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is f and the pressure	exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is f the	pressure exerted by any curved surface is f where |g is the interfacial	tension and f and f are the two radii of curvature	7635.423721457259
7305. this	formula is given by rumscheidt and mason	167.94597694675707
7306. if a is the major	axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes	the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis	is f and the difference in pressure along the a and b	axes is f	7144.004448766743
7307. there are no data published in the literature on	the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas	1878.184850039271
7308. however	there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate	suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper	by mason and bartok	3687.6844982881025
7309. this viscosity of the material in the drops	is of course not negligible	787.2471425932856
7310. measurements on the photograph in this	paper give f at the maximum rate of shear of f	2113.630306878631
7311. if it is assumed	that the formula given by lodge of f cosec 2|c applies the	pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle	of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension	can be calculated	4475.168274633315
7312. its value was f from the above data	250.8838646866781
7313. this	appears to be high as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity	of the material in the drops	1741.3550264897235
7314. it is appropriate to call attention	to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous	to rubber-like deformation	2812.5435712052267
7315. the internal energy of an ideal	gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume	1578.6181153209072
7316. in other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant	temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted	into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink	5209.543065595464
7317. this means that	work equals q which in turn equals f	501.4264513178185
7318. there is a	well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that	f where \q is the probability that state	could be reached by chance alone	4066.6033694541666
7319. this is known as	conformational entropy	43.85029113411165
7320. this conformational entropy is in this case	equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other	energies involved	3264.450178076791
7321. note that though the ideal gas itself contains no	additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure	1750.3455818089892
7322. the energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come	as thermal energy from its surroundings	2601.1081957511146
7323. a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline f as a	function of magnetic field and temperature is presented	1571.170194470606
7324. f is paramagnetic	and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects	lead to line broadening	2111.907781551545
7325. the lines are asymmetric and over the	range of field f gauss and temperature f the asymmetry increases with	increasing f and decreasing t	2461.1000320351823
7326. an isotropic resonance shift	of f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine	contact interaction	2114.207598729397
7327. the general theory of resonance shifts is used to	derive a general expression for the second moment f of a polycrystalline	paramagnetic sample and is specialized to f	2976.6251607863373
7328. the theory predicts	a linear dependence of f on f where |j is the experimentally	determined curie-weiss constant	2361.0006821015318
7329. the experimental second moment	f conforms to the relation f in agreement with theory	938.1129722992982
7330. hence the	electron paramagnetic effects can be separated from the nuclear	effects	964.1924278801013
7331. the paramagnetic dipole effects provide some	information on the particle shapes	504.63119851019957
7332. the nuclear dipole effects provide	some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry	of the f bond in f remains in doubt	4086.7063044631977
7333. the	magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a	tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei	2024.2720558585036
7334. it	is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since	quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations	of structure	3264.3726543227294
7335. f appeared to be well suited for the study	of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired	electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple	and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong f bond provides	structural interest	4694.976540936861
7336. we first discuss the f bond in f	250.3524142950518
7337. we	then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles	with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment	2465.925821276209
7338. indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from	nuclear effects	752.5473288194688
7339. the information provided by the electron paramagnetic	effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted	in terms of various motional-modified models of the f bond	in f	3200.1002885016246
7340. theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond	generally agree that the f bond will be linear in the absence of	peculiarities of packing in the solid	3913.5087705275487
7341. moreover it will be asymmetric	until a certain critical f distance is reached below which it will	become symmetric	1734.9775335969218
7342. there is ample evidence from many sources that the	f bond in f is symmetric	1648.1218622398815
7343. the f distance in f is 2	93.55541579552958
7344. there is evidence though less convincing than for f that the f	bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric	2352.295203182354
7345. here the f distance	is 2	43.7592754114453
7346. a number of semiempirical estimates by various workers	lead to the conclusion that the f bond becomes symmetric when the	f bond length is about 2	4089.449960960731
7347. 5 a but aside from the possible	example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports	of symmetric f bonds	2029.2896634833312
7348. douglass has studied the crystal structure	of f by x-ray diffraction	748.8176695416998
7349. he finds the structure contains an f	bond with the f distance of f	941.1863834692145
7350. there is then the possibility that	this f bond is symmetric although douglass was unable to determine	its symmetry from his x-ray data	3474.0023436461584
7351. douglass found f to be	trigonal laue symmetry f with f f	635.942123551807
7352. x-ray and experimental	density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic	ion density of f	2813.9660466891446
7353. the x-ray data did not permit douglass	to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity	led him to assume a center of symmetry	2856.0369861144027
7354. under this assumption	the space group must be f and the following are the positions	of the atoms in the unit cell	3280.9054343666235
7355. this space group requires the hydrogen	bond to be symmetric	376.5505075988766
7356. douglass found powder intensity calculations	and measurements to agree best for f	961.7914117493538
7357. these data lead to a structure	in which sheets of cr atoms lie between two sheets of o	atoms	1720.519212931294
7358. the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each cr	atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of o atoms	3264.99439103761
7359. the f	layers are stacked normal to the 111 axis with the lower oxygens	of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower	layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers	4047.2498449268096
7360. the	separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds	391.26483246887875
7361. a drawing of the	structure is to be found in reference 6	643.775786052703
7362. the gross details	of the structure appear reasonable	250.60334616092163
7363. the structure appears to be unique	among rooh compounds but is the same as that assumed by	f	1570.687931022897
7364. the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits	and the volume per oxygen is about normal	2610.780087116702
7365. however the possible absence	of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off f	but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent with f at	f and f at f where f represents the oxygens	on one side of the f layers and f those on the other side	5145.564925794373
7366. however	any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely	short f interlayer distance of 2	1892.5326682697228
7367. 55 a or the non-hydrogen-bonded	f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2	1095.856464436833
7368. hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in	this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence	3887.008193705688
7369. the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release	the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions	along the 111 axis	2860.7532768729493
7370. if the f bond is linear then there	are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms: the hydrogen	atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the	oxygen sheets; all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet	is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other; hydrogen atoms	are asymmetrically placed either randomly or in an ordered way so	that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others	are closer to the lower oxygen atoms	0.30166232349522504
7371. position appears to us	to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on	general chemical structural grounds	2177.254449329441
7372. a randomization of ups and	downs is more likely than ordered ups and downs in	position since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the	position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also	since ordered up and down implies a larger unit cell for	which no evidence exists	7701.042602520785
7373. therefore the only unknown structural feature	would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically	or asymmetrically	1741.490085284732
7374. douglass prepared his sample of f by thermal decomposition of	aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`c	1633.3014739093878
7375. dr douglass was kind enough	to lend us about 5 grams of his material	935.2944629825154
7376. this material proved	to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on	various portions of the sample	2581.9927210361243
7377. subsequently we learned from douglass	that his sample contained a few percent f impurity	940.865414508394
7378. since f	is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically	contaminated f would be suspect	2352.41319885695
7379. plane suggested another	preparation of f which we used here	373.3381715749438
7380. 500 ml of 1m aqueous	f	with 1 g f added are heated in a bomb at 170`c for 48 hours	3049.276473779034
7381. a very fine gray solid is formed water-washed	by centrifugation and dried at 110`c	944.2503209704419
7382. differential thermal	analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340`c and	a large endothermic reaction at 470`c	2359.397880735296
7383. this latter reaction is	in accord with the reported decomposition of f	640.8354286104445

7417. spectra were obtained over the temperature range	of 77-294`k	259.4171961621622
7418. for the low-temperature measurements the sample was	cooled	by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and	eades	3256.073488011278
7419. the temperature was maintained to within about f for the	period of time required to make the measurement	1569.3233175041041
7420. one sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation	at 375`c showed the presence of adsorbed water	as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow	at room temperature and which disappeared due to broadening at low	temperature	6559.400908737198
7421. the data reported here are either from spectra from which	the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra	of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375`c which contain no	adsorbed water	3655.656981610141
7422. the measured powder density of the f used	here was about f approximately one-third that of the crystal density		1636.579040271296
7423. such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of	about f	635.5868237172361

7429. this sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to	that described above	786.2094975223465
7430. polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants	were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates	spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates	and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited	6312.622188733262
7431. the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse	262.0517796837083
7432. the best	known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty spray-dried	detergent formulations for household use	2114.084680378296
7433. these widely advertised	products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on	high-sudsing	synthetic organic actives	and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture	of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate	3964.7340408043965
7434. in the	household market there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations	based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder;	light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder; and the	dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none	of which are now nationally advertised	7207.088170353563
7435. a well-publicized entrant	which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent	with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and	active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builderactive	ratio	3884.7368090525733
7436. hard-surface cleaning in household application is	represented by two classes of alkaline products: the formulations	made expressly for machine dishwashers and the general-purpose	cleaners used for walls and woodwork	4669.42724323523
7437. the better quality products in	both of these lines contain phosphate builders	645.1046122293714
7438. in addition many of	the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis	in trisodium orthophosphate which is still the major ingredient of	a number of such products	4812.32938994672
7439. many scouring powders now also contain phosphates	94.52313449879904
7440. these hard-surface cleaners are discussed in chapter 28	249.18685890269717
7441. cleaning process	cleaning or detergent action is entirely	a matter of surfaces	644.5323750538926
7442. wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid	substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or surface-active	material	2599.8977087944195
7443. an oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface	cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved	1414.20275333238
7444. one	gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of f	1646.0917645527993
7445. in contrast a metal coupon f in size would have a magnitude from	100000 to a million less	1576.8059076687246
7446. even here there is room for some variation	for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical	reactivity	2606.2369790909297
7447. spring used a brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning	study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending	upon surface roughness	1882.8450072046162
7448. there are considerable differences between	the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning	960.8669164310519
7449. exclusive	of esthetic values such as high- or low-foam level perfume content	etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles	are high	2616.364621926871
7450. no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic	actives are simply not suitable for this application since they	do not give adequate soil removal	4263.120325862726
7451. this is best demonstrated by practical	washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with	the same detergent formulation	1874.4942596494045
7452. a good formulation will keep the clothes	clean and white after many washings; whereas with a poor formulation	the clothes exhibit a build-up of tattle-tale grey and dirty	spots- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash	6095.039038109372
7453. since	practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number	of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation	of detergents	2309.762812114025
7454. harris has indicated that two devices the launder-ometer	and terg-o-tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent	testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled	fabrics	4470.51209878057
7455. also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general	use	373.6618348078101
7456. the soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations	are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by	even the best detergent formulation in a single wash	5479.483872035935
7457. in this way	numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations	can be obtained by measuring the reflectance of the	cloth swatches before and after washing	2973.0827977297386
7458. soil redeposition is evaluated	by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones	962.8472064732014
7459. as is the case with	the surface-active agent the requirements for builders to be used in	detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high	2461.5080518546292
7460. large numbers	of potential builders have been investigated but none have been	found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide	range of conditions met in practice	4831.445270212078
7461. the problems of hard-surface	cleaning are not nearly as complex	373.7352525955502
7462. in hard-surface cleaning the	inorganic salts are more important than the organic active	1186.1997039147502
7463. indeed	when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any	wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present	in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation	3218.204075932655
7464. hydroxides	orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important	inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners	1179.0264217401948
7465. in addition the	polyphosphates are also used probably acting more as peptizing agents	than anything else	1263.2171055044778
7466. the importance of the inorganic constituents in	hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers	2122.4901528654623
7467. chemistry of washing	although there is no question	but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena	which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that	these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the	present this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture	of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces	5662.155242132626
7468. the purpose of washing is obviously to remove soils which are arbitrarily	classed in the four major categories given below:	dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually	inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit	colloidal properties	6943.094391423251
7469. greasy soils which are typified by	hydrocarbons and fats	261.30536441522725
7470. stains which include the wide variety of nonparticulate	materials which give color even when present in very low concentration	on the soiled object	3492.831125506981
7471. miscellaneous soils which primarily	include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave	a residue	1259.1833142403525
7472. the dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically	held by surface irregularities to some extent	1655.2364031355064
7473. however a major factor	in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under	the name of van der waal's forces	2180.6370834955123
7474. this is a theoretically complicated	dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle	to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick	to an uncharged surface	4478.17197692954
7475. obviously if colloidal particles bear charges	of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is	not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate	will be greatly reinforced	3762.819805423887
7476. likewise a charged particle will tend	to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charged particle	will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite	charge	5008.830667992699
7477. in addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface	by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including	liquid greases	2466.8714662228936
7478. greases stains and miscellaneous soils	are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface	963.988258399195
7479. in most cases these soils	are taken up as liquids through capillary action	790.2142391725174
7480. in an essentially	static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless	the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active	agent	4654.515501417917
7481. the washing process whereby soils are removed consists	basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles	and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off	the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating	agent	4555.708633726479
7482. greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water;	and	natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium	salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove	5460.317640943229
7483. the detergent active is that substance	which primarily acts to remove greasy soils	786.5331864093164
7484. the other constituents	in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains	and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils	3704.0437243377246
7485. as is well known	detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately	high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the	property of forming micelles in solution	3225.4213853581064
7486. physicochemical investigations	of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there	is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below	a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration	5168.306809845267
7487. below the critical micelle concentration monomers and some	dimers are present	504.16397278586163
7488. in the critical micelle region there is	a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles which have	a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80	3899.8486161591927
7489. for anionics	these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which	the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups	face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase	3099.762913144033
7490. obviously	hydrophobic	substances such as greases oils or particles having	a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle	than in the aqueous phase	4858.805442920145
7491. micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable	amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be	increased as much as approximately two-fold	2464.8591691855972
7492. although the matter has	not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles	in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process	3690.620623066364
7493. related to micelle formation is the technologically important	ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces	in such a manner that the polar end of the molecule is directed	towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the	oily phase	4379.871304323265
7494. in the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated	in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant	2354.810398105633
7495. then during washing	the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets	can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of	mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase	3662.363541955805
7496. obviously a substance	which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of	the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off	the greasy soil	4846.4097474331875
7497. substances other than detergent actives also	tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other	contiguous condensed phases	2020.0747831763572
7498. this is particularly true of highly charged	ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes	2354.263625536583
7499. whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly	sorbed at oil-water interfaces the highly charged ions are most strongly	sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting	an ionic structure	3333.0705778310535
7500. thus for aqueous	media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic	or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealized builder as	a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent	5015.80346333248
7501. from the equilibrium	sorption data which are available it seems logical to expect	that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of	the dirt so as to give it a greatly increased	negative charge	3852.8744301002384
7502. the charged particles then repel each other and are	also repelled from the charged surface which almost invariably bears	a negative charge under washing conditions	3918.7351210589754
7503. the negatively charged dirt	particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase	1103.8906339137516
7504. this	hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic	actives in detergency	1641.0252338000541
7505. it does not consider the kinetic effects	of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will	be discussed later	1727.4139652125807
7506. the crude picture of	the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as: f	the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may	be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale	6059.879581115293
7507. freed soil	must be dispersed and protected against flocculation	260.7188162489763
7508. cleaned cloth	must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil	749.2757073657937
7509. it is	evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one	detergent constituent acting alone are severe	1727.559335015262
7510. upon consideration	of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing	process it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent	constituents having synergistic properties has gained widespread	acceptance	5637.377919854631
7511. in the over-all process it is difficult to assign a	pure role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation;	and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles	of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there	is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making	up a given commercial organic active	5420.737036076343
7512. the thermal exchange of chlorine between f and liquid f is	readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180` and above	3232.5903671008377
7513. the	photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of	unity in the liquid phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the f	2729.497893173164
7514. in the gas phase with f of f and f of f quantum yields	of the	order of f have been observed at 85`	3670.365162378307
7515. despite extensive attempts	to obtain highly pure reagents serious difficulty was experienced in	obtaining reproducible rates of reaction	1566.5283200848257
7516. it appears possible to set	a lower limit of about f for the activation energy of the abstraction	of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine	atom to form f radical	5662.802017964013
7517. the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction	appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light	intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at	the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular	radical combination reactions	4549.1143092766015
7518. because of the simplicity	of the molecules isotopic exchange reactions between elemental	halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer	particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic	kinetic data	5010.814361283257
7519. it would appear that it should be possible to determine	unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both	the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies	of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals	as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen	bond	5315.650000484615
7520. the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed	particularly suited for such studies	1186.0754802824274
7521. it should be possible to prepare	very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum	system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid	2597.327797687443
7522. it should be	possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by	the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to	addition of radioactive chlorine	4065.8035702155407
7523. furthermore the exchange would not	be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it	would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for	abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be	too high; also it would be expected that f would compete very effectively	with any impurities as a scavenger for f radicals	5752.343620259935
7524. contrary	to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree	of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare	especially pure reagents	4302.095799601442
7525. we are reporting these investigations	here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently	simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results	furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of	chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride	4403.951169614013
7526. matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a	tube of resublimed f into an evacuated pyrex system where it was condensed	with liquid air	3880.78706965125
7527. it was then distilled at least three times	from a trap at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction	being retained in each distillation	3105.2719245103826
7528. the purified product was	stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break seal	1648.167051227369
7529. of several	methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange	of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature	was found to be the most satisfactory	2971.389212860003
7530. to prepare the latter	silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing f obtained	from the oak ridge national laboratory	2842.1292466511777
7531. the silver chloride was	fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant	product of f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line	3111.596271387458
7532. previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange	was allowed to take place	1412.5543807666272
7533. the radiochlorine was stored at -78`	in a tube equipped with a break seal	943.6181074517469
7534. liter quantities of mallinckrodt	low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated	with f and f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt	tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches	5648.276181340259
7535. the mixture was then extracted	with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride	was distilled on a vigreux column a 25% center cut being retained	which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of f	4048.1113492536288
7536. purified	inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described	above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with	a break seal	4669.810664265647
7537. this chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated	for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum	system and the excess chlorine distilled off	2609.58532246907
7538. the required amount of	carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on	a manifold on a vacuum line	3063.6019404294257
7539. the desired amounts of inactive chlorine	and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on	the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold	as a whole was sealed off	3667.615383499104
7540. the contents of the manifold for liquid phase	experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction	tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off	4467.366091310632
7541. the reactants	for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm	attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold	of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off	3659.8387862683276
7542. this method	in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations	reaction conditions	- the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction	studies were prepared in pyrex capillary tubing 2	3372.575986594973
7543. 5 mm id and	about 15 cm long	168.03700514787002
7544. in a few experiments the tubes were made from	standard 6 mm id pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness	2812.517025180125
7545. both	types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres	exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`	1565.5550664470604
7546. the photochemical reaction	cells consisted of 10 mm id pyrex tubing 5	954.162687725168
7547. 5 cm	long diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed	through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces	2187.0482092171897
7548. these cells were used rather than square pyrex tubing because	of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon	tetrachloride	3471.0961216495243
7549. the round cells were reproducibly positioned in the	light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window	1735.3502853506325
7550. two types of light source were used a thousand watt projection	lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc	2612.3968069090715
7551. the light was filtered	by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that	only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride	could enter the reaction cell	3467.9251295455697
7552. relative incident light intensities	were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system	750.9901260819937
7553. changes of intensity	on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying	the distance of the light source from the cell	2732.785622389842
7554. following reaction	the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous	sodium iodide solution	2366.415022893165
7555. carrier f was added and the aqueous and	organic phases were separated		344.9105663344141
7556. after	titration of the liberated f with f aliquots of the aqueous and	of the organic	phase were counted in a solution-type geiger tube	3685.435655657407
7557. in the liquid	phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was	determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments	after emptying	2985.5677364860358
7558. the fraction of exchange was determined as the	ratio of the countsminute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the	countsminute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for	equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon	tetrachloride empirically determined correction being made for the	difference in counting efficiency of f in f and f	7914.294397926092
7559. in studying the liquid phase thermal	reaction some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared	and analyzed	1733.0986907512029
7560. experiments were done at 180 200 210 220`	247.54437693542314
7561. following	observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly	identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and	exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per	cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether	the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine	to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface	to volume ratio in the reaction tubes	0.20124717349522497
7562. in addition to the method	described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared	by the electrolysis of a f eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange	of f with molten f	5462.924747521434
7563. calcium hydride was substituted for f	as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride	789.2557082670118
7564. no correlation between	these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found	1192.2311218598093
7565. the reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from f of the chlorine	exchanged per hour to 0	1419.1052968265826
7566. in most cases the	chlorine	concentration was about f	392.5318325279398
7567. sets of reaction tubes containing 0	43.61949959431468
7568. 2 of	an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another	both gave reaction rates in the range of 0	3672.956319849127
7569. 4 of the chlorine	exchanged per hour	94.66139407996654
7570. no detectable reaction was found at room temperature	the liquid	- the liquid phase photochemical	exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible	than the thermal exchange although still erratic	3544.8928950719737
7571. the improvement	was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells	prepared as a group on the same manifold	1895.7283279260014
7572. rather large differences were	still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings	1181.3559294410893
7573. some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in	the temperature range from 40 to 85` in a further endeavor to determine	the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on	the activation energy and the effect of light intensity	4473.790666895758
7574. in all cases	there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of	illumination	1887.9406987870832
7575. by comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold	temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging	from 11 to 18 f was observed while dependence on the first power of	the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases	4195.284744736865
7576. it	was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent	of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated	for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions	based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl	oxalate and of chlorine and considering the spectral distribution of	the light source	8209.265815144623
7577. these estimates indicated that the quantum yield	for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65`	is of the order of magnitude of unity	2726.706217562064
7578. when typical reaction	cells to which 0	141.06180882127597
7579. 3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated	chlorine and phosgene were produced	1250.5884233468746
7580. exchange was also observed	the photochemical	- although there was some variation	in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or	to variation in wall effects the photochemical exchange in the gas phase	was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare	the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose	of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration	and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate	0.30166232349522504
7581. data	on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity	are given in table 1	1572.2611524917722
7582. in series 1 the relative light	intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the	reaction cell over the range from 14	3914.8141533909084
7583. the last column	shows the rate of exchange that would have been oserved at a relative	intensity of 4 calculated on the assumptions that	the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square	of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly	proportional to the incident light intensity	5266.799868716544
7584. direct proportionality	of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining	the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2	where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen	6216.7866687253545
7585. the poynting-robertson effect	which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles	by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging	solar radiation causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much	shorter than the age of the earth	4545.4756430704
7586. the radial velocity varies inversely	as the particle size- a 1000-|m-diameter particle near the	orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years	4127.376604554172
7587. whipple	extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation	pressure which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag	1742.7507385420272
7588. further the corpuscular radiation ie the solar-wind protons	must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow	diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson	effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational	force	6823.6016354209305
7589. the poynting-robertson effect causes the semi-major	axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis	with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move	toward the sun	3347.349130098949
7590. also planetary gravitational attraction increases	the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is	approached	2608.3376854092085
7591. at one astronomical unit from the sun	the dust orbits are probably nearly circular	951.1834466917624
7592. if such is the case	the particles within a distance of about f km of the earth	will	have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential	energy and they will be captured into orbits about the earth	6468.3889537605155
7593. de	jager has calculated the times required for these particles	to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the poynting-robertson	effect which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more	eccentric	without changing the semi-major axis	4138.216367553236
7594. this effect can give rise to	a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth	1183.70483481948
7595. since there is	a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the	radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise	micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space	3230.2555468742735
7596. there	are several possible sources	22.18108435199721
7597. according to whipple cometary	debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the	sun maintaining a fairly steady state	1900.3682115916731
7598. asteroidal collisions are also	thought to contribute material	249.5539400769951
7599. it is also possible that some of	the dust in the vicinity of the earth originated from meteoritic impacts	upon the moon	2181.185922843701
7600. one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite	flux in space	1189.8528653429394
7601. even in the neighborhood of the earth where information	has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux	values vary by at least four orders of magnitude	2996.3650497881813
7602. this large discrepancy	demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the	lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved	2824.0133295802943
7603. beyond a	few million kilometers from the earth but still in the region of the	earth's orbit a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable	3010.556245254461
7604. at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less	certain	964.064557821438
7605. there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite	environment	371.67909745750296
7606. direct information has been obtained from rockets	and satellites equipped with impact sensors	1192.7698687001932
7607. in addition the size	distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may	be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain	1871.8761099334122
7608. from the brightness of	the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal	light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial	distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic	plane	6188.333553228591
7609. another important source of evidence only recently receiving	much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic	component	1875.7802737512507
7610. the cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors	in remote regions are valuable in this category	2113.5556596436427
7611. the data provide a	measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth	1254.7426055285837
7612. the direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the	earth is	obtained from piezoelectric sensors	and from wire gages; these instruments are installed on rockets satellites	and space probes	4695.399650984529
7613. statistically the most significant data have	been collected from the sensors on 1958 alpha	1958 delta 2	1416.4212724872903
7614. these	vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough	times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure	3468.50738327492
7615. many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products	contribute some information	504.4828096522183
7616. the impact rate on 1958 alpha	for 153 events was f for particles of mass greater than f	; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration	and an assumed impact velocity of f	4124.877675214953
7617. the data show daily and diurnal	variations	94.1399483129064
7618. ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred	between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate	was as much as an order of magnitude	5004.251030152876
7619. one may conclude that most	of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams	which intersect the earth's orbit	1885.3597618416545
7620. there have been contradictory	reports from 1958 delta 2 and the data quoted here are believed	to be the more reliable	3072.9843945487423
7621. on may 15 a very large increase occurred	with f of mass between f and f; for the next two days	the impact rate was f; and for the next nine days the impact rate	was less than f	4108.214491050733
7622. the data for the first day indicate	a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may	have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux	4491.248787465565
7623. preliminary	data from 1959 eta give an average impact rate of f for masses	larger than f for about 1000 events in a 22-day period		1793.2743174677078
7624. the day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor	of 4	748.6674862189086
7625. the data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations	373.8990069963242
7626. note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 alpha and	that the flux is one fifth as large	3048.592702927527
7627. if one assumes that the average	flux did not change between measurements a mass-distribution curve is	obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius	to the inverse 72 power of the radius	3846.455275411355
7628. space probes have	yielded little information	65.16214693408466
7629. pioneer 1 recorded a decrease in flux	with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours	2044.6138157876599
7630. with	detectors	sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts	the second and third russian space probes indicate that the flux	of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones	5775.427524720944
7631. being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity	639.173891261913
7632. the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle	parameters is very uncertain	1411.443650897541
7633. many workers believe that the response	is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation	deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic	velocities	2728.7923907411596
7634. however one must expect that vaporization and ejection	of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear	relationship	3055.1616351339244
7635. in the united states most of the sensors are calibrated	by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces	1573.8415861485266
7636. the	russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse	from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder	being momentum of ejected material from the sensor	5184.276735301404
7637. this ejection	momentum is linearly related to the particle energy	377.4808066790562
7638. they quote	about the same mass threshold as that of the us apparatus but	a momentum threshold about 40 times greater	3036.312658148151
7639. there is a difference	in the experimental arrangement in that the us microphones are	attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments	are isolated from the skin	3103.7093443790864
7640. the threshold mass is derived from the	momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of f	in the us work and f in the	ussr work	4676.356732421312
7641. the threshold	mass of about f corresponds to a 10-|m-diameter sphere of	density f	932.6816657533312
7642. however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable	since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound	meteorite structure with densities as low as f	4471.530529886955
7643. to what extent	such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown	500.5629568253727
7644. the velocity	value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction	of the dust is orbiting about the earth only about one third the above-mentioned	average velocity should be used in deriving the mass	5972.629178577094
7645. zodiacal	light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust	blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture	is in circular orbits about the sun as indicated by the trend of the	smaller visible meteors	4319.528972325791
7646. the diurnal variation in the observed flux	may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the	incident velocity	3260.611957904174
7647. the flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood	of the earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and	visual meteor data	2033.982245022437
7648. a summary of meteorite data prepared by whipple	on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence	is given in table 5-1	3246.491957131494
7649. from an estimated mass of 25 g for a	zero-magnitude meteorite the other masses are derived with the assumption	of a mass decrease by a factor of 2	2980.4223231772985
7650. 512 for each unit increase in	magnitude	140.998363543778
7651. the radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres	of density f except for the smallest particles which must have a	higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of	solar-radiation pressure	3939.069340661993
7652. the flux values are for all particles with	masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the	numbers of visual meteors	4078.092625650914
7653. it is assumed that the flux values increase	by a factor of 2	784.4288604786777
7654. 512 per magnitude in accordance with the opinion	that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant	3040.283158002054
7655. the values agree with the data from 1958 alpha and 1959 eta	646.5068571773705
7656. the figures	in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50	per cent shielding by the earth; hence these figures apply immediately	above the earth's atmosphere	4488.300502993918
7657. the unshielded flux is given	in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the	flux in interplanetary space near the earth	2475.0469612511433
7658. of course if there	is a dust blanket around the earth the fluxes in interplanetary space	should be less than the figures given here	3705.0382929210195
7659. note that the mass	scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously	used; for example jacchia derived a scale of 0	2608.3319002199073
7660. 15 g for	a f zero-magnitude meteorite	140.060184349061
7661. the older scales were based on theoretical	estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into	light	1417.8483305268942
7662. the mass scale used in table 5-1 was derived on the assumption	that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum	transfer to the trail by the meteorite permitting the calculation of	the mass if the velocity is known	6573.880524645829
7663. a concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations	sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude	949.6833150027417
7664. extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers	the range of micrometeorites	1178.5992095187669
7665. the approximate equation is f	where n	is the number of f with electron line-density greater than	or equal to f and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite	3326.2647506552157
7666. therefore n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed	and in fair agreement with the inverse 72 power derived from 1958 alpha	and 1959 eta data	4100.207149758241
7667. at the fifteenth magnitude f and at the twenty-fifth	magnitude f	503.91874598746745
7668. these extrapolated fluxes are about an order	of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the	figures in whipple's table	3479.9925409828675
7669. the extrapolation may be in error for	several reasons	261.120049104126
7670. the observational data determining the concentration	distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension	into the micrometeorite region	3267.1819243092305
7671. the solar-electromagnetic- and	corpuscular-radiation	pressure and the associated poynting-robertson effect	increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify	the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns	3337.4988862844484
7672. also	it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may	not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites	and the same distribution would not be expected	5619.9671633460775
7673. of micrometeorite flux	a measure of the total mass accretion	of meteoritic material by the earth is obtained from analyses of	deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions		2252.346481942553
7674. most meteoritic material by the time it reaches the earth's	surface has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material	in its passage through the atmosphere	4483.151969684919
7675. for all meteorites the average	nickel content is about 2	374.2916265451047
7676. this is much higher than the	nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis	for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx	3887.817513255125
7677. present data	indicate an accretion of about f tons per year over the entire globe	or about f	1581.0046843882008
7678. biological warfare is the intentional use of	living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying	or reducing the military effectiveness of man	3895.367981652535
7679. it is the exploitation	of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific	research and development resulting in the production of bw	weapons systems	2585.9701916053446
7680. man may also be injured secondarily by damage to	his food crops or domestic animals	1647.288074522823
7681. biological warfare is considered	to be primarily a strategic weapon	375.97391772688405
7682. the major reason for this	is that it has no quick-kill effect	959.3510522426297
7683. the incubation period of infectious	disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect	render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter	2468.452418010643
7684. a man	can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period	of most infectious diseases	1892.9400360858563
7685. thus an enemy would probably use this weapon	for attack on static population centers such as large cities	1569.9504813338224
7686. an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would	be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area	3492.4719828139714
7687. this	concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of	particulate biological materials the pathogenesis of respiratory infections	the medical management of such diseases and defense against their	occurrence	3227.915538271959
7688. the biological and physical properties of infectious	particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen	years	2135.9030842736634
7689. much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed	for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols	of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional	characteristics	3104.146706578963
7690. much information has been gathered relative to quantitative	sampling and assesment techniques	956.9488444889299
7691. much of the older experimental	work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial	procedures	1092.7091366455927
7692. the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious	agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure	through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms	3878.864526783456
7693. the	importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated	642.4026367084562
7694. the natural anatomical and physiological defensive features	of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and	the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging	out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily	existence	7002.956567367835
7695. very small particles however in a size range of 1 to	4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers	and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs	3203.4124809869004
7696. this area is highly susceptible	to infection	140.7132917514552
7697. the entrance and retention of infectious particles	in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation	1254.0033603410925
7698. the	relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated	in table 1	1184.5020715536102
7699. in considering bw defense it must be recognized	that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for	an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect	2577.156413835853
7700. for example bright sunlight	is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air	1182.5959802810742
7701. there	are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne	370.82000218447
7702. neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a	cloud to travel along the surface	1655.8875118660712
7703. it will rise during lapse conditions	43.26438816649161
7704. there are of course certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle	when most of these conditions will be met	2590.7670179595925
7705. certain other properties	of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in	connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy	in defense considerations	2584.573765879445
7706. the smaller the particle the further it will	travel downwind before settling out	1183.2907947278086
7707. an aerosol of such small particles	43.425972726477355
7708. moreover diffuses through structures in much the same manner as	a gas	962.5539285099433
7709. there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion	through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens	restaurants food stores hospitals etc	2470.3815579752245
7710. depending on the organism	there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products ie	in milk for example	2587.796416532043
7711. the secondary consequences from this could	be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for	defense	1725.8648796804657
7712. something of the behavior of clouds of small particles	can be illustrated by the following field trials:   in the	first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling	some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological	conditions	6319.234158721067
7713. zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were	disseminated	634.038230876263
7714. this material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which	facilitates its sampling and assessment	961.7993464697581
7715. four hundred and fifty pounds	was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156	miles	1410.4087042939786
7716. figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial	393.89615904704226
7717. the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles	502.8781065777619
7718. from these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000	square miles was covered	2348.259126182072
7719. these dosages could have been increased	by increasing the source strength which was small in this case	1409.3005270228064
7720. the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated	by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism	3509.0808253521473
7721. an aqueous suspension of the spores of b subtilis var	niger generally known as bacillus globigii was aerosolized	using commercially available nozzles	2172.867845942207
7722. a satisfactory cloud was produced	even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in	producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns	4829.444954516159
7723. in this	test 130 gallons of a suspension having a count of f organisms	per ml or a total of approximately f spores was aerosolized	2595.680666493029
7724. the	spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval	vessel cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze	3698.2176325779415
7725. spraying continued along a two-mile course	43.57926574871292
7726. this operation	was started at 5:00 pm and lasted for 29 minutes	958.4875689610797
7727. there was	a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative	humidity	1095.353539693962
7728. a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore	750.8301528939919
7729. these	were located at the homes of government employees in government	offices buildings and reservations within the trial area	1731.8562925814063
7730. a rough	attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by	taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth	floors of a government office building	5195.465087569535
7731. all samplers were	operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated	for four hours	1572.8644117434364
7732. in this instance there was a dosage of 562 during the	first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period	a four-fold increase	4286.90033190726
7733. this suggests that the sampling period particularly	at the more distant locations should have been increased	1257.3618735560112
7734. as can be seen from figure 2 an extensive area was covered by this	aerosol	1651.7457333409027
7735. the maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source	376.59735617034573
7736. as can be seen from these dosage isopleths approximately 100 square	miles was covered within the area sampled	2365.8300359766918
7737. it is quite likely that	an even greater area was covered particularly downwind	786.8549070372233
7738. the dosages	in the three levels of the vertical profile were: f   this was	not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description	of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol	4994.4278611572
7739. a number of unique medical	problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious	agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal	of entry	3088.5554764360086
7740. some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious	to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle	size than by the natural portal	4477.636120322571
7741. botulinal toxin for example is several	thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os	1423.3569107327726
7742. in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from	this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult	2360.3101448212647
7743. in tularemia produced	by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical	ulcer of rabbit fever on a finger	2032.5949540921022
7744. an enemy would obviously	choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious	1414.4190215103044
7745. agents	that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers	such as those causing q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders	coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category	2727.465072875276
7746. an agent	would	likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence	stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements	2840.9595696940364
7747. it	is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property	788.093667036317
7748. in this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without	excessive destruction	1174.361502436132
7749. moreover it should not be so fastidious in	its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant	scale improbable	2028.6509594201223
7750. an aggressor would use an agent against	which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced	immunity in a target population	3262.615065858699
7751. a solid immunity is the one effective	circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized	1423.1093619234732
7752. it must be remembered however that there are many agents for which	there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be	broken by an appropriate dose of agent	5164.263256412638
7753. there is a broad spectrum	of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose	might be made	1570.8031767905393
7754. an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism	a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality	2828.4649860281493
7755. it is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced	such as antibiotic resistant strains	1097.8771618959865
7756. mutants may also be developed	with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in	identification	1871.9003223018292
7757. all of these considerations are of critical importance	in considering defense and medical management	941.8774955914596
7758. biological agents	are of course highly host-specific	140.41686582248082
7759. they do not destroy physical	structures as is true of high explosives	641.5572932339649
7760. this may be of overriding	importance in considering military objectives	558.0727610694312
7761. the question	of epidemic disease merits some discussion	168.75565789626253
7762. only a limited effort has	been devoted to this problem	560.7287870939883
7763. some of those who question the value	of bw have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment	of epidemics	2173.5627765113186
7764. they then point out that with our present lack	of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall	of epidemics it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated	5319.745171442793
7765. they argue further that our knowledge	and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control	such an outbreak of disease	2176.089220071882
7766. this is why this approach to bw	defense has not been given major attention	1407.165646734866
7767. our major problem	is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target	1258.7641964110223
7768. this	of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose	agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease	2588.8714860048435
7769. a hypothetical	example will illustrate this point	93.76278514388034
7770. let us assume that it would	be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent	of epidemic typhus over city a and	that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom	5905.021187382843
7771. no epidemic	was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city	a was not lousy	1414.4376739325194
7772. lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus	140.78107992795876
7773. in this case then the military objective was accomplished with	an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial	attack	2185.4027945705816
7774. this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic	957.2573300774551
7775. on the other hand a similar attack might have been made on city	b whose population was known to be lousy	2025.629319497389
7776. one might expect some	spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness	of the attack	2350.0031544385374
7777. the major defensive problems are concerned	with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from	appropriate disseminating devices	1878.4076118092296
7778. it should be no more difficult	to deliver such devices than other weapons	1181.1588934250726
7779. the same delivery vehicles-	whether they be airplanes submarines or guided missiles- should	be usable	1097.800871190167
7780. if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on	a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent	over that city	4838.891609770503
7781. biological agents are moreover suitable	for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense	1253.9278248717662
7782. a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned	745.0157849091336
7783. the air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are	subject to attack	783.8303132561061
7784. america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses	processed precooked and even predigested foods	1420.6506416024345
7785. this is an enormous	industry that is subject to sabotage	374.64510924261253
7786. one must include the preparation	of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products	1897.080538036101
7787. huge	industries are involved also in the production of biological products	drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack	2179.8700812929824
7788. a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation	and study of blood group antibodies	1889.8454325237958
7789. these include low-temperature	ethanol fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and	column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses	941.3925230185583
7790. modifications of	the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators	1174.1335069364377
7791. abelson and rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated	whole sera containing abo and rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl	deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose	2342.446446595761
7792. speer	and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole	sera used a series of gradients for elution from deae-cellulose	3471.574869431667
7793. fahey and morrison used a single continuous gradient at constant	ph for the fractionation of anti-a and anti-b agglutinins	from preisolated |g-globulin samples	2329.39765934859
7794. in the	present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on	deae-cellulose	using single gradients similar to those described	by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological properties	of the fractions containing antibodies of the abo and rh	systems have been described	6838.600901717883
7795. serum samples were obtained from normal group a group b	and group o donors	955.6484012744835
7796. three of the anti-rh sera used were taken	from recently sensitized individuals	957.9945396812096
7797. one contained complete antibody	and had a titer of 1:512 in saline	640.9425430957111
7798. the second contained incomplete	antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by	the indirect coombs test	2592.0094627251083
7799. the third containing the mixed type of complete	and incomplete antibodies had titers of 1:256 in saline 1:512	in albumin and 1:1024 by the indirect coombs test	2858.7992281542656
7800. in addition	one serum was obtained from a donor who had been sensitized	6 years previously	1885.7047157378595
7801. this serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin	and 1:256 by the indirect coombs test	1098.1231556819314
7802. these antibody titers	serological	anti-a and anti-b activities were determined	in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o	donors by the following tube agglutination methods	4857.539045064209
7803. one drop of each	sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group f or	group b red cells in a small f test tube	2992.5167991971693
7804. in several instances	group o cells were also used as controls	753.6564858953509
7805. the red cells were used	within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline	before use	1861.511462088151
7806. the mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed	to stand at room temperature for 1 hr	2104.3997710331414
7807. the tubes were then	centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for	agglutination	1255.042067752002
7808. for the albumin method equal volumes of 30% bovine	albumin sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to	stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000	rpm for 1 min	5899.019794338386
7809. all samples were tested by both the saline and	albumin methods	504.8271107806583
7810. the activities of fractions of sera containing rh	antibodies were tested by the saline albumin and indirect coombs	techniques	2590.133560489487
7811. homozygous and heterozygous f cells f and homozygous	and heterozygous f cells were used to test each sample; however	in the	interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with	homozygous f and homozygous f cells will be presented here	4302.8791401980425
7812. the saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the abo	samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37`c	before centrifugation	4088.6251018174057
7813. the saline tubes were saved and used	for	the indirect coombs test in the following manner	1257.6687627114504
7814. the cells were washed	three times with saline anti-human serum was added the cells were	resuspended and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min	and examined for agglutination	4988.636341201256
7815. the anti-human sera used were prepared	by injecting whole human serum into rabbits	784.0852410997372
7816. those antisera shown	by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type were	selected for used in the present study	2817.73949320295
7817. the red cells for the	rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except	for the f cells which had been glycerolized and stored at -20`c	for approximately 1 year	3449.12128884857
7818. these cells were thawed at 37`c for 30	min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing	with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions		2354.1667737103617
7819. the cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended	to 2% in saline	1087.3494443020068
7820. blood samples were	allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuged and the	serum	was removed	2350.9370045814076
7821. the serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently	dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes	approximately 750 ml each of starting buffer	2962.2725021759547
7822. 6 was 0	0.30041514999999996

7824. 039 m in	tris-aminomethane		2.58856945057964
7825. after dialysis the sample was centrifuged	and the supernatant placed on a f cm column of eeae-cellulose	equilibrated with starting buffer	2031.2451781097207
7826. 78 meq of ng was prepared in our laboratory	by the method of peterson and sober from powdered cellulose 100-230	mesh	3068.900153336128
7827. the small amount of insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer	centrifuged resuspended in 2	2305.7526098764974
7828. 5 ml of isotonic saline and tested	for antibody activity	559.4184648588578
7829. the chromatography was done at 6`c	using gradient elution essentially according to sober and peterson	1111.7266653150355
7830. the deep concave gradient employed was obtained with	a nine-chambered gradient elution device	and has been described elsewhere	2369.056012514721
7831. the other a shallow concave	gradient was produced with a so-called cone-sphere	apparatus the cone being a 2-liter erlenmeyer flask	and the sphere a 2-liter round-bottom flask	2879.0295108568407
7832. each initially contained	1700 ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and	in the cone was final buffer 0	3032.6480080862775
7833. 50 m in both f and tris ph	4	261.6363359595599
7834. a flow rate of 72 f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected	1409.420623546193
7835. approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column	167.46052584475683
7836. these were read at 280 m|m in a beckman model du spectrophotometer	paper	electrophoresis	1408.2482752282424
7837. fractions from the	column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5`c	or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted	simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic	saline	3762.550216803817
7838. during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained	at 2`c by surrounding the apparatus with ice	1878.6587516358409
7839. because negative	pressure	dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection	of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler	procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments	3437.0707388802066
7840. paper	electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a spinco	model r cell using barbital buffer ph 8	2807.0460095513963

7843. when paper electrophoresis was to be	used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic	fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were runchamber	under the conditions described above	3449.6193802218577
7844. at the end of the run	the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried	stained for 1 hr washed and dried while the other strips were	maintained in a horizontal position at 1`c	6050.6789743850295
7845. the unstained strips	were	then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely	so as to separate the various protein bands	2477.318088527121
7846. the strip sections containing	a given protein were pooled eluted with 0	963.2864407182153
7847. 5 ml of isotonic	saline and the eluates were tested for antibody activity	785.6404505531711
7848. fractions from the column which were to be subjected	to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500	volumes of phosphate-buffered saline ph 7	5724.785498260257
7849. they were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min	at 20`c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration	of 1	2729.925493013316
7850. sedimentation coefficients were computed	as f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated	from the schlieren patterns	2808.9908173442027
7851. for preparative ultracentrifugation	fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less transferred to cellulose	tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline	3455.403499671555
7852. ultracentrifugation	was then carried out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at	40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min refrigeration being used throughout	the run	3901.1465697069775
7853. successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a	hypodermic syringe starting at the top of the tube and tested for agglutinin	activity	2315.641633080376
7854. other methods will be described below	65.43097057689546
7855. the insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin	activity regardless of the blood group of the donor	2313.3959306152365
7856. with either	of the gradients described chromatography on deae-cellulose	separated agglutinins of the abo series into at least three regions	: one of extremely low anionic binding capacity	one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding	capacity	4964.238591189639
7857. these have been labeled regions 1 2 and 4 respectively	in fig 1	792.015599224629
7858. when the early part of the gradient was flattened	either by using the gradient shown in fig 2 or by allowing the cone-sphere	gradient to become established more slowly region 2 activity	could sometimes be separated into two areas		4835.17243157538
7859. the latter	procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak between	regions 1 and 2	1258.0083951383174
7860. in 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of	agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected		1817.0274860251945
7861. moreover after concentration using negative	pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected	in the region designated 2a		984.6121427939968
7862. not all these regions exhibited equal	agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the	active areas	2588.755885820207
7863. in all cases most of the activity lay in the region of	high anionic binding capacity	1251.550179137026
7864. this was particularly noticeable in group	a and group b sera in which cases activity in regions 1	and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally	could not be detected at all	5607.2777425387485
7865. there appeared to be no difference	in the distribution of anti-a and anti-b activity in group	o serum though in two group o donors	only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic	binding capacity	4126.974569955056
7866. several samples of	citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by method 6 of cohn	et al	2121.106072484996
7867. these fractions were tested for abo agglutinin	activity using fractions from group ab plasma as a control	1423.6060264023095
7868. as expected most of the activity was found in fraction f with	slight activity seen in fraction 4-1	2348.6295912382275
7869. a sample of fraction f	from group o plasma was dissolved in starting buffer dialyzed against	this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown	in fig 2	3098.469215515958
7870. once again both anti-a and anti-b activities	were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis	1885.1087914814484
7871. similarly both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the	chromatographic eluate having extremely low low and high anionic	binding capacity respectively	2455.0760938319363
7872. chromatography of	whole sera revealed that the areas of rh antibody activity were generally	continuous and wide	2115.901419525816
7873. the incomplete antibody activity appeared	in the early part of the chromatogram; the complete in the latter	part	1569.0565228575933
7874. the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete	antibodies showed activity in both regions	1883.3440060009202
7875. in all cases	the activity against f cells was spread over a wider area than that	with f cells regardless of the type of test	used for comparison	2982.0444200965258
7876. the insoluble material resulting	from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity	1178.1724938599816
7877. in	fact agglutination of f cells in saline could be produced by the	insoluble material from sera containing only incomplete antibody	activity	2180.373307553318
7878. this was later known to be the result of concentrating the	minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera; when the insoluble	fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of	the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected	6996.964280524812
7879. apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees	hibernate in a state of torpor	1100.436507790058
7880. occasionally you may come across one	or two bumblebees in the cold season when you are turning over sods	in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them	at all	5783.583550894615
7881. they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their	bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well	mistake them for lumps of dirt	3091.489343270705
7882. i must add at once that these animals	are what we call queens young females that have mated in the previous	summer or autumn	3699.473379704154
7883. it is on them alone that the future of their	race depends for all their relatives	have perished with the arrival of the cold weather	2582.990027281459
7884. even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling	prey to enemies or disease	2372.372053431176
7885. the survivors emerge on some nice sunny	day in march or april when the temperature is close to 50` f	and there is not too much wind	2867.243167403193
7886. now the thing for us to do is to find	ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the	red ribes sanguineum of our pacific northwest or otherwise a	good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably	one with male or staminate catkins	7345.057178405131
7887. the blooms of ribes and of	the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects	will assemble: honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and	also various kinds of flies	3655.385691745573
7888. it is a happy buzzing crowd	65.98906824524343
7889. each	male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers	783.8223607100435
7890. it is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always	arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one	such pair standing on a green black-tipped little scale	5631.065814523151
7891. by scrutinizing	the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two	tiny warts	1421.8548732576214
7892. those are the nectaries or honey glands		65.5179024106029
7893. the staminate willow catkins then provide their visitors with	both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement for it provides	exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination	of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed	4541.997277411943
7894. the	only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites	957.0755577428699
7895. i	will deal with these later on	93.94529221790887
7896. quite often honeybees form a	majority on the willow catkins	567.7375914453855
7897. as we have already seen in the first	chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees	exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and	orange	2984.012754409767
7898. let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and	let us just call them bombus; there must be several dozen species	in the	united states alone	5156.997361000538
7899. if you really insist on knowing their names	an excellent book on the north american species is bumblebees and	their ways by o e plath	2604.8222357625823
7900. if we manage to keep track	of a bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may	discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself	when she woke up from her winter sleep	6180.568113818337
7901. as befits a queen a bumblebee	female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for	a suitable nesting place	2022.428758900247
7902. most species seem to prefer a ready-made	hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made	by a woodpecker; some show a definite liking for making their nest in	moss	5668.341341446373
7903. once she has made up her mind the queen starts out by constructing	in her chosen abode a small floor of dried grass or some	woolly material	2860.4572030663107
7904. on this she builds an egg compartment or egg	cell which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture	called beebread	2818.260687865529
7905. she also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills	with honey	793.9924117649994
7906. then a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the	beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed	2833.8237578721264
7907. the queen afterward	keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip	from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots	3115.405134250965
7908. when	the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive	extra honey meals from their mother	2597.006297968257
7909. she continues to add to the	pollen supply as needed	376.9406525491902
7910. the larvae kept warm by the queen	are full grown in about ten days	1400.3430216813097
7911. each now makes a tough papery cocoon	and pupates	264.26897164810697
7912. after another two weeks the first young emerge four	to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees	collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young	generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying	7028.326444232627
7913. the first	worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and mating females do not	emerge until later in the season	2184.4320689989217
7914. the broods of workers that appear	later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are	better fed	3028.263937094508
7915. by the middle of the summer many of the larvae apparently	receive such a good diet that it is optimal and it is then	that young queens begin to appear	3223.962371802523
7916. simultaneously males or drones are	produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a	few may be produced by the queen	3264.98708476871
7917. the young queens and drones leave the	nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilized	young	queens will begin to dig in for the winter	3108.4085904039202
7918. it is an amazing fact that	in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full	swing for instance in august	3679.030880741023
7919. the temperature then is still very	high	94.24363074100907
7920. at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay	the fertilized eggs that will produce females	3051.814398309455
7921. as a result the proportion	of males increases and eventually the old	colony will die out completely	1419.8688319295843
7922. the nest itself the structure that	in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its	peak is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain	beetles and moths	5329.836116864342
7923. not always though does the development of	a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described	1881.7140519877
7924. some members of the bee family have become idlers social parasites	that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives	2804.1388179476776
7925. bumblebees	can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of psithyrus the	cuckoo-bumblebee as it is called in some european countries	1883.3317651023735
7926. female individuals of psithyrus look deceptively like the workers	and queens of the bumblebees they victimize	1891.536671479469
7927. the one sure way to tell	victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the	case of the idler psithyrus lack the pollen baskets- naturally!	the female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest	of her host	4587.007677158502
7928. when she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively	to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the	bumblebees seal the egg compartment	4289.354267255285
7929. the hosts never seem to recognize	that something is amiss so that the compartment afterward is sealed	normally	1573.5898843613306
7930. thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense	of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread	2825.9973569257954
7931. later on they	and the mother psithyrus are fed by the bombus workers	793.9757768649323
7932. worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the psithyrus	female kills off the bombus queen	2808.9847684972488
7933. but let us return	after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring;	there are other wild bees that command our attention	2448.693331847332
7934. it	is almost certain that some of these usually a trifle smaller than the	honeybees are andrenas or mining bees	2832.8587731940734
7935. there are about 200 different	kinds of andrena in europe alone	498.5833439283626
7936. one of my favorites is a	armata a species very common in england where it is sometimes	referred to as the lawn bee	3494.355204685877
7937. the females like to burrow in the short	turf of well-kept lawns where their little mounds of earth often appear	by the hundreds	2318.1480434720015
7938. almost equal in size to a honeybee	141.25949759175995
7939. a armata	is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species:	a rich velvety rusty red	2033.31539421923
7940. the males are much duller	22.02994524779699
7941. after having mated an andrena female digs a hole straight down	into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil	2478.2457583745263
7942. the bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or cells	each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread	4291.906204293655
7943. the	development of the andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the	end of spring they have already pupated and become adults	2316.4321330761672
7944. but they	are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout	the summer fall and winter	2359.0893392335774
7945. their appearance next spring coincides	in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants	1412.1932781561165
7946. in the sacramento valley in california for instance it has been observed	that there was not one day's difference between the emergence	of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins	5172.588087606522
7947. this must be	due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and	the animal	1578.7761431422318
7948. after the male and female andrenas have mated	the cycle is repeated	966.3315980887694
7949. although andrena is gregarious so that we	may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call	it a solitary bee	2299.987227580118
7950. its life history is much simpler than that of the	truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life	cycle of many other species	4296.548192308411
7951. after all social life in the group of	the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking	feature	2192.32601283321
7952. on the basis of its life history we like to think that andrena	is more primitive than the bumblebees	2587.6367970475194
7953. the way in which it transports	its pollen is not so perfect either	785.4800745306468
7954. it lacks pollen baskets	and possesses only a large number of long branched hairs on its legs	on which the pollen grains will collect	3670.3434839567444
7955. still andrena will	do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks	like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind	3227.9831246072927
7956. closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees	759.0915532462209
7957. nomia	melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of	the united states west of the great plains for example in utah	and central washington	2858.3495936429863
7958. in the united states department of agriculture's	yearbook of agriculture 1952 which is devoted entirely	to insects george e bohart mentions a site in utah which	was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females	5298.482180535348
7959. often the burrows	are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres	1431.9372921556178
7960. the life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of andrena	but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer	and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage	5458.460208330818
7961. in most places	there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing	late in the summer	1721.5916698667424
7962. i must plead guilty to a special sympathy	for nomias	561.6994952086344
7963. this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington	but certainly i love to visit their mound cities near yakima and	prosser in july or august when the bees are in their most active	period	3955.5192830729525
7964. the name alkali bee indicates that one has to look for	them in rather inhospitable places	1877.3318313099342
7965. sometimes although by no means	always these are indeed alkaline	376.73541933861947
7966. the thing is that these bees love	a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should	not be stagnant either	3695.9222399674495
7967. where does	one find such conditions	43.358873823049564
7968. the best chance of course is offered by	gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and	where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits	which permit only sparse plant growth	6226.003790590754
7969. many other snakes at maturity are already more	than half their final length	787.096496523331
7970. laurence m klauber put length at maturity	at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes and charles	c carpenter's data on michigan garter and ribbon snakes	show that the smallest gravid females are more than	half as long as the biggest adults	6707.17995482988
7971. felix kopstein states that when	the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal	length but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception	with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity	4024.8493672379846
7972. it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow	appreciably after attaining maturity; he was working with species	of java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect	5620.3829692001145
7973. certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable	difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this	is due to captive conditions	2859.2315488848626
7974. additional records of slow growth have	been omitted	249.66093632889596
7975. it is possible to make a few generalizations about	the six giants themselves	789.6430426573269
7976. there seems to be a rough correlation	between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest	and ending with the largest	3281.7132835135644
7977. data on the	former are scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes	born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby	lending support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain	the greatest length	4530.789643182698
7978. for four of the six	there is also a correlation	between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor	being the smallest and the indian python the next in size at the	former stage	5645.789529814444
7979. let us speculate a little on the maximum size	of the anaconda	640.2363405029048
7980. if in a certain part of the range it starts life 1	foot longer than do any of the other giants and reaches	maturity at let us guess 18 inches longer than the others a	quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of	40 feet	7214.100769681723
7981. when it comes to rate of early growth the indian	python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the	first two years more or less	3335.1138932633867
7982. the african rock python a close second	is followed in turn by the reticulate python	1645.060572294861
7983. there are few data	on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda are unconvincing and	there is nothing at all on the amethystine python	2465.2549138232775
7984. it seems likely that	the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have	been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally	well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to	keep	6154.920608517212
7985. i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity	growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches	rather than feet	2847.2123112917707
7986. until better records have been kept over longer	periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions	it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions	4639.558748263516
7987. it is often	stated	that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but	this apparently is an overestimation	1889.7928605720888
7988. the best way to determine the	correct figure is by direct observation of pairs isolated	from birth a method that produced surprising results: maturing of	a male indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three;	data on the boa constrictor about match this	7228.357581580031
7989. another approach	is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at	maturity	1254.376653658679
7990. results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations:	about three years are required there being a possible slight	difference between males and females in the time required	4475.787874669715
7991. only the	amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity	of data	1256.7273337067595
7992. the following information on snakes varying greatly	in size shows when considered	with the foregoing that there is probably no correlation between	the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature	5622.006740388318
7993. oliver	in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states	could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition	to the rattlers which i shall consider separately	3758.522870880395
7994. these three	were much alike: lined snake one year and	nine months; red-bellied snake two years; cottonmouth	two years	2604.281483244963
7995. klauber investigated the rattlesnakes	carefully himself and also summarized what others have found	789.4794095107663
7996. he	concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types	females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young	when they are three	5009.186249418513
7997. other herpetologists have ascertained that in	the northern united states the prairie rattlesnake may not give first	birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may	be born every other year rather than annually	4217.168093416342
7998. carpenter's study	showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of michigan mature	at about the age of two	2575.6388873256797
7999. oversized monsters are	never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements	are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate	dimensions	2727.80005156184
8000. measurements of skins are of little value; every	snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching	presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer	4082.478042857798
8001. in	spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on	some of the giants	1573.9965846946106
8002. the anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment	but the reason for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions	still found in tropical south america might be responsible	4987.673574219089
8003. there are three levels on which to treat the subject	376.68418629300356
8004. the first is	the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may	err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh	3897.012360258529
8005. this	approach rejects virtually all field measurements	93.63340954578594
8006. the next level	attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion;	field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected	and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated	5496.484185634387
8007. the third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire	1103.142458433303
8008. the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which	rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves	into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people	out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove	to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes	or ghosts	8270.722579665215
8009. oliver has recently used the second-level approach	with the largest snakes and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda	reaches a length of at least 37 feet the reticulate python 33	the african rock python 25 the amethystine python at least 22 the indian	python 20 and the boa constrictor 18-12	5042.539819290656
8010. bernard heuvelmans	also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and	is chiefly concerned with the anaconda	2832.164748721774
8011. he reasons that as anacondas	30 feet long are often found some might be 38 and occasional monstrous	freaks over 50	2040.491691035215
8012. he rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more	249.72982363609125
8013. his thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents	with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his	picture not to be believed	2859.3949525909006
8014. detailed information on record	lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows	1649.548305699141
8015. of the six giants	discussions of the giants one by one will include	as far as possible data on these aspects of growth: size at which	life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached; time required	to reach maturity; rate of growth both before and after this crucial	stage; and maximum length with confirmation or amplification	of oliver's figures	5568.1552342414225
8016. definite information on the growth of senile	individuals is lacking	559.3950023587415
8017. at birth this species varies	considerably in size	166.4368348544677
8018. a brood of twenty-eight born at brookfield	zoo near chicago ranged in length from 22 to 33-12 inches and averaged	29 inches	3246.59106076893
8019. lawrence e griffin gives measurements of nineteen	young anacondas presumably members of a brood from south america;	the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit	of the brookfield brood and its average	3670.340632871231
8020. raymond l ditmars	had	two broods that averaged 27 inches	559.8329176165546
8021. r r mole and f w	urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood	of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuaries	2856.8402204412273
8022. william beebe	reports 26 inches and 2	140.82427144777347
8023. 4 ounces	for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana	1106.8640788695234
8024. in contrast ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two	young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches and four young were born in london	at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces	6423.760392225102
8025. beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9	259.87958772014457
8026. a difference	between subspecies might explain the great range in size	748.208905564681
8027. i have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth	372.29031446962347
8028. hans	schweizer had one that increased from 19-12 inches to 5 feet 3 inches	in five years and j j quelch records a growth of from less	than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years	5920.813657145116
8029. it is very unlikely that	either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate	1100.2565998363427
8030. in 1948	afranio do amaral the noted brazilian herpetologist wrote a	technical paper on the giant snakes	2147.2791613459317
8031. he concluded that the anaconda's	maximum length is 12 or 13 meters which would approximate	from 39 to 42 feet	1889.5720629986422
8032. thus	his estimate lies between oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet	and the 50-foot monstrous freaks intimated by heuvelmans	2810.282867111399
8033. the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in	eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond	oil company and reported in 1944 by emmett r dunn	3458.959085707588
8034. however	as a field measurement it is open to question	562.6477769786477
8035. oliver's 37-12	feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable	1100.979846099898
8036. however many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer	a tentative maximum of about 30 feet	1650.7983152945822
8037. it is possible that especially	large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to	a small area	1569.4987371761677
8038. in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic	of subspecies	746.533703787419
8039. a colombian female's brood	of sixteen boa constrictors born in the staten island zoo averaged	20 inches	1413.3186799894181
8040. this birth length seems to be typical	139.80799211950085
8041. when some thirteen	records of newly and recently born individuals are collated little	or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected	2319.3520637988195
8042. the	range is from 14 to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat	unusual birth of four by a central american female	the latter on a normal	newly born individual	5325.737332823896
8043. however as so many of the records are	not certainly based on newborn snakes these data must be taken tentatively;	final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods	from definite localities	3559.007951143456
8044. alphonse r hoge's measurements	of several very young specimens from brazil suggest that at birth the	female is slightly larger than the male	3488.864021615426
8045. i have surprisingly little	information on the size and age at maturity	642.419377463161
8046. carl kauffeld has	written to me of sexual activity in february 1943 of young born in march	1940	2350.8919185144364
8047. one female collected on an island off the coast of nicaragua	was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent		1575.4955437442964
8048. the female from central	america which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long	2108.98394207396
8049. what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation	in rate; unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual	whereas many have been made for a very short period of time	3555.827271922808
8050. the results are too varied to allow generalization	251.52124158072752
8051. the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close	relationship throughout	943.6609888156714
8052. the pulmonary vein however without the limiting	supportive tissue septa as in type 1 follows a more direct	path	to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship		3380.3668726045953
8053. another marked difference is noted here	43.553226928488066
8054. the pulmonary artery	in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole	the alveolar duct and the alveoli continues on and directly supplies	the thin pleura	4474.56087004696
8055. the bronchial artery except for a	small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the	pleural blood supply	2020.8036112180557
8056. it does as in type 1 supply the hilar lymph	nodes the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the	bronchioles- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary	artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole	6205.1899967831
8057. no bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses were noted in this group	371.91571514891245
8058. lung	type 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1	and 2	1422.2328258936327
8059. it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed	secondary lobules; well defined but haphazardly arranged interlobular	septa and a thick remarkably vascular pleura	2466.694929985272
8060. the	most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 being	composed of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional	poorly developed respiratory bronchioles	4090.297651744775
8061. in this	instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule does	not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung	as in type 1	2857.041062573072
8062. air-drifts from one area to another are therefore	conceivable	390.2193920545693
8063. distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery	on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type 1		1587.3515442759292
8064. this relationship however is not maintained centrally	141.7575971535535
8065. here the pulmonary vein as in type 2 is noted to draw away from	the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the	hilum	2867.948561068552
8066. the bronchial artery in its course and distribution	differs somewhat from that found in other mammals	1874.0561816671568
8067. as seen in	types 1 and 2 it supplies the hilar lymph nodes vasa vasorum	to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles	2869.429014838176
8068. as in type 1 it provides arterial blood to the interlobular	septa and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen		2010.0754863691811
8069. this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular	bronchial artery branches	791.7225489503469
8070. such a dual derivation was strikingly	demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling	would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once	4085.8570839943322
8071. some	of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the	bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches	following along the pleural surface	2732.0680071055417
8072. with completion of filling net-like	anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately	derived branches	1878.9986397899374
8073. an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries	present within the substance of the lung was noted	1559.5083139264952
8074. this was accounted	for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following	the pulmonary artery	2132.706349335257
8075. the diameter of this bronchial artery was	much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum	1561.5867099030681
8076. in distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that	of the pulmonary artery	1643.1286917404911
8077. this vessel could be followed to the parenchyma	where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar	capillary bed	1876.8874147602771
8078. also three other direct pathways	of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via the pleura;	through the interlobular septa; and along the terminal bronchiole		2531.0342580186402
8079. one bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar	anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level	640.5804289542461
8080. it is evident that many marked and striking differences	exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made	2360.231948051104
8081. the	significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence	of corresponding physiologic differences been determined	1728.686807721667
8082. however	the dynamics of airflow from morphologic considerations alone	may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse	2817.1754612338673
8083. the volume	and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood	flow might be different in the dog than in the horse	2173.7321376375858
8084. also interlobular	air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably occur	in the horse much as in the human being; and in contrast are present	to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where	lobules are absent	6806.301365258599
8085. a reason	for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking	at present	1098.0323346264813
8086. within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function	and if one is permitted to speculate potential pathology should	be included in this statement as well	3685.935912700063
8087. for example the marked susceptibility	of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its	delicate long alveolar ducts and short large bronchioles situated	within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue	barriers such as those found in types 1 and 3	4529.257523322662
8088. one might also	wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know	it in man or the horse	2838.7584998357756
8089. in addition it would be difficult to imagine	chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow considering its marked	lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this	occurring in the horse or the dog	3654.4633342612724
8090. anatomically the horse lung	appears to be remarkably like that of man insofar as this can be ascertained	from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of	others in the human being	5461.01858469176
8091. the only area in which	one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar	distribution of the bronchial arteries	2456.812483339108
8092. as early as 1858 le	fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human	beings	2109.6747822409625
8093. in 1951 this was reaffirmed by cudkowicz	94.09400544115236
8094. the opposition	to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of miller		1126.625244010321
8095. apparently however miller has relied heavily on the	anatomy in dogs and cats and he has been criticized for using pathologic	human material in his normal study	2871.8662330540956
8096. although miller	noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed	between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he	did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian	lungs other than in the dog and cat	6897.690994967263
8097. the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial	artery as found in the horse is not clear	1728.5613368984166
8098. however this artery is known	to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal	airways and supportive tissues of the lung	3694.0904351545614
8099. the alveoli and respiratory	bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues	261.89956571441655
8100. theoretically they	are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding	air or from pulmonary arterial	blood	2603.1870545243023
8101. therefore an explanation of this alveolar	bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased	amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffusing in nature	in the region of the alveolus	3437.984119884228
8102. if this be true the possibility exists	that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread	degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized	emphysema	4641.936620659127
8103. one would not expect such an event to occur in animals	possessing lungs of types 1 or 2	1574.8407924438184
8104. the presence of normally	occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first	noted in 1721 by ruysch and thereafter by many others	3042.9436979682123
8105. nakamura	verloop von	hayek have all claimed their normal but	relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being	1405.9497165324965
8106. miller	is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint	250.56548678188247
8107. in criticism of the latter's	views his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies	in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution	under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored	particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level	4661.485228462457
8108. as early as 1913	ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs	that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level	when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that	increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative	drop in pulmonary artery pressure	7781.375682609573
8109. berry brailsford and daly	in 1931 and nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this	641.7553114944942
8110. our own studies in which	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated	were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure	on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by injecting the pulmonary	artery and vein afterwards	6045.952906725787
8111. it is distinctly possible therefore	that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered	the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable	2027.3533740593134
8112. this viewpoint is further	supported by verloop's demonstration of thickened bronchial	artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting	as valves	3474.7608007305985
8113. in other words the anastomoses between the bronchial artery	and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand	shunts	1886.5394330043316
8114. in addition little work has been done on a comparative	basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses	3275.807613198089
8115. verloop found these shunts	in the human being but was unable to find them in rats	1244.0202317474736
8116. ellis grindlay	and edwards also were unable to find them in rats	954.9687733298381
8117. nakamura	was unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic	or physiologic methods in dogs	1097.6094404873847
8118. the possibility that the absence	or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred	1655.9242618937071
8119. certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one	or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that	species	2310.5174261169786
8120. it is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own	findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially	the dog	4997.846401805558
8121. in conclusion these findings suggest the need for	a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs	1406.4077978649307
8122. in addition a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized	pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent	2830.6502624179348
8123. also for the present great caution should be exercised in the	choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to	be applied to man	2849.2208537422057
8124. this is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are	to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man	3483.9729859446416
8125. finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be	anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently	known species	2842.3600720857185
8126. the main subgross anatomical features	of the lungs of various mammals are presented	1174.3365118322893
8127. a tabulation of these	features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross	types	1258.067222597182
8128. type 1 is represented by the cow sheep and pig;	type 2 by the dog cat and monkey; type 3 by the horse	3484.45392236271
8129. lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1; absent in type	2; imperfectly developed in type 3	1412.6320090071215
8130. the pleura and interlobular	septa are thick in types 1 and 3	962.285109814866
8131. the pleura is extremely	thin in type 2 and septa are absent	641.42723108158
8132. arterial supply to the pleura	in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery and	in type 2 by the pulmonary artery	3709.111103419098
8133. in types 1 2 and 3	the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common	with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole	2984.790938037909
8134. in	type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the	alveolar capillary bed	1644.6059307610092
8135. true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent	form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 although	small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present	2983.0893514429345
8136. well developed respiratory bronchioles on the other hand appear	to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2	3268.592773858648
8137. in	type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus	and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum	2345.883677584475
8138. this maybe	due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present	748.2386392271436
8139. in	type 3 this general relationship is maintained peripherally but	not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path	to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2	3681.7480630005034
8140. some of the features of the top portions of figure 1 and figure	2 were mentioned in discussing table 1	2803.527345714746
8141. first the onset profile	spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls	1264.0682218739844
8142. in contrast 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile	are bunched and extend over a	much shorter period approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for	girls	4847.519964054583
8143. the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that	onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion	is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence	3113.8669965024847
8144. second for	both sexes the 21 transverse lines in the onset profile vary more	in individual spread than those in the completion profile	3494.0013196633545
8145. although	the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based	are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early	there are considerable differences in this value between	centers having the closely timed onsets	4024.6192005230114
8146. third the process of calcification	is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these	boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of	children	5167.8018993782425
8147. the onset profile and completion profile are constructed	to serve as norms for children	945.2345678595968
8148. it is convenient to classify	a child's onset ages and completion ages as advanced moderate	or delayed according to whether the child's	age equivalent dots appeared to the left of upon or	to the right of the appropriate short transverse line	6423.347401223468
8149. when a dot	appears close to the end of the transverse line the moderate	rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot	with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age	3856.0700989244783
8150. such classifications	may be called somewhat advanced or somewhat delayed	as the case may be reserving moderate for dots upon or close	to the mean	3859.358331361167
8151. in the lower portion of each chart the skeletal	age of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified	1883.2192390252033
8152. there the middle one of the three curves denotes mean skeletal age	for the maturity series boys and girls	2610.373493598595
8153. the upper curve denotes	the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents	the mean minus one standard deviation	2046.1625520254613
8154. thus a child's skeletal	age dots may be classified as advanced when they appear above	the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above	or below the middle curve and delayed when they appear below	the lower curve	6032.328381197556
8155. to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity	chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which	show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level	of growth centers	3206.931453682877
8156. first the upper portion requires series of films	for every child consisting of those from hand elbow shoulder knee	and foot	3039.803693180634
8157. the lower portion necessitates only films of hand	165.5028166855535
8158. second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an	equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones	of the five regions	4283.4279584201995
8159. the lower portion permits comparison of maturity	levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones	are included in hand and wrist as a region	2982.8972900708145
8160. third the upper portion	deals with only two indicators of developmental level onset and	completion	1650.7356597704588
8161. the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate	maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset	and completion	2173.7125885295764
8162. fourth the two indicators are for the most part	widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring	during childhood for all but one growth center	4089.496398861328
8163. the lower portion provides	a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood	789.9964489364888
8164. onsets	completions and skeletal ages of boy 34 and girl 2	may be directly compared and classified using only those skeletal ages	which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion	profile	5353.148109798304
8165. it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection	of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small	according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for	centers throughout the body	4038.2551730796245
8166. accordingly maturity level ratings by	means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively	should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessments are dependent	upon onsets during infancy and upon completions during adolescence	5775.562092052213
8167. it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but	there is substantial agreement	1256.8801115167084
8168. since a skeletal age rating can	be made at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot	as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes	to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood	6788.3243367308605
8169. as stated earlier in the paper onsets and completions-	particularly the former- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy	in osseous development each within a limited age period	3120.7011942604886
8170. such	an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific	periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress	2595.8644660413893
8171. it	was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis	of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth	centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and	2	4195.951640662968
8172. as one approach to doing this figures 3 and 4 have been constructed	from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for	boy 34 and girl 2	4841.06910431787
8173. the differences between onset age and completion age	with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition	by means of a series of arrows	2868.97434038165
8174. the data for boy 34 appear	in figure 3 and for girl 2 in figure 4	1883.4565284998826
8175. the numbering system used	in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth	centers	2035.9050569838469
8176. the dot on one end of each arrow indicates	extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the	corresponding mean age for the growth center	4458.7570061325805
8177. the tip of the	arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion	age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center	2324.878173089966
8178. thus the	alignment of the dots and tips respectively indicate individual	variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect	to the mean values for these boys and girls	5000.369908220952
8179. the direction in which	the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was	changed at completion from the level at onset	2597.6678560734827
8180. when the dot	and tip coincide the classification used in this paper is same	schedule	1650.232183210722
8181. the length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or	acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference	in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale	along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the	original data in the appropriate tables	5133.4791889469625
8182. the difference between	the sequence of onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering	sequence in figures 3 and 4	3030.1838036179606
8183. this difference is readily clarified	by referring to table 1	370.4666848611902
8184. for example arrow 17 in figure 3 portrays	the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 whereas the same epiphysis	for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in figure 4	4832.496961554365
8185. for the boy	this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion	1251.9872417267732
8186. thus the span of its ossification was shortened and the center's	ability to catch up in ossification is demonstrated	2598.9297093679825
8187. in	contrast for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at onset	and delayed at completion	1257.5012153670095
8188. obviously the slowing for her may have	occurred at any point between onset and completion	1633.6554063391868
8189. the skeletal	age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that slowing may have	occurred for her during the prepubescent period	2315.844548435288
8190. length of the shaft	of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation	values for each center in table 1	3253.0692287573315
8191. we have attempted to simplify	the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of	each child- more than 1700 values for the entire group- by constructing	figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34	boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center	5259.270605099586
8192. figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for	each growth center	2128.46831768876
8193. forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the	original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this	monograph have been included in the appendix	3215.9637574282274
8194. the principles	used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the	construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the appendix	4816.7427010086785
8195. one growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the second	finger- was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because	epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion	in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the	menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage	5085.571641620393
8196. its completion	thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include	in studies of growth dietary patterns and health during adolescence	3249.6440993875867
8197. the following summary based on figures 5 and 6 is an	example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset	ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the	appropriate mean age for each growth center	4293.337160078559
8198. at the top of figure 5	for example the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen	growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and	standard deviation values in table 1	5751.703177221921
8199. the 34 arrows denoting onset	age plus completion age deviations have been arrayed in an onset	sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the	34 girls	3348.803577939895
8200. the growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the	second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones	3900.450538031896
8201. the mean onset age was 25	43.69833374993555
8202. 3 months and the average	span of the osseous stage was 133 months	1178.176890954926
8203. the correlation	between onset age and completion age was +	128.06242341297127
8204. 50 and that between onset	age and span was -	191.04685829525107
8205. with due consideration for the limits of precision	in assessing expected rate of change in ossification of girls age	2 years and the known variations in rate of ossification of these	children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement each	arrow with a shaft length of four months or less was selected as	indicating same schedule at onset and completion for this particular	epiphysis	5787.319880775779
8206. accordingly girls 31 29 33 21 26 13 3 4	14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be said to have the same	schedule at onset and completion	5332.375217035656
8207. it seems clear from	the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in figure 5 that	there was about an equal number of early and late onsets and completions	for the 34 girls	3558.787922827235
8208. accordingly if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion	occurs in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might	have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification	for the 18 girls with same schedule	5469.837272157159
8209. as an example of the interpretation	of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft	length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had	a delayed onset and further delayed completion	3941.2166262121345
8210. it is of interest	that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls	in this group	2569.928404026888
8211. a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boys	would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value	of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage	3346.6535244652455
8212. boys 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 had same schedule at onset	and completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage	would appear possible for only seven boys	4851.797080023373
8213. boy 34 like girl 2 did not	have same schedule; his arrow crosses the line denoting the	mean	1561.9935412224286
8214. the dot on his arrow indicates early onset and the tip	indicates relatively later completion	1638.081119077441
8215. after the 42 figures	had been drawn like figures 5 and 6 classifications of the onset	ages and completion ages were summarized from them	2457.767615866088
8216. interestingly enough the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited	by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and	b	3269.249063875167
8217. organification	the precise mechanism for organification of iodine	in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood	1418.6797680626282
8218. however the formation	of organically bound iodine mainly mono-iodotyrosine can be	accomplished in cell-free systems	1641.2261341967278
8219. in the absence of additions to the	homogenate the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein	and kirkwood 1953; taurog potter and chaikoff 1955;	taurog potter tong and chaikoff 1956; serif and kirkwood		2661.1159288669314
8220. this iodoprotein does not	appear	to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there	is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro	by cell-free systems	5463.1329942776665
8221. in addition the iodoamino acid formed in largest	quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine	1103.9788375728915
8222. if tyrosine	and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate	of the thyroid large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can	be formed	3898.842257223241
8223. it is not clear whether this system	bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system	generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue	2985.5469922711954
8224. on chemical	grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to	f and then to f as the active iodinating species	3471.921718331533
8225. in the thyroid	gland it appears that proteins are iodinated	and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated	1721.122120442539
8226. iodination of	tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone	955.4962188940592
8227. the mono-	and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and	thyroxine	643.0942077173565
8228. the mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail	with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain	di-iodotyrosine analogues	3706.8269797647918
8229. there	is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is	under enzymatic control	1252.0044154557054
8230. the chemical nature of the iodocompounds	is discussed below	391.16082337724526
8231. little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of	thyroglobulin	501.966626242972
8232. its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems	nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in	vitro been unequivocally proven	3694.875986230615
8233. there is some reason to think that thyroglobulin	synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in	certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially	no iodinated thyroglobulin a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin	has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments		3394.3172080767013
8234. similar findings have been noted in a patient with	congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue	could only concentrate iodide	3254.101938394252
8235. in addition depending on availability	of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of	iodine	1094.7587146033015
8236. since the circulating thyroid hormones are	the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine	it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their	release from proteins before secretion	5005.004487169685
8237. the presence of several proteases	and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid	795.7187080164625
8238. one of	the proteases has ph optimum of about 3	560.7524120443098
8239. 7 and another of about 5	43.37021533596781
8240. the finding that the concentration of one of these proteases	is increased in thyroid glands from tsh-treated animals suggests	that this protease may be active in vivo	4304.8108339605515
8241. there is no conclusive	evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly	purified form nor is their specificity known	2313.336294984935
8242. a study of their activity	on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released	and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation	of macromolecular intermediates	4282.0737547354975
8243. besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes	168.34651260073446
8244. a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 and requiring	reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity has been	identified in the thyroid	3494.0642982588724
8245. this de-iodinating enzyme	is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine but does not de-iodinate	thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine	1257.8394955367512
8246. it is assumed that the iodine released	from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid	where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin	4115.869151073069
8247. the thyroxine	and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping	de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream	1412.2673009407736
8248. it has been	shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine but the binding does not appear	to be particularly strong	2351.165001864664
8249. it has been suggested that the plasma	thyroxine-binding proteins which have an extremely high affinity for	thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine		1457.997598461196
8250. antithyroid drugs are of two	general types	141.2188955442063
8251. one type has a small univalent anion of the	thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoroboride	type	505.2794541482516
8252. this ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis	by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid	1416.4754146102773
8253. it does	not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such	501.5429649172803
8254. the other	group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil	960.6414234243896
8255. these	drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism but they	inhibit organification	937.5461955124541
8256. the mechanism of action of these drugs has not	been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing	the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin		3835.7778125466916
8257. on the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs	of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing	activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular	iodine	3546.0719206575
8258. any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given	in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing	to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism	5460.750584248508
8259. the anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased	output of tsh causing the thyroid to enlarge	1737.9971558970053
8260. the effect	of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted	by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet	3668.2695905510686
8261. the antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type however are not antagonised	by such means	937.6846141327654
8262. besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol	types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring	foods	2359.496292561317
8263. the most conclusively identified is l-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone	which was isolated from rutabaga	507.03206460677467
8264. it is presumed	to occur in other members of the brassica family	954.1930592349439
8265. there is some	evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development	of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia		1443.3894980781713
8266. there it seems that the goitrogen ingested by	dairy	animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active	goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk	4831.483052959562
8267. besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of	iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity	of the thyroid gland	2977.124653018191
8268. in the experimental animal and in man gross	deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and	increased thyroid activity		1836.0659326931077
8269. in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary	to prevent development of goitre is about 100 |mg per day	2597.8407258546313
8270. with	lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow	enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake	of iodine	3483.4125912234076
8271. further the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction	of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally	1259.8932375271424
8272. in the presence of	a low iodine intake thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with f is found	to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amounts of di-iodotyrosine	and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced	5017.470012563058
8273. this appears	to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more	rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin	2181.615251945178
8274. if the deficiency	persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the f label	will reflect the f distribution in the thyroglobulin	3472.899918868357
8275. similar results	might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions	that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin	proteolysis	2323.242593087875
8276. the	name thyroid-stimulating hormone has been given to a substance	found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so	far	tested for its presence	4265.921563153255
8277. the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin	or thyrotrophic hormone	373.1000223330448
8278. at the present time we do not know by what	biochemical mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid but for bio-assay	of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity	may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase	in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cells	and increase in the thyroidal uptake of f	8476.28420475536
8279. here we shall restrict	discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise	for determining the concentration of tsh in blood	2168.773579170337
8280. brown	has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying tsh	and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on	the subject	3698.1646565185933
8281. tsh	as long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by niepce	that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid	2319.951913680966
8282. this connection was clarified by smith and smith who showed	that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate	the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles	4087.2079966586252
8283. the first attempts	to isolate tsh came a decade later when janssen and loeser	used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh	from insoluble impurities	2607.6622110195576
8284. after their work other investigators applied	salt-fractionation techniques to the problem as well as fractionation	with organic solvents such as acetone	3050.772247423455
8285. albert has concluded	that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period	from 1931 to 1945 were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent	as the starting material	3334.1450606412095
8286. much of this work has been reviewed by	white	392.9421661222971
8287. developments up to about 1957 have	been discussed by sonenberg	374.8660066716447
8288. in the last few years	the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the	problem of isolating tsh has led to further purification		2537.618011459152
8289. the most	active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators	appear to be similar in potency composition and physical properties	2037.7663103347063
8290. two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in	blood	556.2626214136831
8291. first is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that	found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored	2189.046507673382
8292. second what	is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances	will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction	3706.6333461141285
8293. it is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary	tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood	tsh is to be discussed rationally	2472.2925533164
8294. the importance of knowing in	what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent	observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting tsh in	blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients	5135.395768026337
8295. whether this	abnormal tsh differs chemically from pituitary tsh or	is alternatively normal tsh with its period of effectiveness	modified	by some other blood constituent cannot be decided without chemical	study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison	of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary	tsh	5201.854262455563
8296. in evaluating data on the concentration of tsh	in blood one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used	to obtain them	3043.025448701758
8297. the introduction of the united states pharmacopoeia	reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the	usp and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have	made it possible to compare results published by different investigators	since that time	4107.746975405219
8298. we should like to re-emphasise the importance of	stating results solely in terms of international units of tsh activity	and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units	4268.176701049003
8299. for	the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since	a	944.0508717310937
8300. standard preparations	the international	unit	adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different	laboratories has been defined as the	amount of activity present in 13	4284.033403040356
8301. 5 mg of the international standard	preparation	93.91028971868018
8302. the international unit is equipotent with the usp	unit adopted in 1952 which was defined as the amount of activity	present in 20 mg of the usp reference substance	4633.942888178583
8303. muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though	serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic	adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use	2458.399525144053
8304. although biopsies have	shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced	weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which	necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle	groups	5929.307237902863
8305. the case described in this paper is that of an older man	who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of	steroids for a refractory anemia	2842.289955236728

8341. in spite of normal thyroid function tests a trial of propylthiouracil	400 mg daily for one week was given but served only	to intensify muscle weakness	2739.5563227179487
8342. repeated attempts to withdraw steroids	entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted	as well as fever malaise anorexia anxiety and an exacerbation of	the anemia	4094.960582329054

8439. _specificity	of staining in the first few experiments	f was passed through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed	twice with 50-100 mg sweet clover tissue powder	2449.3414095681446
8440. the intermediate	sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder	558.0680511958342
8441. sections of sweet	clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1:10 solution of f	for 30 minutes washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes stained with	f for 30 minutes and washed for 15 minutes in pbs	4022.5882479429465
8442. such sections	showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells	of the pseudophloem tissue	1411.4608683917702
8443. this specific fluorescence	was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence	in consecutive sections stained with 1:10 dilution of ns	and f or with f alone	2858.7506672392346
8444. unstained sections mounted in buffered	glycerine or sections treated only with ns or f did not show	such green fluorescence	2824.2658863335364
8445. sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained	with either f and f or ns and f also showed only the light	green nonspecific fluorescence	2469.5672369653657
8446. however the nonspecific staining	by the f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused	with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen	4053.478091644003
8447. two absorptions of f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of f	ns and f with	crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder did not further improve	the specificity of staining	3423.951224923815
8448. treatment of all the sera with sweet	clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence especially when	the treated conjugate was diluted to 1:2 with 0	3694.857106508188
8449. in	all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were diluted to	1:10 or 1:100 with 0	1409.174960683028
8450. 85% saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence	were not appreciably reduced whereas a dilution of the intermediate	sera to 1:500 or diluting the f to 1:5 greatly reduced	specific fluorescence	4843.362714712943
8451. rinsing the sections with pbs before	layering	the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction	1262.0197387420912
8452. in addition	to other treatments treating the sections with normal sheep serum	for half an hour before layering f did not reduce nonspecific staining	3672.5903058696013
8453. the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could	be satisfactorily	removed was by passing the conjugate through a deae-cellulose	column	1874.86430082802
8454. when 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column	the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the	most	specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and	very little in others	5463.316120718538
8455. in the latter cases an additional treatment of	the deae-cellulose-treated f with 50 mg of sweet clover stem	tissue powder further improved the specificity	2453.730520452483
8456. after these treatments	the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues	or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable	from the bright yellow-green specific staining	5168.417382225009
8457. with this purified	conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections	with 1:10 dilution of f for 30 minutes washing with pbs	for 15 minutes staining with f for 30 minutes and washing with	pbs for 15 minutes	4211.721381422707
8458. the specificity of staining in wtv tumors	with f and f but not with ns and f or with antiserum to	potato yellow-dwarf virus and f and the absence of such staining	in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover indicate that an antigen	of wtv was being stained	7179.147686243485
8459. f was first conjugated	with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin	787.168061145921
8460. this conjugate	was passed twice through dowex-2-chloride and treated with various	tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method	3476.3978443625974
8461. in all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still	present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence	1854.3353970462322
8462. in later experiments f and f were prepared by conjugating	8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin	2331.9841771607585
8463. these conjugates	f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate	while the specific staining	was similar in both cases	2015.965596739353
8464. nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily	eliminated by passing these conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column as described for f	2359.522829517281
8465. the best staining procedure with	this purified f consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30	minutes and washing in pbs for 15 minutes	2450.6132285276717
8466. the specificity of	staining with f was established as follows: f specifically stained	tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or	of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover	5139.324823764028
8467. sections of tumors incited	by wtv were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum	or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus	2033.2786523451784
8468. after	passing f through deae-cellulose the titer of antibodies to	wtv in the specific fraction was 1:4 of the titer before such	passage; but mere dilution	of the conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific	staining	5881.643999572229
8469. this indicates that increase in specificity of f after	passing it through deae-cellulose was not merely due to dilution	1714.8507302479163
8470. specific staining by deae-cellulose treated f	and f although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either	nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells was not satisfactorily	photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts	with black and white and color photography	6554.535113106345
8471. this was chiefly because	of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells	645.210162337215
8472. the autofluorescence	from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant	960.6322192152596
8473. results of specific staining by the	direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization	of wtv antigen in certain tissues of tumors	2587.5380908273733
8474. the virus antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue	391.1874239731153
8475. frequently a few isolated	thick-walled cells or rarely groups of such cells in the xylem region	were also specifically stained but there was no such staining	in epidermis cortex most xylem cells ray cells or pith	3855.461650119195
8476. within	the pseudophloem cells the distribution of wtv antigen was	irregular in the cytoplasm	1411.210236778664
8477. no antigen was detectable in certain dark	spherical areas in most cells	642.8617370118545
8478. these areas are thought to represent	the	nuclei	248.83756537067015
8479. in some tumor sections small spherical bodies possibly inclusion	bodies stained more intensely than	the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen	2337.13567884543
8480. in all cases	studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not	contain detectable amounts of wtv antigen	3244.5417842407246
8481. in	both the direct and indirect methods of staining the conjugates had	nonspecifically staining fractions	1094.067600372284
8482. in the indirect method this was	evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green	even when stained with ns and f or with f only	4480.257345475658
8483. in the direct	method f not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy	sweet clover stems nonspecifically and wtv tumor sections were similarly	stained by comparable f	2849.951249796549
8484. after f and f were passed through	dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover	tissue powder nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing	amount of such staining was still present	5269.166318588939
8485. treatment of the conjugates	with ethyl acetate and the conjugates	with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown	gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily	remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates	3730.1963450751537
8486. such	treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating	nonspecific staining in several other systems	2105.1126123379345
8487. schramm	and ro^ttger did not report any such nonspecific staining	of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco	mosaic virus	2007.2678324373937
8488. the reason for the failure of these treatments to	eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not	known	3031.970500713741
8489. in our work the best procedure for removing substances	causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was	to pass the conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column and in some cases to absorb the first and second	milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder	4514.242357003187
8490. the	specific	staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that wtv antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled	cells in the xylem region but was not detectable in any other	tissues of the root and stem tumors	6662.708223926998
8491. a study of the distribution of wtv	antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly	distributed in the cytoplasm	2030.7240301576317
8492. wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper	transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation		653.246049909894
8493. the concentration	and	apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue	of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies	in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order	to infect plants	4191.96018550356
8494. since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on	individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex	symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from	the cortex	5320.831347883802
8495. in experiments with topical application of strychnine on	the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the	hypothalamus was demonstrated	2329.097150512364
8496. moreover the responsiveness of the	hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these	conditions	1659.1387905515046
8497. even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms	of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey a on seeing	monkey b in emotional stress	2457.5539389307082
8498. a previously	extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey a	and was associated	with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic	discharges	3248.8661931938814
8499. it seems to follow that by and large an antagonism	exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity	is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines	the emotional responsiveness of the organism	4149.483070862389
8500. in addition the	neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates as	mirsky's interesting experiment on the communication of affect	demonstrates	3061.197466648533
8501. but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals	such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus	and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex	2879.2278734532597
8502. maclean stressed	correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of	the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the	limbic brain on emotions related to fight	and flight and also on sexual functions	6055.002115124955
8503. it should be added that in	man	neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion	of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory	imagination and creativity	2845.076747187119
8504. previous experiences are obviously	of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional	response	1408.3390910977141
8505. the visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute	to memory but this topic is beyond the scope of this	paper	2461.019953828345
8506. after	this brief discussion of neo- paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic	relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance	and its physiological and pathological significance	4296.902281916405
8507. facilitatory	processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending	and descending pathways	793.9215005806425
8508. thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical	application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate	with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive	discharges	4469.700336454494
8509. on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic	excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior	hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of	cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored	3957.2592034542663
8510. apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus	and the cerebral cortex	1188.7607928767152
8511. consequently if for any reason	the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level the	lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state	of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal	discharges	3667.8967201914907
8512. obviously a vicious cycle develops	22.100699325696233
8513. this tendency can	be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or	via cortico-hypothalamic pathways	1102.7185213028802
8514. it is believed that drug therapy	and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism	1889.8156855519615
8515. before we comment further on these pathological conditions	we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within	physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness	2751.9381145843713
8516. thus	a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep	and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous eeg	potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition	4832.877075314036
8517. moreover	the dominance in parasympathetic action	at the hypothalamic level induces by its peripheral	action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the	cortex a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus	of the somatic nervous system	4472.8335764592075
8518. with the dominance of the sympathetic	division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur	1405.921055237954
8519. since	electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects	of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces	sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is	altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus	4440.806166773962
8520. similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes	in man and animals	1422.9193862973311
8521. of particular importance is the study of	the actions of drugs in this respect	941.0722531418772
8522. although no drugs act exclusively	on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity	to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic	side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance	5800.05984057234
8523. the	former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers	503.2874922688813
8524. specific differences exist in the action of different drugs	belonging to the same group as for instance between reserpine and	chlorpromazine	3046.685045028693
8525. important as these differences are they should not	obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently	to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas	a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually	maniclike changes	4229.144874882257
8526. the emotional states produced by drugs influence	the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner; synchrony	prevails in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration	of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and	psychoactive drugs	5771.240043235169
8527. the shock therapies act likewise on the	hypothalamic balance	264.1768950967268
8528. physiological experiments and clinical observations	have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled	hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges	2825.839147590324
8529. they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side	261.90407449762574
8530. this explains	the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions	and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the	sympathetic system as shown by the mecholyl test	5185.697732320648
8531. some investigators	have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic	reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated	by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and	increasing deviation of this test from the norm	4313.858520474835
8532. nevertheless the	theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has	a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients	has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients	5324.486310598472
8533. the	mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are	reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake	of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect	of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions	additional tests seem to be desirable	4670.659285451109
8534. it was assumed that the	shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in	neuropsychiatric	patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures	follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle	4852.52575449494
8535. a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal	individual to sleep or in special circumstances to cardiovascular	collapse or nausea and vomiting	2874.332941886783
8536. in both conditions the emotional and	perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such	as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs	4486.893158459496
8537. the	fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states	of parasympathetic dominance remain to be	elucidated	1088.8813474943865
8538. perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies	in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges	which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative	alterations in reactivity	5624.074457340243
8539. a state of parasympathetic tuning	of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase	in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and	reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal:	a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in	this state of tuning a parasympathetic response! furthermore conditioned	reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic	reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level and several types	of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic	tuning are observed	0.20124717349522497
8540. if for instance such a change is	produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks previously	inhibited conditioned reactions reappear	3277.820114487912
8541. however if these procedures	are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily	abolished	946.7146884656297
8542. in other studies loss of differentiation in previously	established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive	treatments suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance	between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes	4652.055322905689
8543. it has	further been shown that: an experimental neurosis in its initial	stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic	balance; drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned	reactions; in a state of depression the positive conditioned	stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased	synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing	effect on the eeg	5623.639985122836
8544. these are few and seemingly disjointed data	but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations	in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic	balance has been altered by physiological experimentation	pharmacological action or clinical processes	6451.26227989868
8545. basis of some form of psychotherapy	the foregoing remarks	imply	that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads	between physiological and pathological forms of emotion	2995.112060920179
8546. if this is	the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just	mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional	state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise	5507.452567995043
8547. we	pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders	and neurotic symptoms particularly in certain types of personality	but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion	may cure a battle neurosis	3937.7036256344063
8548. this phenomenon raises the question	whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not	have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses	4267.420809219189
8549. being	a strictly	physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional	information on the nature of the emotional process itself	2187.1650497876904
8550. wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area	391.18375028851545
8551. he showed	convincingly that anxiety is a learned reaction and	is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed therefore	that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional	and reversible	3554.864979435494
8552. an important observation of pavlov served as a	guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means	2370.2056067733147
8553. in	a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding	and pain	643.2810516289054
8554. a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus	and was followed by feeding	1420.284695179578
8555. the pain became thus the symbol for food	and elicited salivary secretion	644.090258255942
8556. even when the	intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke	any signs of pain	2338.8805669876974
8557. since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental	neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental	situation wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism	to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding	3753.777256176937
8558. appropriate	experiments showed that this is indeed possible	249.68843582266078
8559. he then applied	this	principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses	493.82655254507983
8560. he took advantage	of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety	and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former	attitude was established	3884.850810741972
8561. for the interpretation of these significant	investigations it should be remembered that reciprocal relations	exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions	which are closely associated with the emotions	3445.5571337164633
8562. the feeding-pain	antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the	tropho- and ergotropic systems	2101.230742701527
8563. furthermore a functional antagonism	exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety	947.6842216083608
8564. although	in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic-somatic	patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively	as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state	of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test	5919.977833570018
8565. the psychological incompatibility	of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based	on this marked difference	1561.516992353714
8566. in	our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological	range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity	of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system	and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively	6558.438813922415
8567. we stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with	respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding	the hypothalamic-cortical discharge	2173.165363756238
8568. although we are still far from	a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation	it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent	changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for	major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions	in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and	clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents	8611.471128626119
8569. in view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in	the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism	observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several	instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may	play an important role in initiating mental changes	4824.0165589078615
8570. we are trying to study a	linear operator t on the finite-dimensional space v	by decomposing t into a direct sum of operators which are in some	sense elementary	4654.810636264341
8571. we can do this through the characteristic values	and vectors of t in certain special cases ie when the	minimal polynomial for t factors over the scalar field f	into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1	4135.804987782823
8572. what can	we do with the general t	252.49368130134954
8573. if we try to study t using	characteristic values we are confronted with two problems	1094.9553190620734
8574. first	t may not have a single characteristic value; this is really	a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically	closed	3892.2097451322456
8575. second even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely	over f into a product of polynomials of degree 1 there	may not be enough characteristic vectors for t to span the	space v; this is clearly a deficiency in t	4130.46777111669
8576. the second	situation is illustrated by the operator t on f	represented in the standard basis by f	2349.959882391103
8577. the characteristic	polynomial for a is f and this is plainly also the minimal	polynomial for a	1423.8000654156883
8578. thus t is not	diagonalizable	22.179888015066048
8579. one sees that this happens because the null space of	f has dimension 1 only	1101.8725561739664
8580. on the other hand the null space of f and	the null space of f together span v the former being the	subspace spanned by f and the latter the subspace spanned by f and	f	5769.105912232621
8581. this will be more or less our general method for the second	problem	793.5077826287501
8582. if the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes f where f are distinct elements of f	then we shall show that the space v is the direct sum	of the null spaces of f	5303.967058008461
8583. the diagonalizable operator is the special	case of this in which f for each i	1091.1746764373347
8584. the theorem which we prove	is more general than what we have described since it works with the	primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes	which enter are all of first degree	5781.873043563868
8585. the reader will find it helpful	to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 and	even more particularly to think of the proof of theorem 10 a special	case of this theorem	3939.6778091895662
8586. let t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional	vector space v over the field f	1900.153774151151
8587. let p be the	minimal polynomial for t f where the f are distinct irreducible	monic polynomials over f and the f are positive integers	2611.1976854889454
8588. let f be the null space of f	250.21265810420823
8589. then each f	is invariant under t if f is the operator induced on	f by t	then the minimal polynomial for f is f	2601.3586237943364
8590. the idea of the proof is this	141.819379412694
8591. if the direct-sum decomposition	is valid how can we get hold of the projections f associated with	the decomposition	1726.645851539001
8592. the projection f will be the identity on f	and zero on the other f	1650.0671560270162
8593. we shall find a polynomial f such that	f is the identity on f and is zero on the other f and so that	f etc	2733.354982157237
8594. for each i let f	22.155550365244654
8595. since f are distinct	prime polynomials the polynomials f are relatively prime		346.89805377310324
8596. thus there are polynomials f such that f	247.62682436886735
8597. note	also that if f then f is divisible by the polynomial p	because f contains each f as a factor	2032.6331422499193
8598. we shall show that the polynomials	f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of	the proof	2595.483057174543
8599. since f and p divides f for f	we have f	498.9217835215944
8600. thus the f are projections which correspond to some	direct-sum decomposition of the space v	1639.8536825030217
8601. we wish to show that	the range of f is exactly the subspace f	939.56566149627
8602. it is clear that each	vector in the range of f is in f for if |a is in the range of	f then f and so f because f is divisible by the minimal polynomial	p	5900.382216501116
8603. conversely suppose that |a is in the null space	of f	503.5177819140514
8604. if f then f is divisible by f and so f ie	f	1182.9261720805275
8605. but then it is immediate that f ie that |a is in	the range of f	1249.357013570543
8606. this completes the proof of statement	64.95861934590383
8607. it is certainly clear that the subspaces f are invariant under t	642.2163654844461
8608. if f is the operator induced on f by t then evidently	f because by definition f is 0 on the subspace f	3468.7127912141805
8609. this shows	that the minimal polynomial for f divides f	374.29732539592277
8610. conversely let	g be any polynomial such that f	387.16280459975644
8611. thus f is divisible	by the minimal polynomial p of t ie f	divides f	1097.2540340904823
8612. it is easily seen that f divides g	250.99821072152622
8613. hence the	minimal polynomial for f is f	166.41666544428318
8614. if f are the	projections associated with the primary decomposition of t then	each f is a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear	operator u commutes with t then u commutes with	each of the f ie each subspace f is invariant under u	7014.388924244236
8615. in the notation of the proof of theorem 12 let us take a	look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t	is a product of first-degree polynomials ie the case in	which	each f is of the form f	4458.040124277303
8616. now the range of f is the null space	f of f	957.9950681475432
8617. by theorem 10 d is a diagonalizable	operator which we shall call the	of t	1096.6408482983345
8618. let us look at the operator f	140.15294874801515
8619. now f f so f	14.832050538337544
8620. the reader	should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that	f and in general that f	3029.011049466328
8621. when f for each i we shall have	f because the operator f will then be 0 on the range of f	2168.106935460725
8622. let n be a linear operator on the vector	space v	756.1721429081915
8623. we say that n is if there	is some positive integer r such that f	1100.057942646946
8624. let	t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector	space v over the field f	1900.153774151151
8625. suppose that the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes over f into a product of linear	polynomials	1259.9446905904829
8626. then there is a diagonalizable operator d on	v and a nilpotent operator n on v such that	f f	2811.1706335093704
8627. the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent	operator n are uniquely determined by	and	each of them is a polynomial in t	2172.822771096174
8628. we have just observed	that we can write f where d is diagonalizable and n	is nilpotent and where d and n not only commute	but are polynomials in t	4836.056899958992
8629. now suppose that we also have f	where d' is diagonalizable n' is nilpotent and	f	1259.7481355249918
8630. we shall prove that f	22.049242855459266
8631. since d' and n'	commute with one another and f we see that d' and n'	commute with t	1720.731138082463
8632. thus d' and n'	commute with any polynomial in t; hence they commute with d	and with n	2337.5646443844357
8633. now we have f or f and all four of these	operators commute with one another	1254.0934035433233
8634. since d and d'	are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously	diagonalizable and f is diagonalizable	2362.0005643999516
8635. since n and n'	are both nilpotent and they commute the operator f is nilpotent;	for using the fact that n and n' commute f	and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression	for f will be 0	4376.715268199337
8636. space must have its nth power 0; if we take f	above that will be large enough	2096.7549004321154
8637. it then follows that f is large	now f is	a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent	1415.8750627890981
8638. such an operator	is obviously the zero operator; for since it is nilpotent the minimal	polynomial for this operator is of the form f for some f; but	then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial cannot	have a repeated root; hence f and the minimal polynomial is simply	x which says the operator is 0	8059.263825069347
8639. thus we see that f and	f	93.29062269485402
8640. let v be a finite-dimensional vector	space over an algebraically closed field f eg the field	of complex numbers	2599.992626363781
8641. then every linear operator t on v	can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and	a nilpotent operator n which commute	2598.482867610014
8642. these operators d	and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t	1409.2126705541552
8643. from these results one sees that the study of linear operators	on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced	to the study of nilpotent operators	2991.502814229698
8644. for vector spaces over non-algebraically	closed fields we still need to find some substitute for	characteristic values and vectors	2575.247341198584
8645. it is a very interesting fact that	these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we	shall do in the next chapter	2601.1864925005098
8646. in concluding this section we	should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of	the primary decomposition theorem	3279.015051081652
8647. we have chosen to give it at the	end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus	is not purely linear algebra	2596.3691551840084
8648. in the primary decomposition	theorem it is not necessary that the vector space v	be finite dimensional nor is it necessary for parts that	p be the	minimal polynomial for t	4985.036075295173
8649. if t is a linear operator	on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial	p such that f then parts of theorem 12 are valid	for t with the proof which we gave	3947.1911408989663
8650. let n be	a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times	continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which	satisfy the differential equation f where f are some fixed constants	5781.319298208277
8651. if f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable	functions then the space v of solutions of this differential	equation is a subspace of f	2719.991964864981
8652. if d denotes the differentiation	operator and p is the polynomial f then v	is the null space of the operator p because f simply says	f	4279.380708734125
8653. let us now regard d as a linear operator on the subspace	v	795.5456132302398
8654. if we are discussing differentiable complex-valued	functions then f and v are complex vector spaces	and f may be any complex numbers	3239.1723140943313
8655. we now write f where f are	distinct complex numbers	372.30072174355166
8656. if f is the null space of f then theorem	12 says that f	1405.9642691515987
8657. in other words if f satisfies the differential	equation f then f is uniquely expressible in the	form f where f satisfies the differential equation f	2733.384062001208
8658. thus the	study of the solutions to the equation f is reduced to the study of	the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form f	4475.572809409033
8659. this	reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra	ie	by the primary decomposition theorem	1580.0950310934752
8660. to describe	the space of solutions to f one must know something about differential	equations that is one must know something about d other	than the fact that it is a linear operator	5335.9734803706015
8661. however one does not	need to know very much	260.8782882717238
8662. it is very easy to establish by induction on	r that if f is in f then f that is f etc	3257.297541839705
8663. thus	f if and only if f	94.48346359796889
8664. a function g such that f ie	f must be a polynomial function of degree f or less: f	2572.7432150649097
8665. thus f satisfies f if and only if f has the form f	795.7134611775539
8666. accordingly the 'functions' f span the space of solutions of	f	749.0308094745585
8667. since f are linearly independent functions and the exponential	function has no zeros these r functions f form a basis for	the space of solutions	2620.387185823243
8668. some experiments are composed	of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible	outcomes	1399.9652326627524
8669. the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation	that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment	to another	2167.7109271937034
8670. we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not	only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real	life phenomena but also because it has important properties that recur	in many other probability models	6060.643133639405
8671. we begin with a few examples of	binomial experiments	261.4230565657083
8672. a trained marksman	shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions	may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times	3682.193935102794
8673. in repeated sets of	five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary	500.8830623133751
8674. what can we say of the	probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes	1406.8388101699488
8675. in litters of eight mice from similar parents	the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer	from 0 to 8	2607.104060302783
8676. what probabilities should be attached to these possible	outcomes	392.39895947488765
8677. when three dice are	tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of aces is	0	1410.6754402704755
8678. more generally	suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials	that each trial results in either a success or a non-success	and that the probability of success remains constant	from trial to trial	5758.645378986232
8679. in the examples above the occurrence of	a bull's-eye	a straight-haired mouse or an ace could be called a success	1890.7898743873266
8680. in general any outcome we choose may be labeled success	561.5181643625311
8681. the major question in this chapter is: what is the probability	of exactly x successes in n trials	1559.2682800945313
8682. in	chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples	usually by counting points in a sample space	3049.5255539729183
8683. fortunately a general	formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind	780.6147232402277
8684. before	deriving this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this	kind	1398.4581574741246
8685. experiments are often composed of several identical	trials and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated	940.8801443743399
8686. in the marksmanship	example a trial consists of one round shot at a target	with outcome either one bull's-eye	2600.402429856182
8687. further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets	of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several	repetitions of the five-round experiment	2978.1786451948583
8688. if three dice are tossed	a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of	three trials	3059.5225715303986
8689. or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed	three times each toss is a trial and the three tosses form the experiment	2745.1026224019834
8690. mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of	three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times	2810.228111672397
8691. these	examples are illustrative of the use of the words trial and experiment	as they are used in this chapter but they are quite flexible	example	ten students act as managers for	a high-school football team and of these managers a proportion p	are licensed drivers	4669.341580159531
8692. each friday one manager is chosen by lot to	stay late and load the equipment on a truck	2361.008179383344
8693. on three fridays the coach	has needed a driver	265.4485190123711
8694. considering only these fridays what is the	probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times	1876.5936624032784
8695. exactly 2 times	0.20041515
8696. 1 time	0.30041514999999996
8697. 0 time	0.20041515
8698. note that there are 3 trials	of interest	249.97721560396863
8699. each trial consists of choosing a student manager at	random	374.75016483918324
8700. the 2 possible outcomes on each trial are driver or nondriver	756.3350418750816
8701. since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of	different trials are independent	1094.4285658906097
8702. the managers stay the same so that	f is the same for all weeks	1406.3906093224546
8703. we now generalize these ideas for general	binomial experiments	264.01950253703427
8704. for an experiment to qualify as a	binomial experiment it must have four properties: there must	be a fixed number of trials each trial must result in a success	or a failure all trials must have	identical probabilities of success the trials must be independent	of each other	7203.936949716923
8705. below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate	these four properties	796.1335946378434
8706. we also give for each property an example	where the property is absent	1188.2686603725401
8707. the language and notation introduced	1	43.50835875078212
8708. there must be a fixed	number n of repeated trials	557.7502326133728
8709. we study sets	of five shots; for the mice we restrict attention to litters	experiment	toss a die until an ace appears	2173.418197792271
8710. here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number	1186.6022511152482
8711. each of the n trials is either a success	or a failure	644.9800040797679
8712. success and failure are just convenient	labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial	trials in general	3053.345986086033
8713. these words are more expressive than labels like	a and not-a	509.99882903319815
8714. it is natural from the marksman's	viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success but in the mice example	it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse	4832.947233579451
8715. the word binomial means of two names or of two terms	and both usages apply in our work: the first to the names of the	two outcomes of a binomial trial and the second to the terms p	and f that represent the probabilities of success and failure	4825.866754053931
8716. sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial	we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die	where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes ace and not-ace	5518.930400929727
8717. we classify	mice as straight-haired or wavy-haired but a hairless	mouse appears	647.2463056834696
8718. we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the	animal as not constituting a trial but such a solution is not always	satisfactory	3914.747797676573
8719. each die has probability f of producing an ace; the marksman	has some probability p perhaps 0	1412.218254930541
8720. 1 of making a bull's-eye	22.37941974128948
8721. note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment	to be binomial	1252.5596637788863
8722. during	a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles	4	1894.7719296745884
8723. this means that the probability	for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by	multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the	single binomial trials	3095.197084426459
8724. thus in the three-dice example f f and	the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three	dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order is	4298.258447517548
8725. experimentally	we expect independence when the trials have nothing to	do with one another	944.0503565277007
8726. a family	of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains	and a coin is tossed to decide	3499.681467061206
8727. we want to know the number of people	going to the mountains	639.7471019930292
8728. when this experiment is viewed as composed	of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes	of the trials are obviously not independent	4284.909964615601
8729. indeed the experiment	is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire	family	1261.5741925083244
8730. the following is a less extreme example of dependence	389.61868641427975
8731. consider	couples visiting an art museum	43.4323054465399
8732. each person votes for one of a pair	of pictures to receive a popular prize	1648.0414654614858
8733. voting for one picture may	be called success for the other failure	637.9328692110959
8734. an experiment	consists of the voting of one couple or two trials	961.9695555898841
8735. in repetitions	of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons	in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because	couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar	tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population	of visitors	5200.887658389648
8736. table 7-1 illustrates the point	22.237697758881176
8737. the table shows	that 0	14.81710100571953
8738. 6 of the boys and 0	65.78715730296364
8739. 6 of the girls vote for picture a	167.39833341371644
8740. therefore under independent voting f or 0	141.56119232087192
8741. 36 of the couples would	cast two votes for picture a and f or 0	1107.8378680088324
8742. 16 would cast	two votes for picture b	250.92257059426555
8743. thus in independent voting f or 0	94.43933700802503
8744. 52	of the couples would agree	66.05667107307495
8745. but table 7-1 shows that f or 0	167.81508497252156
8746. 70 agree	too many for independent voting	140.9003130852944
8747. each performance of an n-trial	binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0	through n as the value of the random variable x where	f	2735.3179217626775
8748. we want to study the probability function of this random variable	750.0169497098681
8749. for example we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes	not which shots were bull's-eyes	1092.1000534556947
8750. a binomial experiment can produce	random variables other than the number of successes	1182.801008624927
8751. for example the	marksman gets 5 shots but we take his score to be the number of shots	before his first bull's-eye that is 0 1 2 3 4		2240.5057742660656
8752. thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes	and the random variable is not the number of successes	2582.2165793027693
8753. the constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most	likely to give trouble in practice	1421.8526826462494
8754. obviously very slight changes	in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of	independence may not make an appreciable difference	3693.9235055664285
8755. on the	other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical	phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used	as a baseline for comparative purposes; that is we may discuss the	to	a binomial experiment consists of f independent	binomial trials all with the same probability f of yielding a success	5358.741711193431
8756. the outcome of the experiment is x successes	250.488488437889
8757. the random	variable x takes the values f with probabilities f or more	briefly f	1100.7906915269978
8758. we shall find a formula for the probability of	exactly x successes for given values of p and n	2567.3281390190305
8759. when	each number of successes x is paired with its probability of	occurrence f the set of pairs f is a probability function called	a binomial distribution	2842.1383735869185
8760. the choice of p and n determines	the binomial distribution uniquely and different choices always	produce different distributions		1470.7350603623738
8761. the set of all binomial distributions is	called the family of binomial distributions but in general discussions	this expression is often shortened to the binomial distribution	or even the binomial when the context is clear	3776.3579838252094
8762. binomial distributions	were treated by james bernoulli about 1700 and for this	random	each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces	either 0 or 1 success	4111.3987173718
8763. therefore each binomial trial can be thought	of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that	trial and taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities q and	p respectively	3570.2356983668265
8764. the several trials of a binomial experiment	produce a new random variable x the total number of successes	which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single	trials	5170.239791799755
8765. the marksman gets two bull's-eyes one	on his third shot and one on his fifth	1111.847384567128
8766. the numbers of successes on	the five individual shots are then 0 0 1 0 1	1895.804454720929
8767. the number of successes	on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0	or 1 and there are 5 such random variables here	2996.5570607227955
8768. their sum is x	the total number of successes which in this experiment has the	value f	2108.372254767709
8769. consider a simple closed plane curve c which is a real-analytic	image of the unit circle and which is given by f	2186.048431317796
8770. these	are real analytic periodic functions with period t	388.80251812136123
8771. in the	following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly	an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does	not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares	3862.8185044341103
8772. this theorem	is similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exists a circumscribing	cube around any closed bounded convex set in f	3462.2568775132627
8773. the latter theorem	has been generalized by yamabe and yujobo and cairns to show	that in f there are families of such cubes	2320.5318025289153
8774. here for the case of	squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity	and give certain other results	3040.86614938733
8775. a square inscribed in a curve	c means a square with its four corner points on the curve	though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c	3107.0275877316353
8776. indeed	the spiral f with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses	only one inscribed square	2371.6354582641866
8777. the square has one corner point on	the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior	1731.9773703038031
8778. on c from the point p at f to the point q	at f we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side	erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square	is inside c	6576.177310137755
8779. as s increases we consider the two free	corner points of the square f and f adjacent to p and q	respectively	2192.7871269659954
8780. as s approaches t the square will	be outside c and therefore both f and f must cross c	an odd number of times as s varies from zero to t	4991.12568483796
8781. the points may also touch c without crossing	167.7648166542468
8782. suppose	f crosses c when f	65.10366582986751
8783. we now have certain squares with three	corners on c	376.8864069924975
8784. for any such square the middle corner of these	will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the	curve will be called the diagonal point of the square	5343.116047114107
8785. each point on	c as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal	points by the above construction	1883.4603810945114
8786. to each paired vertex	and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point	ie the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c	from the vertex in the direction of increasing t	5491.370714218772
8787. if the	vertex is at f and if the interior of c is on the left as	one moves in the direction of increasing t then every such corner	can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c clockwise	through 90` about the vertex	4642.091582552599
8788. the set of intersections of f	the rotated curve with the original curve c consists of just	the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex	at f plus the vertex itself	5644.031432264351
8789. we note that two such curves c	and f cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points;	otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which	is impossible since they do not coincide near f	4035.0638990353264
8790. with each	vertex we associate certain numerical values namely the set of positive	differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding	forward corner points	4278.943183022244
8791. for the vertex at f these values	will be denoted by f	637.1788962171061
8792. the function f defined in this way	is multi-valued	391.8103938142558
8793. we consider now the graph of the function	f on f	500.9344592380965
8794. we will refer to the plane of c and f as	the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane	3486.019845965044
8795. the graph as a set may have a finite number of components	638.442761914928
8796. we	will denote the values of f on different components by f	952.1873625793926
8797. each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection	between c and f	1100.5143451651143
8798. there are two types of such intersections	depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point	of intersection	2583.776964218498
8799. an ordinary point will be any point of intersection	a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane	f meets both the interior and the exterior of c	3225.866342300477
8800. any other point of intersection between c and f will be called	a tangent point	1644.0107265251322
8801. this terminology will also be applied to the	corresponding points in the f-plane	788.8610883240071
8802. we can now prove several	lemmas	65.34851930472779
8803. in some neighborhood in the f-plane of	any ordinary point of the graph the function f is a single-valued	continuous function	2028.4890770062786
8804. we first show that the function	is	single-valued in some neighborhood	753.8391947333549
8805. with the vertex at f in the c-plane	we assume that f is the parametric location on c	of an ordinary intersection q between c and f	2858.9128183704597
8806. in	the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are	f	748.4661279677816
8807. we know that in the c-plane both c and f are analytic	643.3406798344912
8808. in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian	coordinates u v with the origin at q and	such that both c and f have finite slope at q	4824.435632713927
8809. near	q both curves can be represented by analytic functions of	u	638.1113266351904
8810. in a neighborhood of q the difference between these	functions is also a single-valued analytic function of u	2361.689111690669
8811. furthermore	one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference	function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only	a finite number of extrema in any interval	3445.1853752682982
8812. now to find f one needs	the intersection of c and f near q	1412.825437185587
8813. but f is just	the curve f translated without rotation through a small arc for	f is always obtained by rotating c through exactly 90`	2603.023119007346
8814. the	arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve	562.3483509220806
8815. thus if e is	sufficiently	small there can be only one intersection of c and	f near q for if there were more than one intersection for every	e then the difference between c and f near q	would not be a monotone function	4551.536838228821
8816. therefore f is single-valued	near q	65.19153540448814
8817. it is also seen that f since the change from f	to f is accomplished by a continuous translation	1724.7884959977177
8818. thus f is also	continuous at f and in a neighborhood of f which does not contain	a tangent point	2815.182839982649
8819. we turn now to the set of tangent points on	the graph	641.5426108985511
8820. this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals	561.6976606289436
8821. the fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except	in closed intervals follows from the argument used in lemma 1 namely	that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curves c	and f are analytic and therefore the difference between them	must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the	tangent point	5615.460063304839
8822. this prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence	of isolated tangent points	964.6627578483397
8823. in some neighborhood of	an	isolated tangent point in the f-plane say f the function f is	either double-valued or has no values defined except at the tangent	point itself where it is single-valued	3667.061425937918
8824. a tangent point	q in the c-plane occurs when c and f are	tangent to one another	2123.9839422648247
8825. a continuous change in t through an amount	e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve	f	2029.629963062173
8826. there are three possibilities: f remains tangent to	c as it is translated; f moves away from c and	does not intersect it at all for f; f cuts across c	and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in f	6565.536201199537
8827. the	first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points	in the f-plane the end points of which fall into category	or	2333.7251571999814
8828. in the second category the function f has no values defined	in a neighborhood f	1647.505711332616
8829. in the third category the function is double-valued	in this interval	505.44577416026766
8830. the same remarks apply to an interval on the	other side of f	1185.6551009854834
8831. again the analyticity of the two curves guarantee	that such intervals exist	639.8597880518605
8832. in the neighborhood of an end point of an	interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued	or no-valued on one side and is a single-valued function consisting	entirely of tangent points on the other side	6214.535492270886
8833. with the	above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f	1100.4001905454106
8834. first for any value of t for which all values of f	are ordinary points the number of values of f must be	odd	3643.4128351492245
8835. for it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections	of c and f must be even	and the	center of rotation at t is the argument of the function not a	value	3653.517944264359
8836. therefore for any value of t the number of values of	f is equal to the number of tangent points corresponding	to the argument t plus an odd number	4619.440148606896
8837. the	number of ordinary values of the function f at t	will be called its multiplicity at t	1560.5242587874654
8838. the graph	of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval	0t	1898.6032513106934
8839. then every component	of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval	1099.1280626682042
8840. suppose f is defined in the sub-interval f	250.81108908960292
8841. now f and f	must both be tangent points on the nth component in the f-plane;	otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond	these points	2877.452512583505
8842. further we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of	f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can	only change by an even integer	4848.718887067997
8843. thus the multiplicity of f for a given	t must be an even number	940.9867251376281
8844. this is true of all components	which have such a bounded support	961.6596580450447
8845. but this is a contradiction for we	know that the multiplicity of f is odd for every t	1570.5244850902511
8846. we have shown that the graph of f contains at least one	component whose inverse is the entire interval 0t and	whose multiplicity is odd	3904.861726159053
8847. there must be an odd number of such components	which will be called complete components	1090.144434552461
8848. the remaining	components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument	and are defined only on a proper	sub-interval of 0t	3697.108973994239
8849. we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist	two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the c-plane	are on opposite sides of c	3210.0159414211766
8850. we again consider a	fixed point p at f and a variable point q at f on	c	2363.82550040744
8851. we erect a square with pq as a side and with free	corners f and f adjacent to p and q respectively	2191.8466810662703
8852. as s varies from zero to t the values of s for	which f and f cross c will be denoted by f and f	respectively	4073.9310028105792
8853. we have f plus tangent points	43.76870034079038
8854. these s-values	are just the ordinary values of f	391.2966404749601
8855. the values f	are the ordinary values at f of a multi-valued function g	which has components corresponding to those of f	2172.9324167396526
8856. we first define a function b as follows: given the	set of squares such that each has three corners on c and vertex	at t b is the corresponding set of positive parametric	differences between t and the backward corner points	6480.0068060637095
8857. the functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity	at every argument t	945.693491568436
8858. now with p fixed at f f-values	occur when the corner f crosses c and are among the values	of s such that f	3672.554882903455
8859. the roots of this equation are just the	ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight	line of unit slope through f in the b-plane		2248.3664384878875
8860. we define these values as f and define g	in the same way for each t	1882.040275818353
8861. thus we obtain g	by introducing an oblique g-axis in the b-plane	642.6154818315538
8862. in 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions	in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex	numbers	3468.8393316741
8863. these are defined by a simple involutorial transformation	of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface	bearing a curve of symbol f	2874.8831988902593
8864. then in 2 we show that any line	involution with the properties that it has no complex of invariant	lines and its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve is necessarily of the	type discussed in 1	6901.4705308142275
8865. no generalization of these results to spaces	of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible	1571.9439030698725
8866. let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli f	and f and let \g be a f curve of order k on q	3700.3387828820887
8867. a	general line l meets q in two points f and f through	each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus f whose	lines are simple secants of \g	3336.9920716369697
8868. on these generators let f and	f be respectively the harmonic conjugates of f and f with respect	to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets \g	4650.846703879672
8869. the line f is the image of l	167.25398277511917
8870. clearly the transformation	is involutorial	22.39046638042536
8871. we observe first that no line l	can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q	1723.9429292545228
8872. for if it did the plane of l and l' would contain	two generators of f which is impossible	2587.342151869412
8873. moreover from the definitive	transformation of intercepts on the generators of f it is clear	that the only points of q at which a line can meets its image	are the points of \g	3658.3482293049456
8874. hence the totality of singular lines is	the kth order complex of lines which meet \g	1882.2275789069113
8875. the	invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of \g	since each of these meets q in two points which are invariant	2605.886846951661
8876. the order of this congruence is f since f secants of a curve of	symbol  on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point	3686.820754279055
8877. the class of the congruence is f since an arbitrary plane meets	\g in k points	1256.752245995231
8878. since the complex of singular	lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant	lines it follows from the formula f that the order of the involution	is f	5303.705384696294
8879. there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines	whose images are not unique	940.6330537314655
8880. the most obvious of these is the quadratic	complex of tangents to q each line of which is transformed	into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image	of the point of tangency of the given line	6289.658553312719
8881. thus pencils of	tangents to q are transformed into pencils of tangents	636.2742664401778
8882. it is	interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established between the	lines of two such pencils so that in a sense a unique image can actually	be assigned to each tangent	5160.761754921667
8883. for the lines of any plane |p	meeting q in a conic c are transformed into the congruence	of secants of the curve c' into which c is	transformed in the point involution on q	3754.3181880249986
8884. in particular tangents	to c are transformed into tangents to c'	752.5307965676943
8885. moreover	if f and f are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent	to q at a point p the two free intersections of	the image curves f and f must coincide at p' the image	of p and at this point f and f must have a common tangent	l'	5065.823701597844
8886. hence thought of as a line in a particular plane |p	any tangent to q has a unique image and moreover this image	is the same for all planes through l	4997.866141047865
8887. each generator	|l of f is also exceptional for each is transformed into the	entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator	is transformed by the point involution on q	3545.244028583356
8888. this curve is of	symbol f since it meets |l and hence every line of f in the	f invariant points on |l and since it obviously meets every line	of f in a single point	5761.140779848932
8889. the congruence of its secants is therefore	of order f and class f	787.2205658211112
8890. a final class of exceptional lines	is identifiable from the following considerations: since no two	generators of f can intersect it follows that their image curves	can have no free intersections	5003.7337684435115
8891. in other words these curves have only	fixed intersections common to them all	786.962802409577
8892. now the only way in which all	curves of the image family of f can pass through a fixed point is	to have a generator of f which is not a secant but a tangent of \g	for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into	the point of tangency	7668.016155229135
8893. since two curves of symbol f on q intersect	in f points it follows that there are f lines of f which	are tangent to \g	2718.210818376502
8894. clearly any line l of any bundle	having one of these points of tangency t as vertex will be transformed	into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection	of l and q as vertex and lying in the plane determined	by the image point and the generator of f which is tangent to	\g at t	8190.4933233829015
8895. a line through two of these points f and f	will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the	tangents to \g at f and f as directrices	3107.9148648240994
8896. a conic c	being a curve on q meets the image of any line	of f which we have already found to be a f curve on q	in f points	4982.208186549162
8897. hence its image c' meets any line of f	in f points	636.3799597260811
8898. moreover c' obviously meets any line f in	a single point	747.7837435280248
8899. hence c' is a f curve on q	167.62302146445077
8900. therefore	the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general	plane field of lines is of order f and class f	3679.0282506215212
8901. finally the image	of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order	of the congruence of invariant lines namely f and whose class is	the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines	namely f	4546.434247015195
8902. the preceding observations make it clear that there	exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex	of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve \g	6426.192107259415
8903. we now shall	show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily	of the type we have just described	1732.6651719109782
8904. to do this we must first	show that every line which meets \g in a point p meets its	image at p	3259.856845533215
8905. to see this consider a general pencil of lines	containing a general secant of \g	1102.8576172103667
8906. by the image of this pencil	is a ruled surface of order f which is met by the plane of the	pencil in a curve c of order f	4645.421114320276
8907. on c there is a	f correspondence in which the f points cut from c by a general	line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection	of the image of l and the plane of the pencil	4213.339047453365
8908. since c	is rational this correspondence has k coincidences each	of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image	3250.5645819405313
8909. however	since the pencil contains a secant of \g it actually contains only	f singular lines	1251.497502604036
8910. to avoid this contradiction it is necessary that	c be composite with the secant of \g and a curve of	order f as components	3694.2592596950503
8911. thus it follows that the secants of \g	are all invariant	503.54388805133095
8912. but if this is the case then an arbitrary pencil	of lines having a point p of \g as vertex is transformed	into a ruled surface of order f having f generators concurrent at	p	5638.130719186073
8913. since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent	generators	is necessarily a cone it follows finally that every line through	a point p of \g meets its image at p as asserted	3646.7067523940614
8914. now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle	with vertex p on \g which is effected by the involution	as a whole	3711.058525313287
8915. from the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle	is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion	1730.8561095810815
8916. moreover	in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order f namely	the cone of secants of \g which pass through p	3877.514660840048
8917. hence	it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective	de jonquieres involution of order f and the invariant locus must	have a multiple line of multiplicity either f or f	3649.7812893188757
8918. the first possibility	requires that there be a line through p which meets	\g in f points; the second requires that there be a line through	p which meets \g in f points	5308.090932682752
8919. in each case lines	of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they	determine with the multiple secant	1882.2617900084329
8920. in the first case the fixed elements	within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the	vertex p to the intersection of \g and the plane of	the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant	6339.496324670459
8921. in the second	the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex p to	the two intersections of \g and the plane of the pencil which do	not lie on the multiple secant	3668.195250819865
8922. the multiple secants of course are	exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order f	2345.19081686067
8923. observations similar to these can be made at each point of \g	644.0660896899085
8924. hence \g must have either a regulus of f-fold secants or	a regulus of f-fold secants	1893.016061506362
8925. moreover if f no two of the multiple	secants can intersect	505.7035481971733
8926. for if such were the case either the plane	of the two lines would meet \g in more than k points or	alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined	by the two lines would be too high	6463.188054285522
8927. but if no two lines of the regulus	of multiple secants of \g can intersect then the regulus must	be quadratic or in other words \g must be either a f or a f	curve on a nonsingular quadric surface	4244.675509973484
8928. we now observe that	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric is impossible if	the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which	meet \g	5171.652464626041
8929. for any pencil in a plane containing a f-fold secant	of \g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil	in f lines namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass	through the intersection of \g and the multiple secant plus an additional	component to account for the intersections of the images of	the general lines of the pencil	5746.4955999736685
8930. however if there is no additional complex	of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is	precisely f	3261.0942065928843
8931. this contradicts the preceding observations and so	under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that	\g is a f curve on a quadric surface	2996.2453926892695
8932. continuing with	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric q we first	observe that the second regulus of q consists precisely of	the lines which join the two free intersections of \g and the planes	through any one of the multiple secants	7130.331870440115
8933. for each of these lines	meets q in three points namely two points on \g and one	point on one of the multiple secants	2481.009380862967
8934. now consider an arbitrary	line l meeting q in two points f and f	1410.0930358742942
8935. if	|a is the multiple secant of \g which passes through f and	|b is the simple secant of \g which passes through f and	if f are the points in which |a meets \g and if f is the	image of f on the generator |b it follows that the image of	the line f is f	5429.637297103107
8936. these societies can expect to face difficult times	247.89956685292864
8937. as the historic	processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion	will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and	subjects town and country will widen; new aspirants for power will	emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may	lose their nerve and their sense of direction	5011.606605089996
8938. national leaders will	have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people	through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's	sense of identity	4269.0560237007385
8939. feelings of a community of interest will have to	be recreated- in some of the new nations indeed they must be built	for the first time- on a new basis which looks toward the future and	does not rely only on shared memories of the past	4680.722990012703
8940. nevertheless with	foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous	consequences of social change which have troubled other countries	passing through this stage can be escaped	4641.524603528202
8941. the united states can	help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries	face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms	of assistance where possible	3238.345836351479
8942. our central goal should be	to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle	boldly the tasks which they face	3272.049871133603
8943. at the same time we should recognize	that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability	which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone	to diversions and external adventures of all sorts	3832.9748626232745
8944. it may seem to some	of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing	in the	murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable	tasks at home	5442.273549248721
8945. we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion	both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting	firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene	3108.229898301309
8946. when necessary	we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal	advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for	disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but	also risk their own prospects for orderly development	7036.809735035762
8947. as a nation	we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development;	but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly	seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world	community	3850.7799783284586
8948. when we look at countries like	iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress has been	made	in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital	and where institutions of centralized government exist we find	a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence	different priorities for policy	7963.752116572448
8949. the men in power are committed	in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding	only erratically	1731.7140358376942
8950. isolated enterprises have been launched but	they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern	2342.136169422877
8951. the	society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban	sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications	between the two	2855.250340378144
8952. progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions	to effective action among those in power and by a failure on	their part to understand how local resources human and material can	be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically	accepted	6415.578970796725
8953. most countries in this second category share	the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political	and social system without the modern standards of performance required	to make them effective	3534.331075500623
8954. in these rapidly changing societies there	is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals	2573.1908201785154
8955. the colonial period has generally left people believing that government	can if it wishes provide all manner of services for them-	and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the	benefits of modern life	4129.766394583562
8956. for example in accordance with the fashion	of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development	plans of varying numbers of years; such is the mystique of	planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow	automatically upon its announcement	6650.773216333337
8957. the civil services in such societies	are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing	them; and their members often equate a government career with security	and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence	3870.7346130833844
8958. american policy should press constantly the view that	until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their	bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize	of democratize their societies	5315.883215967804
8959. we should spread the view that	planning and national development are serious matters which call for	effort as well as enthusiasm	2030.8560297941071
8960. above all we should seek to encourage	the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they	are responsible for their fates	3696.940090477652
8961. only within the framework of a mature	relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can	we provide telling assistance	1733.3262060274483
8962. with respect to those countries whose	leaders prefer to live with their illusions we can afford to wait	for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all	to see	5307.358215965843
8963. our technical assistance to these countries should	place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the	role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts	assumed in dealing with the central governments	3954.9295169399556
8964. we should encourage	the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities	state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller	groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is	neglected	5513.15091394358
8965. simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships	of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural	training can be introduced into education how health affects labor	productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community	and above all how progress in each field relates to national progress	4817.389174138412
8966. efforts such as the community development program in the philippines	have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward	balanced national development	3048.640163037054
8967. to achieve this goal of balanced development	communications between the central government and the local communities	must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves	are effectively taken into account	3546.8967895532005
8968. if modernization programs	are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of	the people they will encounter grave difficulties	2819.9080063205324
8969. land reform	is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries	937.8881433705335
8970. it should	be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform	programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic	growth and modernization of the society	4987.773302187686
8971. as an isolated policy	land reform is likely to be politically disruptive; as part of a larger	development effort however it may gain wide acceptance	2586.5139701404833
8972. it should	also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved	by administrative decrees alone	2349.7024934881165
8973. land reform programs need to be	supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance	in agriculture	1567.3627564923477
8974. lastly governmental and private planners	will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming	ahead	2117.346535128688
8975. by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the	united states can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted	economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth	2866.472210652584
8976. modernizing societies	at a third stage in the modernization	process are such countries as india brazil the philippines and	taiwan which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining	growth	5340.8875041247775
8977. they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs;	and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity	around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing	participation in the program to wider and wider groups	3848.1368830040433
8978. but these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary	human and social overhead capital; they have established reasonably	stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local	levels; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically	and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies	7519.315406314263
8979. on the economic front the first priority of these countries	is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources	1739.0076447561082
8980. several related	tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved	1405.4886067857929
8981. these countries must formulate a comprehensive long-term program	covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors	of the economy	2200.4687401387628
8982. they must in their planning be able to count on at least	tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods	of several years	3467.951504141267
8983. capital imports drawn from a number of sources must	be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment	programming to go forward	2313.676283102502
8984. capital flows must be coordinated with	national needs and planning	559.8143963609457
8985. finally a balance must be effected among	project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general	balance of payments support	1733.332573425611
8986. thus although the agenda of external	assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the	policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant	the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages	of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining	growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange	8236.061377601627
8987. there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved	374.5987589523527
8988. for one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained	bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects; even the	famed indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous	range of tasks it has undertaken	5906.077797696222
8989. technical assistance in training middle-	and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases	1094.6823279083094
8990. there are also more basic problems	65.60219038647365
8991. this is the stage at which democratic	developments must take place if the society is to become an	open community of creative people	2315.2767800572215
8992. nevertheless impulses still exist	among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need	for centralized and authoritarian practices	3040.3725502674124
8993. another great danger is	that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated	from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference	to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism	3859.7322682983554
8994. the capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional	classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to	be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their	own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts	in the west	6698.482050762929
8995. particularly when based upon a single dominant party	governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of	understanding about the national interest	2599.2728476564907
8996. convinced of the wisdom of	their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development	programs governments may fail to push outward to win more	and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and	inflexible in their policies	6679.9649377406095
8997. american policy toward such societies	should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional	classes	1262.4872262103206
8998. it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation	of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers	and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies	4107.144122220036
8999. we	have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic	and free countries; we also have in consequence the duty to appraise	realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate	our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways	4378.816525171441
9000. factor	we have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society	will take a considerable period of time	2347.0704582318785
9001. with the exception of	treaty-making foreign relations were historically concerned for the	most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration	2319.3214767860923
9002. foreign	policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled	not merely at response but also at projection	2812.9237040853395
9003. american and free-world	policies can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically	that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in	the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which	each society must generate	4019.7210918084793
9004. it follows that any effective policy toward	the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working	horizon	2111.8890819428116
9005. it must be marked by a patience and persistence which have	not always been its trademark	1252.2574566313924
9006. this condition affects not only	the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign	policy especially in the context of economic aid	3706.9678469481514
9007. the place of	religion in the simple preliterate societies is quite definite; as	a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly	in every part of it	3234.9110003408523
9008. in societies like ours however its place	is less clear and more complex	1177.3738814101755
9009. with the diversity of religious viewpoints	there are differences of opinion as to the essential features	of religion; and there are different opinions as to the essential	functions of religion	3224.1428635465372
9010. nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous	advanced societies though less for the less religious portion	religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions	4089.859117703575
9011. although the inner functions of religion are not of direct	significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences	1719.8016505742823
9012. if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual	is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate;	he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic; he is	better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows	6448.623151154048
9013. there are	several closely related inner functions	94.29584599744263
9014. in the last analysis	religion is the means of inducing formulating expressing enhancing	implementing and perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious	3064.881579726788
9015. man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow	93.7339335677777
9016. religion	seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence	388.67568903729625
9017. the significant	things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional	mental and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs	of self-preservation self-pacification and self-completion	3110.6986542936197
9018. the chief	experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions	of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power	3049.3263936204066
9019. related to	this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual	his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively	secure in an ordered dependable universe	3859.156423659987
9020. man has the experience	of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand;	he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and	movement	4658.825496633956
9021. the universe is a safe and permanent home	167.74932537168002
9022. a number	of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the	ultimate and eternal	2362.176605767264
9023. death is not permanent defeat and disappearance;	man has a second chance	637.4846790820097
9024. he is not lost in the abyss of endless	time; he has endless being	1410.434465870804
9025. religion at its best also offers the	experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm	of the spirit	2038.4843610578464
9026. religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve	all the highest ideals and values- ethical aesthetic and religious-	of man formed in his culture	3470.015768721035
9027. there is also the possibility	among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life	and enjoying guidance and expansiveness	1723.000045199993
9028. the kind of religious experience	that most moderns seek not only provides clarifies and relates	human yearnings values ideals and purposes; it also provides facilities	and incitements for the development of personality sociality	and creativeness	5614.951023574774
9029. under the religious impulse whether theistic or	humanistic men have joy in living; life leads somewhere	1257.395303717514
9030. religion	at its best is out in front ever beckoning and leading on and as lippman	put it mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant	sense of his own infinite importance	5180.059342736945
9031. at the same	time	that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and	gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has	great therapeutic value for him	3466.2788390939145
9032. it gives him aid comfort even solace	in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical	knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate	4306.03243743415
9033. he is confronted	with the recurrent crises such as great natural catastrophes and	the great transitions of life- marriage incurable disease widowhood	old age the certainty of death	3012.8252969133746
9034. he has to cope with frustration	and other emotional disturbance and anomie	966.3943257173335
9035. his religious beliefs provide	him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause	him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity	and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune	fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger	4147.580473022179
9036. religion	usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised	perfect future state	1648.6768350264579
9037. the belief in immortality where held	functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here	and now	1891.4596565924999
9038. the tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing	or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less	self-contained or self-sufficient by confession repentance and penance	4286.09616827042
9039. the feeling of individual inferiority defeat or humilation growing	out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures	is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly	but all-victorious father-god as well as by sympathetic fellowship	with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious	acts for giving vent to emotions and energies	5457.555654691232
9040. in providing	for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf	of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is	no other institution	4099.732617974788
9041. in addition to the functions of religion	within man there have always been the outer social functions for the	community and society	2181.5981356920606
9042. the two have never been separable	65.06764027436131
9043. religion	is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation	375.24406446111976
9044. the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with	and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious	beliefs and convictions	4479.546861976454
9045. the religion supports re-enforces	reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values	373.728456913999
9046. even in the united	states with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast	denominational differentiation there is a general consensus regarding	the basic christian values	4477.311652221685
9047. this is demonstrated especially when there	is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere;	for example americans rally to christian values vis-a-vis those	of atheistic communism	2727.27088644798
9048. in america also all of our major religious bodies	officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of	our common religion	3042.653797191443
9049. even the non-church members- the freewheelers	marginal religionists and so on- have the values of christian civilization	internalized in them	1881.379396585875
9050. furthermore religion tends to integrate	the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god	to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example those regarding	material objects and pragmatic ends	5310.7906408742
9051. finally it gives sanctity	more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference	transcendent and supernatural importance to some values; for example	marriage as a sacrament much law-breaking as sinful occasionally	the state as a divine instrument	3968.3671563724856
9052. it places certain values at least	beyond questioning and tampering	558.0281588479521
9053. closely related to this	function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate	ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal	ends	3101.348734808532
9054. this something leads to a conception of an over-all social	plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends; for example	a plan that fulfills the will of god which advances the kingdom	of god which involves social life as part of the grand design	7031.94724009169
9055. this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their	primacy	638.356008819385
9056. it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs	of social action	1176.6267809995138
9057. finally it gives meaning to much social endeavor	and logic consistency and meaning to life	1099.414048295652
9058. in general there is no	society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired	transcendental ends	2117.9946184604055
9059. some	of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings	have grown out of religion	1559.731392711103
9060. these groups have varied widely from	mere families primitive totemic groups and small modern cults and	sects to the memberships of great denominations and great widely	dispersed world religions	4676.296927799887
9061. religion fosters group life in various ways	93.51300117835993
9062. the common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are	a most important factor	1637.1453685259416
9063. without a system of values there can be no	society	371.7773693537226
9064. where such a value system prevails it always unifies all	who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system	3679.338053612473
9065. the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed	in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what durkheim calls a credo	2340.29112619414
9066. as he points out a religious group cannot exist without a collective	credo and the more extensive the credo the more unified and strong	is the group	4327.153429905395
9067. the credo unifies and socializes men by attaching	them completely to an identical body of doctrine; the more extensive	and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group	3123.4709173887777
9068. the religious	symbolism and especially the closely related rites and worship	forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith	3499.199096208774
9069. the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group	small or large	1255.89726831473
9070. the common codes for religious action as such and	in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees	together	3039.7015151604096
9071. these are ways of jointly participating in significantly	symbolized standardized and ordered religiously sanctified behavior	1089.0211319159584
9072. the codes are mechanism for training in and directing and enforcing	uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reasserting	the solidarity of the group	3911.2987105610773
9073. durkheim noted long ago that	religion as h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative	to sacred things h unites into one single moral community h	all	those who adhere to them	3552.160391363478
9074. his view is that every religion pertains	to	a community and conversely every community is in one aspect a religious	unit	3059.3742337920485
9075. this is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails	even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular	semi-public and public occasions in the united states; and it is	evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions	and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds	4956.20637351705
9076. the	unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically	peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural	units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed	and not politically organized	6218.9210063289565
9077. the jews for 2500 years have been	a prime example though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion	are cases in point	2331.9732861120406
9078. it might be pointed out that the integrating	function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been	identified with other groupings- political nationality language class	racial sociability even economic	5160.70618215342
9079. religion usually exercises	a stabilizing-conserving function	43.64223099372494
9080. as such it acts as an anchor	for the people	564.4753610325067
9081. there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly	established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies	and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance	3322.529787528313
9082. it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of	social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation	or diffusion of new ones	4482.882273563758
9083. it tends to support the longstanding precious	sentiments the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways	of living	1736.308437332635
9084. as yinger has pointed out the h reliance on symbols	on tradition on sacred writings on the cultivation of emotional	feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the	past far more than to the future	6205.651124112204
9085. historically religion has also	functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction	and perpetuation of various other institutions	1724.161746291834
9086. at the same	time that religion exercises a conserving influence it also energizes	and motivates both individuals and groups	2600.900375135775
9087. much of the important	individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives	943.938605979313
9088. the	great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon	lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force	mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices; for example the crusades	mission efforts just wars	5657.924619644304
9089. much effort has been expended in the	sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion	1422.2519681105769
9090. the	insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating	effects	958.7128614470006
9091. religion provides the most attractive rewards either	in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms	but who engage in good works	2965.6499769790057
9092. religion usually acts as a	powerful	aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not	do	2372.661532551481
9093. among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were	more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group;	and in modern societies such influence is still great	3331.1723535334095
9094. religion has	its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes	of behavior for the here and now	2819.1235670937403
9095. overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about	persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income	her defense of denial was excessively strong	2857.7567968077415
9096. thus the lack of effective	recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two	babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem	3260.267127508302
9097. the result dramatically	visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily	functioning was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall	the second twin whose birth had not been anticipated	3665.2506500626164
9098. soon mrs	b's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning	the welfare of the entire family	2369.978741890082
9099. inability to care for the other	children difficulty in feeding the babies who seemed colicky bone-weary	fatigue repeated crying episodes and short tempers reflected	the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation	3547.474015942499
9100. clearly	this was a family in crisis	141.23825972666077
9101. mrs b compared her	feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at	the time of her mother's death when she was eight as well as her subsequent	anger at her father for remarrying	3834.678252300438
9102. her previous traumatic experiences	flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday	1416.3986993947228
9103. on the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized	tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral	2314.4596369230017
9104. in the family's own words they	had reached the crisis peak- either the situation will give or	we	will break!   direct confrontation and acceptance of mrs	b's anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears	of annihilation	6061.135861772849
9105. abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the	death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger	and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further	relief of tension	3648.411112613335
9106. in a joint interview mr and mrs b were	helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away	from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the	arrival of the twins	5924.589139303119
9107. the father accurately perceiving the child's	needs not only respected them as worthy of his attention but immediately	satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins	saying i have a big lap; there is room for you too johnnie	4467.624812226022
9108. simultaneously a variety of environmental supports- a calm but	not	too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent	use of nursing care accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical	advice on the twins' feeding problem- combined to prevent further	development of predictable pathological mechanisms	6900.110478865909
9109. follow-up visits	of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the	care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's	day-to-day mental health and social functioning	3571.7086153557793
9110. as seen	in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop	conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a	formal request for assistance	5004.438453070462
9111. the lack of awareness usually springs	from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the superficial guise	of not knowing or not caring	2176.6719422112565
9112. the unhealthy use of denial	in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium	of a positive controlled transference	3484.733186611501
9113. in general the approach is	more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective	795.3284084292874
9114. while some	regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged	so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression	associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic	model for insight therapy	5629.209496863126
9115. to establish an emotionally meaningful	relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness	immediately preferably within the first interview by meeting	the client's specific needs	2732.082803942184
9116. these needs usually concern the reduction	of guilt and some relief of tension	1184.377969910875
9117. the initial interview must	be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking	sense	941.9562675633146
9118. in this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate	confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem	2359.2395296341238
9119. in	so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind	of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness	generally associated with the first stages of stress impact	3561.830537017803
9120. thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive	efforts on his own behalf	1884.575400176363
9121. here there is a specific preventive component	which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation	1568.36713670892
9122. we are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue	regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of	denial and crippling guilt turned against the self	4114.311680040901
9123. while some suppression	and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the worker's	clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used	what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated and when	efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed	4544.187116288542
9124. in steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive	responses the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques	of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance	4107.183705863296
9125. over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve	weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth	between immediate external stressful exigencies	and the key emotionally relevant issues	which are often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivated	by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution	5311.446032048485
9126. though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they	do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the	spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments	5172.48173184536
9127. then too the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously	combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits single and group	office interviews and appropriate telephone follow-up calls if	the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy	outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles	of preventive intervention	5150.600484476944
9128. in addition in many cases a variety of	concrete social resources- homemaker day care medical and financial	aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to	bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative	efforts	6310.035829559712
9129. at certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic	reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use	of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive	rather than defeating	3735.4335053394875
9130. while expensive in time and involving	a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker	willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into	techniques of accompaniment were found to be of	tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives	7102.154381545857
9131. finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all	preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the	stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family	members to mobilize and use their ego capacities	4458.846102109501
9132. having outlined	an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we	now address ourselves to our final question: what place should brief	crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of	services	5474.885596874787
9133. we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy	of values locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term	intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part	of a continuum each important in its own right	4286.235182596089
9134. this problem is perhaps	as old as social casework itself	562.1772238811163
9135. almost three decades ago bertha	reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of	her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected	place in our network of social services	3327.2221991658553
9136. her conclusion has been borne	out in the experience of many practitioners: h short-contact	interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but	is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work	5786.182508406709
9137. thus	casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be	regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the	quantity of time expended	3079.515865201569
9138. that we are experiencing an upsurge	of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of	brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling	of current literature	4997.764885178574
9139. especially noteworthy is levinger's finding	that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of	successful outcome	1878.473655794964
9140. according to a number of studies the important	predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as	well as the accessibility of the helping person	4291.625201632179
9141. for example the level	of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of	immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably	with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where	the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the	number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental	project	5412.001398617218
9142. of startling significance too is the assertion that	it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition	rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable	group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated	child guidance services	7202.905552221702
9143. these reports refer to a level of secondary	prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route	of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people	3229.152549423563
9144. similarities to the approach which i have described are evident in	the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick appraisal of	key issues and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the	essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in	dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses	7629.191959308741
9145. while there	are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention	the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings	all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's	initial need for help	4031.5039061242396
9146. in some programs treatment is concentrated	over a short period of time while in others after the initial	contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally	used with apparent success	5173.370060622773
9147. willingness to take the risk of	early and direct interpretation	is another prominent	feature in these efforts	1424.116019469821
9148. my aim in mentioning this factor obviously	is not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage	us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess	and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional	pride	6424.917306830407
9149. though there is obviously great need for continued	experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further	efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at	the secondary- or perhaps in some instances primary- level the	place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number	of investigators in a wide variety of settings	5259.389793159639
9150. woodward for example	has emphasized the need for a broad spectrum of services including	very brief services in connection with critical situations	3277.9728999225526
9151. ideally	brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice	rather	than as a treatment of chance	1723.445646874945
9152. moreover the shortage of treatment	resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower	force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention	techniques to make services more widely available- and on a	more effective basis to more people	6338.920436566839
9153. further research in the meaning	of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework	services- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures	crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment	approaches- and the establishment of new experimental programs are	imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers	in collaboration with community planners	5393.834807940906
9154. our literature	is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive	agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the	globally utopian	3682.957125024774
9155. probably in the immediate future we will have to	settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models	1719.451211253853
9156. increased	experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those	that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare	services holds rich promise for the future	3882.240327298093
9157. for example child welfare	experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for	substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully	linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships	3670.209399122763
9158. tension management and communication of sentiment	are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment	or feeling	2819.1116962053793
9159. one of the devices for tension management is preferential	mating	375.3044814566048
9160. the preferential mating of this particular population	has been analyzed in a separate study	1414.299819075522
9161. the relative geographical isolation	of the brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating	1098.8321104443935
9162. it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support	for one another since it is not provided by the larger society	3467.6703312012564
9163. the	supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and	social isolation	644.147213750605
9164. the newlyweds building homes on the same land with	either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the	population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive	relationship	5309.832137745068
9165. as loomis remarks in the internal pattern	the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking friendship	and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another	and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic	relations	4192.936590015752
9166. maintenance of the status	quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population	today	2356.755144174796
9167. yet the object of the element of achieving through the	process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed	by circumstances brought about by the war	3092.88724575922
9168. prior to world war	2 there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after	world war 2	2348.0624010071137
9169. the norms as elements refer	to all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual	and group actions in any social system	2459.600152889273
9170. the process of evaluation	assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements	1412.8002424833762
9171. the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate	selection in this population	1091.3542203057555
9172. from the evidence it may be conjectured	that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and	females; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of	permissive unions; and core-negro marriages are proscribed for core	members	5905.945086377304
9173. the element of status-roles and associated	processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population	to permit any type of conjectures about them	2306.0006427803874
9174. there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members	of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary	influence of non-authoritative power has been exerted on actors in	the system particularly in regard to mate selection	6429.857093790279
9175. this would seem	to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal	status of that family	1887.8597967599449
9176. again size of the group may have	some influence on the strength of group controls	1647.435524107991
9177. interviews	with members of the brandywine population were attempted in	order	to discover the ranking of the various families in the population	2164.9646778944816
9178. the large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the	upper positions	1185.8154224997802
9179. loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation	process	262.1460854981428
9180. the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system	is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in	accordance with the norms and standards of the system	5500.362753810233
9181. despite the	increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able	to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate	status in society	2862.722198823815
9182. to some extent the system can be considered	a gemeinschaft in which social-role occupancies are determined	by birth by attributes such as sex or caste which are biologically	or socially immutable	5007.425151406709
9183. the adherence of many in the population to	the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact	that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest	in	determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate	status of the group in society	4821.741296776732
9184. the negative	sanctions applied to core-negro marriages for core members act as	indicators of expected adherence to group norms	2595.3251879839922
9185. however because of	church laws lately more stringently enforced which forbid the marriage	of cousins closely related consanguineously a means of facilitating	the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate	unions	3739.3110413903137
9186. a cursory survey of available material indicates a high	rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous	relationship	3241.868123095075
9187. the comprehensive or master	processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system	and subsystems	1579.3494362347167
9188. within the larger social system are the structural	and functional subsystems	753.4128767423251
9189. the structural subsystem consisting of	relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts includes:	subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms	1870.6934335299634
9190. roles of various types within the larger system and within	the subgroups h  regulative norms governing subgroups and	roles	2601.103624146064
9191. in the study of marriage	patterns for this group consanguinity produces the structural system-	a system of affinities- which in turn maintains the system of	consanguinity	2702.9755699375464
9192. subgroups of various types have been found within this	system	559.1089670771032
9193. each family line can be considered a substructure	167.28767581919536
9194. there seems	to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status	within the group	2378.651463020603
9195. additionally the proscription of core-negro marriages	for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative	norm governing subgroups and roles	2323.695747457491
9196. the scope of this study does	not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger	system or within the subgroups	3699.1254050136827
9197. however it cannot be presumed informal	though the structure of the population seems that there are not	well-defined roles within the system	2173.533927586136
9198. the present study relates	to the theory of functional systems	557.7758274861195
9199. it is hypothesized that fertility	is a function of the social system when the population as a whole	is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division	of core families and marginal families is considered	4062.3595731569867
9200. the four	functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by	the subsystems within this population	2594.6423348746903
9201. by means of geographical isolation	and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern	of isolation from the greater society maintained	2342.3645038308177
9202. in order to attain	the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility	rate provides more group members for mate selection and the clustering	of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls	5769.288993486621
9203. to	maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not	only necessary that members of this population be visible but	that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct	grouping or system in society	4198.14197604073
9204. as mentioned above where families	are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and	most effective	2119.152126464239
9205. adaptation to the social and non-social environment	through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational	segregation	2184.1917706811805
9206. this provides the necessary contact with the larger	society while supporting a type of control over members in terms	of social contacts	3258.61436034971
9207. integration has to do with the inter-relation	of parts	262.3388093716554
9208. the problem of solidarity and morale again involves	the concept of values	958.1871484760419
9209. the values placed by the brandywine population	upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial	identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important	for the morale of the system	3480.3412788366236
9210. since morale is closely related to	pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity	the better the system can solve the problems of the system	4303.913286653204
9211. in this	respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between	the brandywine population and the white and negro populations within	the same general locality the greater the possibility for higher morale	and solidarity within the brandywine population	4229.306502929555
9212. it is conceived	that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical	and social isolation	2824.1919780259836
9213. in turn higher fertility rates for this population	provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the	population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity	2971.8069971425075
9214. the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger	560.5544964543569
9215. of particular utility in the analysis of the	development persistence and change of social systems has been the	use of the master or comprehensive processes	2589.6384296343026
9216. loomis considers six such	processes in his paradigm	247.670413442082
9217. boundary	maintenance   3	0.20041515
9218. social control   6	0.30041514999999996
9219. institutionalization though undoubtedly	all six processes are operative within the whole social system	and its subsystems two processes that are of crucial importance to	this study will be singled out for particular emphasis:	in discussing the process of communication loomis defines	it as the process by which information decisions and directives	are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions	and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction	0.20124717349522497
9220. communication	may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger	community	1405.8251381023342
9221. intense interaction is easier where segregated living and	occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community	as in the case of this population	2854.7281275681976
9222. however the factor of physical	isolation is not a static situation	755.4222352371335
9223. although the brandywine population	is still predominantly rural there are indications of a consistent	and a statistically significant trend away from the older and	relatively isolated rural communities h urbanization appears to be	an important factor in the disintegration of this group	4395.225210348062
9224. this conclusion	is however an over-simplification	65.14190498643363
9225. a more realistic analysis must	take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe	area are in general less segregated locally than group members	in rural areas	3079.386663117293
9226. in the urban area in other words they unlike some	urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto colonies	2586.546948240272
9227. group pressures	toward conformity are slight or non-existent and deviant behavior	in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions	1887.0874474807472
9228. in such a setting	social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous	resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection	behavior	4062.9199934345515
9229. to the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown	of the group patterns of residential isolation to that extent it	contributes directly to increased exogamy	2714.2278903306456
9230. the process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play	a part in the individual's behavior as well as the group's behavior	3493.6119487767382
9231. by means of this social control deviance is either eliminated	or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group	2040.081934818048
9232. examples	from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned	by ostracism from the group	1873.2291437379713
9233. there is an oral	tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin	and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society	2871.29375625171
9234. confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important	part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a	means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community	5773.486283854945
9235. the fact of indian ancestry and free status during the days	of slavery are important distinctions made by members of the group	2187.364504497968
9236. culturally induced social cohesion resulting	from common norms and values internalized by members of the group	is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well	as in the process of socialization	5327.685790178054
9237. the process of boundary maintenance	identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic	interaction is maintained	1747.6962845312726
9238. as the threat of encroachment	on the system increases the probability of applied boundary maintenance	mechanisms increases	2113.3377124834865
9239. the fertility rate pattern would	seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining	the boundary	2038.8065323622147
9240. increased boundary maintenance may be achieved	for example by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities	characteristic of the external pattern h the external pattern	or external system can be considered as group behavior that enables	the group to survive in its environment h boundary maintenance	for	this group would seem to be primarily social as is the preference	for endogamy	8420.832974654573
9241. it is also expressed in the proscription against deviants	in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas	1565.0897410862403
9242. by their	pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core families and the marginal families	show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain	3502.5158704102914
9243. where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries	or limits of the group systemic linkage is defined as the	process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems	is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways	and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit	5274.431603567738
9244. a royal decree issued in 1910 two years after the belgian government	assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed	the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms	4663.67864819727
9245. further decrees	along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919	496.0445398175834
9246. in 1922 a continuous	registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance	of the governor-general and the periodic compilation of these	records was ordered	4079.8935608073507
9247. but specific procedures for carrying out this	plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors	1408.5559042994175
9248. a unified	set of regulations applicable to all areas was issued in 1929 and	a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was	instituted at the same time	4630.375110068114
9249. the whole system was again reviewed and	reorganized in 1933	374.2547532201617
9250. general responsibility for its administration rested	with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor	supply and native affairs service des affaires indigenes et de la	main-d'oeuvre		3220.70982392373
9251. tribal authorities the chiefs and their	secretaries were held responsible for maintaining the registers of	indigenous persons within their territories under the general supervision	of district officials	2856.127375467816
9252. the district officials along with their	other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in	selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic	statistics	4285.088859047073
9253. the regulations require the inscription of each	individual	167.3018812152298
9254. the cards filed by circonscription	are kept in the headquarters of each territoire	1177.7566619784727
9255. each	card is expected to show certain information about the individual	concerned including his or her date of birth	spouses and children	2186.226729284129
9256. additional entries must be made from time	to time	391.7455720544582
9257. different cards are used for males and females and a corner	is clipped from the cards of adults and of children when they reach	puberty	2602.123133678847
9258. so a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate	clerk of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes	3898.727767062672
9259. personal identification cards are issued to all adult males	on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes	of residence are recorded	2304.152739897712
9260. similar identification cards were issued	in 1959 to all adult females	747.424250619479
9261. each adult is held personally responsible	for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card	which must be shown on demand	2036.999120386754
9262. the registration card of a person leaving	his home territory for a short period is put into a special file	for absent persons	3490.083355093273
9263. the cards of permanent out-migrants are in theory	sent to an office in the place of new residence	1574.4092184121148
9264. finally the registration	of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory	in most regions	1868.9541467294312
9265. numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes were counted each year	638.8916833475051
9266. in addition demographic inquiries	supposedly involving field investigations were conducted in selected	minor divisions containing about 3 percent	of the total population	3249.283212414741
9267. the results of these inquiries were used to	adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various	ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general	fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives	separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households infant mortality	and migration	4895.836569914945
9268. the areas to be examined in these inquiries were	selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger	population	2814.576482756273
9269. averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas	were applied to the larger population	1251.382491168652
9270. the scheme in theory	is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions	of african life	2356.805630026879
9271. but it places a severe strain on the administrative	resources of a widely dispersed	poor and largely illiterate population	1731.0648594703391
9272. the sampling program was	instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely	recognized in population studies	2097.1966563282836
9273. the system was not well adapted to	conditions of life in urban centers	784.0465264953557
9274. the distinction between domiciled	and present population was not clearly	defined	748.2200658313077
9275. so the results are subject to considerable confusion	167.09083647247823
9276. the	system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated; it	had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951	3248.113547029584
9277. in spite of the	defects in this system the figures on total population during the late	1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual	conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity	3750.0612887974394
9278. but the	information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading	955.5210858198791
9279. the same system with minor modifications was developed in ruanda-urundi	under belgian administration	787.6253256762975
9280. here again it seems that	useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the	population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war	periods	4636.693242348813
9281. before considering more recent activities we	should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa	1243.692608559677
9282. a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases	with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social	educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo	and ruanda-urundi	5174.846733399734
9283. the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour l'assistance	medicale aux indigenes du congo belge	has special interest with respect to demography	2040.080416738939
9284. this agency accepted	responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from	638560 persons in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the kwango district	and adjacent areas east of leopoldville	4814.3707861138655
9285. each year from 1941 on its	medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine	changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary	objective the incidence of major diseases	3453.918736378268
9286. its findings are reported	each year in its rapport sur l'activite pendant annee h	1415.4429457395702
9287. somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical	officers in other areas	638.9632322807528
9288. other independent or partially independent	agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly	related to demography	2121.333233666742
9289. these studies vary widely in scope and precision	165.76854623816143
9290. l'institut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale	has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has	cooperated closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development	of its official statistics	4672.984341107244
9291. a massive investigation	of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in	ruanda-urundi is being carried on by j j maquet former director	of the social science branch of irsac now a professor	at l'universite officielle du congo belge et du ruanda-urundi	4389.431986850818
9292. some 30000 completed schedules with 20 items	have been tabulated	558.4286158488464
9293. the results are	now being analyzed	43.726324774723096
9294. statistics have been recognized as a matter	of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during	the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs	4477.678825024097
9295. the aimo organizations of both countries which maintain	administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate	responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information	2452.454983561471
9296. however the statistical offices of both governments were	assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics	2355.8344910552005
9297. a bureau de la demographie was formed	under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the	section statistique of the secretariat general	2594.6745800321305
9298. eventually responsibility	for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to	the demographic division of the central statistical office	2595.0106079781935
9299. the 1952	demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi was directed by v neesen	a member of the irsac staff though the inquiry was carried	out under the auspices of aimo which has continuing responsibility	for demographic statistics in this territory	4032.2391443937313
9300. a member of the	irsac staff was recently delegated to cooperate	with aimo in the development of demographic statistics	in this territory	3260.7922935123306
9301. the initiation of sampling censuses in ruanda-urundi	and in the congo were major advances	944.6529937250249
9302. we	will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into	operation later than the other	2831.222367705289
9303. the radical nature of the	innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements	1261.4588440426037
9304. the term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary	investigations carried out in connection with the administrative	censuses was used for the new investigations	3681.461953716526
9305. however the differences	field operations were transferred from	administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially	trained teams	of full-time african investigators		1571.4455800708884
9306. these teams carried out the same operations	successively in different areas	745.1616074082938
9307. sample	areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application	of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative	of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits	3435.2016769273964
9308. in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective	sampling	747.2504909580373
9309. the populations of the various districts or other major divisions	were stratified by type of community and	where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy	2854.244773841322
9310. sample	units were drawn systematically	within these strata	251.89266497803033
9311. different	sampling ratios were applied under different conditions	166.171003596157
9312. higher	proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural	areas	1175.663984764468
9313. about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new	investigation as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries	2317.592318618765
9314. uniform questions definitions	and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country	752.7890860621594
9315. data	were obtained separately on three classes of persons: residents	present; visitors	636.7746378899317
9316. in the	reports summary results are given for both the de facto	and de jure populations; but the subsequent analysis	of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population		3536.816249737486
9317. these	changes represent in effect a shift from an administrative compilation	of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve	political and economic objectives to a systematic sampling census	of the whole african population	3664.3604654660476
9318. the population registration	system still has important functions	248.1869490502163
9319. it supplies local data which are	useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive	studies in particular situations	2331.4182981807053
9320. it provides a frame for the sampling	census	250.34308828515947
9321. it also provides a frame within which the registration	of vital events is gradually gaining force	obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this		2145.1371890482224
9322. it is still used in making current population	estimates in post-census years though the value of these estimates	is open to question	3278.449780224327
9323. finally it may have certain very important	less obvious values	371.87369879719864
9324. even though the registers may have an incomplete	record of persons present in a particular area or include persons	no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date	of birth for some of the persons present	and supplementary information	for many others	6902.2489821490335
9325. the quality of the census	data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration	records in conjunction with the field inquiries	2470.0611476743297
9326. furthermore it may	be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method	in each of these sources on such subjects	as fertility mortality and migration during a given interval by using	information from two largely independent sources in conjunction	6457.407101817749
9327. the first sampling census in the congo extended over a three-year	period 1955-57; the results were still being processed in 1959	2042.0012983064673
9328. it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved	equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry	can be carried through in one year and the results published more	expeditiously	6299.013519241999
9329. it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses	be carried out at five-year intervals	1250.1263913996886
9330. reports already	issued on the sampling census 1955-57 in various areas run as follows	:		493.07671089194736
9331. this report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables	166.92195959504124
9332. other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content	have been issued for: 	797.6292026025187
9333. these area reports will be	followed according to present plans by a summary report which will	include a detailed statement on methods	2174.195675539954
9334. with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might	more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes	3484.3229104337543
9335. toward the end of the semester's work he interviewed every	married class member at great length	1254.8636806691943
9336. he found as he had suspected	a	general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed	course was not really functional for these students	4091.7491205158453
9337. however	all admitted that the hind sight was not altogether lost	497.63199512510494
9338. in their	own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they	had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some	insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time	5921.762747106461
9339. in fact	they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design	a section exclusively for married students there should be at	the beginning some hind sight study; but they all hastened to	add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent	4944.144069304651
9340. all of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could	be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course	3895.868247684158
9341. a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section	for married students	943.0228429504626
9342. as one of them expressed it it has done me	a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of	these not-yet-married people	4090.147735501836
9343. i can now better see just what processes	provoked certain actions from me in the past	1263.496073309776
9344. had i been in an all-married	section i would have missed this and i believe that this single	aspect has been of great personal value to me	4281.434521032585
9345. this comment	and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification	for continuing the status quo	1730.5315464219104
9346. but the weight of feeling was heavily	in the opposite direction	747.1313268201333
9347. thus the writer decided to hold one experimental	section of the functional preparation for marriage course	in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married-	that is prerequisite: marriage	3332.7507573302355
9348. this did not mean that married	students could not enroll in other mixed sections and some	of them largely because of scheduling difficulties did	3686.930302854483
9349. but only	those already married could enroll in this one section	499.68803555827697
9350. in addition	the regular sections do not allow freshmen; this one did	956.8693464760581
9351. this action	was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that	a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become	sophomores	2843.5348634129286
9352. many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another	956.7509424641688
9353. by permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity	for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get	auditors were encouraged	2454.1630398121165
9354. in the regular sections they have always	been more or less discouraged	959.6760236340018
9355. the philosophy has been that if they could	find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit	and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively	3555.3562992473962
9356. besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight	as regularly enrolled students	1882.9566986415762
9357. but in this one section we welcomed	auditors	166.63162567612974
9358. why	0.30041514999999996
9359. for no particular reason other than that the writer	felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in attendance	2024.825553457237
9360. many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially	in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior	year	3900.213331239612
9361. incidentally it needs to be noted that because auditors were	permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until	at last it swelled to such proportions that this free auditing	policy had to be retracted	3837.430523349015
9362. after that we began to get visitors	to class	388.1874777309453
9363. this experimental class represented quite a variety	of students	262.8776013986995
9364. it ranged from a freshman woman just married through	the various academic growth stages including one senior-graduate student	to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also	attended	5188.234113059478
9365. it ranged from those with no children through students	in various stages of pregnancy to one 44-year-old male with four children	three of whom were teenagers	2724.4627372520417
9366. it ranged from two women members	who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married	and seemingly unable to conceive	3269.896174356637
9367. one might digress at	this point and speculate that if it is wise to create special sections	for special status then why not a special section for women pregnant	before marriage and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children	and so on	4375.406087909925
9368. some of these speculations may have some merit others	are somewhat ambiguous	958.9744772020877
9369. but few who have experienced marriage can dispute	the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different	in marriage than in a pre-marital situation	2594.700026727499
9370. the writer	began this special class by explaining his background thinking for	creating such a section in the first place	2821.9412001702212
9371. he made it clear from the	beginning that this was the students' opportunity and that the future	destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one	2989.004752382819
9372. he did build a framework of academic respectability and one	which did not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other	existing campus course	3682.2392889979283
9373. this is to say that this was not a course	in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise	children	2592.178189790016
9374. we already have courses covering those problems and so on	563.8438292761773
9375. but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible	643.3260628195719
9376. a steering committee of students was organized on the first day	whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate	the direction and pace the class was taking	5010.886205632706
9377. the writer being	cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married	students did insist on there being included some hind sight material	2445.986960768354
9378. but the greater part of semester time was actually centered around	the attitudes so we are married- now how do we make the best	of it	4083.231440727387
9379. or how do we enrich our already fine marriage	261.08074530331567
9380. films were used as with all sections but with one big difference	963.8286499183956
9381. our campus unfortunately owns no films	43.26105663094337
9382. since they are all	either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to	be far in advance	2802.7906782143646
9383. the writer never knew from week to week just where	the section might be	945.6410158085334
9384. for example the steering committee might announce	that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for	an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched	5146.71733154073
9385. since	the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning	he had to go along with their decision- after of course pointing	out	whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one	3870.984657840004
9386. thus the	films seen as they came in	were often out of context	1174.3437263654473
9387. nevertheless the writer has never experienced	such spontaneity of discussion after film showings	790.9087036060039
9388. though	it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group	had sprung up within the class	3060.327465257332
9389. they began to meet in the evenings and	carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered	in class	1868.6287542427199
9390. from a few students this group gradually increased to include	over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class and	many outsiders as well	3696.840217025879
9391. also although only a few of the students were	intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported	that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships	were with members of that class	3840.71550388953
9392. in fact they often revamped	their social activities to include class members previously unknown	1408.0462550056852
9393. supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the	other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably	deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group	3452.1818925970647
9394. these students although they might read various articles in popular	magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals	3242.3318000904947
9395. in addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles	there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read	1873.5065923553798
9396. whereas	a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read	other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different	direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas	and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest	7318.40493836598
9397. since	the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered	throughout the various sections previous to this experiment	nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in single sections	he can only conclude that there must have been something contagious	within the specific group which caused this to occur	5179.656519911945
9398. in the main this course took the following directional high roads:	a great deal of time was spent on processes for solving	marital differences	3691.3811636036444
9399. this was not a search for a magic formula	but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially	to all types of communication in marriage	2599.373298397507
9400. in short it was centered	around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy	1415.1829789457274
9401. not until	the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further	specific adjustment areas such as sex in-laws religion	these same areas	in relation to their own future family life stages developing these	to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to	confront them at some time or other	5308.080656009735
9402. as an example of this last	facet there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement	1639.2792546425703
9403. mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of	one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward	but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked	3559.7375182404758
9404. since	the course one member has lost her husband	390.6965881268071
9405. this was not a particularly	shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her	that it might happen	1718.903020460572
9406. but just when was an unknown and of course the	longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might	not	3876.7328913466663
9407. since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer	on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were	to her in this adjustment crisis	2722.830720932964
9408. quite frequently class members	brought questions from their mates at home	756.558588261513
9409. these were often carefully	written out with a great deal of thought behind them	938.2764734431854
9410. this added	a personal zest to class discussions and participation	560.6310360813735
9411. both	sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage	were extremely enlightening	947.9740302164403
9412. the writer sensed a much freer and more	frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before	2358.8311143399096
9413. he	felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men	in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so	essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might	think	4140.2544244556875
9414. this was probably much more meaningful because all the women	in the class emphasized it time and again	2358.09688042542
9415. on the other hand the	women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than	have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males	as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with	love as most women seem to do	4966.030282550671
9416. in the reproductive area it could	be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students	had previously in mixed marital status sections	3894.8122437081183
9417. perhaps this	was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent	1245.613369255891
9418. never	in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth	discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various	stages of pregnancy	3897.2725214964544
9419. there was a particularly marvelous opportunity	for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented	from a childless couple to and including every trimester	2982.7102553159657
9420. in fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student	had to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the	safe side	5012.699798727226
9421. there was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester	262.8784460393965
9422. thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference	between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief	structuring experience	4298.374730514432
9423. it was predicted that kohnstamm-negative	subjects would adhere to more liberal concretistic reports	of what the ambiguous figure looked like as reflecting their	hesitancy about taking chances	2880.251542307445
9424. this was true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative	subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people	in action	2579.551954258474
9425. responses such as rope with a loop in it and two	guilford-martin	the three personality inventories	stdcr; guilford-martin gamin; guilford-martin	were filled out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive	subjects and 19 of the kohnstamm-negative subjects	3751.9842569636835
9426. these were the	same subjects who were given the rorschach test	749.6316752816025
9427. some predictions	had been made concerning factors r n i and co on these	inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security	aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as	being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity	4202.975510645441
9428. only	co differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level		652.3846816629233
9429. one prediction had been made about the difference	in	security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm	reactivity when informed and those who did not	2839.416262388273
9430. the nonreactors	had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably	secure nonreactors and secure reactors being used	as the groups for comparative personality studies	4506.87343041042
9431. it was predicted	that those who shifted in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly	from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators	refer to as the inferiority factor	3434.494046206054
9432. all of the subjects	in the kohnstamm-negative and kohnstamm-positive groups	were compared with those subjects	who shifted in conditions 3 or 4	3247.6416131413434
9433. a t test on these	two groups shifters vs nonshifters gave a t value of 2	1260.1557528416865
9434. 405	which	is significant on the two-tail test at the 	283.3271060004713
9435. individual differences in kohnstamm	reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the	subjects used in the study	1566.2201507176283
9436. only 27% gave a positive	kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon	1197.0595769976205
9437. there were 49% who did not give a positive reaction	even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and	had been given a demonstration	2989.7089663600354
9438. there were 24% who	shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured	as to the normalcy of the kohnstamm-positive reaction	3697.584874296174
9439. among	this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind	of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred	2176.749428468073
9440. one subject	changed when given only the information that some people have something	happen to their arm when they relax	2813.8791897860574
9441. five subjects did	not change until they had been told that some people have something	happen to their arm what that something was and also were given a	demonstration	3084.459967009775
9442. four subjects did not change even then but needed	the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances	was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed	while others did not	5176.036273008828
9443. at no time was it implied by the experimenter	that the subject's initial reaction was deviant	1255.0211104841292
9444. the subjects were	only given information about other possibilities of normal reaction	970.5796955227706
9445. those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state	did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal	people who did not react in this fashion	3197.053106334483
9446. this information was accepted	with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not	show arm-levitation must be preventing it	2803.9906030201887
9447. these subjects implied that	they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried	1092.9478720367974
9448. the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1	is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility		1296.595263052946
9449. in no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter	indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary	contraction	2325.5052800059075
9450. moreover when the experimenter did inform those	subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm	rise once they relaxed the kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced	in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation	5871.3273049083355
9451. they	continued to give an arm-elevation	44.00133001933111
9452. a differential suggestibility would	have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information	to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute	their nai^ve kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion	4809.303326172483
9453. autosuggestibility	the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own	expectations of the outcome	to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction because of his	also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following	reasons: the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise	when their arms rose and manifestations of the phenomenon despite	anticipations of something else happening	and maybe falling an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one		0.20124717349522497
9454. a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate	as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they	were informed of the possibilities of normal reactions different	from those which they gave	4986.019973253105
9455. while they were told that there were some	normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed	that there were other normals who reacted as they had	3191.3313788584805
9456. there	was no implication made that their initial reaction	was less preferred than the presence of levitation	2119.3600148267105
9457. a more	tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge	and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible	for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax since any reaction	seemed acceptable to the examiner as normal	4544.304209802131
9458. the	nai^ve state condition 1 could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting	one for 24% of the subjects in this study	3052.367387437994
9459. they were not free	to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there	was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable	behavior	3112.900975073788
9460. instructions to relax ie to be spontaneous	and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently	reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions	had been given	5165.634041479762
9461. while other conditions might be even more effective	in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm	reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would	have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject	which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of	responsibility for his behavior	5367.84441700876
9462. alcohol ingestion succeeded in	changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject		802.0955567001431
9463. this subject who	has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did	not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized	conditions used in this experiment while sober	3331.726824395317
9464. after two drinks	containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely	748.640418946305
9465. there was evident	delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of	the freedom of movement	1869.2974567298938
9466. she described herself as having the same kind	of irresponsible feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis	2366.40245740738
9467. she ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect	they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which	she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might	seem appropriate to relax these controls	4114.268407086671
9468. many subjects attributed	differences	in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective	control- voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived	it and involuntary as the kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it	4629.055847156077
9469. these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously	when they were told that there were people who reacted differently	than they had	2295.801025413061
9470. the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid	experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no	control	2818.272461524154
9471. they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention	of control factors	1094.8940496971566
9472. they felt that they too could counteract	the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced	the reaction	3277.9782201854373
9473. some of those who did not initially react with	an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with	control factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily	2855.5780045501006
9474. one subject spontaneously asked do	you suppose i was unconsciously keeping it down before	1403.3921148966758
9475. another	said that her arm did not go up at first because i wouldn't	let it; i thought it wasn't supposed to	2163.557612585312
9476. this subject was	one	who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but	not in the first	3052.200789208616
9477. she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the	first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing	2183.9335900737674
9478. she	explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were not letting	themselves relax	1395.4257302659144
9479. when informed that there were some persons who	did not have their arm go up she commented i don't see how	they can prevent it	2580.046986452951
9480. in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation	for nonreactivity given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects the	kohnstamm-negative	subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis	to explain nonreactivity	3482.297820595829
9481. they felt that they were relaxing as much as	they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent	response must be on an unconscious level	3080.0644380154795
9482. the above discussion	does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in	abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could	be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation	5118.51667593639
9483. one kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested	in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as	follows: you feel they're going up and you're on a stage and	it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's	what's supposed to happen	4966.056902723341
9484. she then described her experience as	one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of	being in which she relinquished control	3887.4011142381873
9485. however she was able to relax	and yield to the moment	500.4588658824831
9486. it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive	subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are	kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give up their control and	allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors	5296.610624567934
9487. it is our belief	that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the	kohnstamm-positive	subjects in some of the other experimental situations	to be discussed below	2963.547493423098
9488. thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced	in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality	factor	2584.7833141214805
9489. the kohnstamm-positive subjects	seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible	in the external world	1578.8905777563562
9490. there was a significantly greater number	in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while	a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline	4992.818186162205
9491. this	occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going	downhill	1093.5484254505366
9492. they knew that their perceptual experience differed from	objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting	on the aniseikonic lenses	3889.1374823057145
9493. yet they were not so bound by past experience	and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to	be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be	3216.056723533623
9494. the	change in perceptions by some of the kohnstamm-negative subjects	after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions	suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with	their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations	6332.056318372447
9495. they	were able to experience at first in terms of past conventionality	636.9167390264508
9496. when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they	were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present	3034.166296187183
9497. it might	be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong;	that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as threatening	until they are tested and proved otherwise	3218.7724284694477
9498. while	the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they	gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one	of the kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not on the first trial	perceive the tilt illusion	6191.545308354837
9499. it would have been desirable for	the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable	being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method	2861.575920857181
9500. the	structured schools were in an industrial city with three-family tenement	houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable	section of middle-class homes	4073.2612945012625
9501. the unstructured schools were in	a large suburban community predominantly middle- to upper-middle class	but fringed by an industrial area	1866.617477195843
9502. in order to equate the samples	on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis	of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods	3723.961286823075
9503. school principals and guidance	workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research	team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas	2320.8201090819375
9504. an objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from	these data	964.4787323914716
9505. equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from	upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods	1092.6345512312878
9506. individual	differences in maturation and the development of readiness for	learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most	children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school	achievement	5314.098008227554
9507. therefore third-grade children were chosen as subjects	for this study	373.6982921383227
9508. for purposes of sample selection only	we obtained group test scores of reading	achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade	population in each school system	4463.735368659227
9509. the subjects for this study were	randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution one-third	as underachievers one-third medium and one-third over-achievers	2190.864933075396
9510. children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation	below the regression line of each total third-grade school population	were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection	4620.252206908021
9511. over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression	line in their school system	1091.5206968715006
9512. the final sample was not significantly	different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement	or intelligence test scores	2828.52520297451
9513. twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured	schools furnished 156 cases 87 boys and 69 girls	948.6562973023158
9514. eight classrooms	in three structured schools furnished 72 cases 36 boys and 36	girls	1413.0101265216786
9515. administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size	in the structured schools	503.00986508116665
9516. it was assumed that the sampling	procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables	under investigation	2357.6358821023136
9517. an interview	schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire	were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen	in the home	2728.542426949175
9518. the parent was asked to describe the child's typical	behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity	to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self	and others irrational conformity to rules orderliness punctuality	and need for certainty	6425.96775384687
9519. the interviewers were instructed not to suggest	answers and as much as possible to record the parents' actual	words as they described the child's behavior in home situations	2986.38916941015
9520. the rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing	the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity	then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the	case records	4983.908049226496
9521. final ratings were made on the basis of a point system	which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors	recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that	was deviant from the discovered norms	4028.0277119693646
9522. children scoring high in compulsivity	were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations	where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards	and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals	5881.070817565074
9523. the low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned	about such matters	786.238413270735
9524. for instance the following statement was rated	low in compulsivity she's naturally quite neat about things	but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy	4449.381497879946
9525. but she	cleans it up very well when i remind her	499.97031700663393
9526. castaneda et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for	use with children	959.6704447897221
9527. the taylor scale was adapted from the minnesota	multiphastic personality inventory with item selection based upon	clinical definitions of anxiety	1876.4258728860586
9528. there is much research evidence to	validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who	are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees	3639.5755925737312
9529. reliability and validation	work with the children's anxiety scale by castaneda et	al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with	the adult scale	2466.479958162739
9530. although the taylor scale was designed as a group	testing device in this study it was individually administered by psychologically	trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children	in reading the items	5338.443709062391
9531. the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with	a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity	1723.56815656134
9532. the two ratings yield a	correlation of +	65.1337088305755
9533. 04 which is not significantly different from zero;	therefore we have measured two different characteristics	1093.716169636748
9534. in theory	compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect	a negative association except for the possibility that for many	children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell	the amount of anxiety they suffer	6187.581524482775
9535. the issue of interaction between	anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later	784.9105982865366
9536. in the primary grades reading permeates almost every aspect of	school progress and the children's early experiences of success or	failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement	that is relatively enduring throughout the following years	6320.777831064899
9537. in establishing	criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden	the scope beyond the reading act itself	1570.2492278664683
9538. the predicted interaction	effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement	1421.3954519385363
9539. the stanford achievement test form j was administered	by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six sub-tests:	paragraph meaning word meaning spelling language arithmetic	computation and arithmetic reasoning	3098.255717501058
9540. all of these sub-tests	involve reading except arithmetic computation	391.3731990106486
9541. scores are stated	in grade-equivalents on a national norm	262.1464806817317
9542. the battery median grade-equivalent	was used in data analysis in this study	955.960657841674
9543. the wechsler	intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample	third-grade child by a clinical worker	1414.1276843319226
9544. the relationship of intelligence	test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact	; therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis	it was necessary to control this factor	3201.7354019045156
9545. the criterion score	used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement	1099.1030275874662
9546. it is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement	test score and the score that would be predicted by the iq	3043.223122394778
9547. for example on the basis of the regression equation a child with	an iq of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement	test score of 4	3218.1403857430532
9548. if a child with an iq	of 120 scored 5	562.5460669772659
9549. 5 in achievement his discrepancy score would be	+	78.75699486524398
9550. 7 of one year of over-achievement	64.9299666958922
9551. a child with an	iq of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score	of 3	1571.953242413551
9552. if such a child scored 3	65.4799216529221
9553. 0 his discrepancy score would be -	20.160275797943996
9554. 5 of one year of under-achievement	64.71812091483909
9555. in this manner	the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing	discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting	from other variables	2596.063950567895
9556. _test of interaction of compulsivity	tables 1 and 2 present the results of	the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the	descriptive variable	4298.09233296838
9557. figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of	each sub-group graphically	500.9848418613398
9558. first of all as we had surmised the highly	compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly	better on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured	schools	4481.6146547890985
9559. it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity	within the structured schools the high compulsive children do	better	2188.3757918721517
9560. no significant difference was found in achievement between	high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school	2122.1994126611453
9561. the	hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching	method was supported in this case at the 	1093.4971363104853
9562. while	we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school	setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured	we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives	within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning	reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives	7787.328535448997
9563. indeed	their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis	although the difference was not significant	1406.546507482819
9564. we speculate that compulsives	in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of	the lack of systemization in their school setting but that their need	to organize is so intense that they struggle to induce	the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the	environment	7509.6652869501195
9565. it is interesting to note that medium compulsives	in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores		868.1441021401508
9566. possibly their compulsivity was not strong	enough to cause them to build their own structure	1631.552718999536
9567. our conjecture	is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons	are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each	lesson that aid him in systematizing his work	3331.8279467534585
9568. when helped by a high	degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does	test of interaction of anxiety	the statistical analyses of achievement in	relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the	two are presented in tables 3 and 4	7008.443756161444
9569. figure 2 is a graph of the mean	achievement scores of each group	787.6859517466336
9570. as predicted the highly anxious children	in the unstructured schools score more poorly than those	in	the structured schools	2596.308878193023
9571. the interaction effect which is significant	at the 	79.19780112111087
9572. 01 level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores	960.8315811129827
9573. while	high anxiety children achieve significantly less well in the	unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at	least as well as the average in the structured classroom	3441.9314017280167
9574. the	most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement	in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured	schools	3494.4321399816063
9575. according to the theory proposed this is a consequence	of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated	for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment	3216.104693515318
9576. the	fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is	thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or	under-achievement	these children exhibit	4840.413195975818
9577. the child with high anxiety may	first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because	his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and	memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts	to master the problem	4206.308450258742
9578. failure confirms the threat and the intensity	of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more	difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the	decrement in performance is pronounced	5646.799765218317
9579. the individual with high	anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task	with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination	2473.3689191377207
9580. but	the symbols he is asked to learn are simple	562.3350445454898
9581. as shown earlier the	highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple	elements	1249.8706235389518
9582. success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of	discrimination are improved	1171.4555704527272
9583. by the time the child first attacks the	actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with	all of the elements of words	2742.905233557847
9584. apparently academic challenge in the structured	setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high	anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state	without becoming confused or panicked	5792.6100494764105
9585. sarason et al	present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like	situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives	supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher	3439.4904079689686
9586. although the	present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the	results do not confirm their conclusion	2594.536337723377
9587. observers in the two school	systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools	to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the	unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting	3856.2741130827912
9588. yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only	in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average	in the structured setting	4099.337749302854
9589. analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative	ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements	1730.5410556139493
9590. analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding	strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to	eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts	4831.847606160242
9591. up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms	of individuals	937.932636558398
9592. roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose:	to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals	1640.0799588121613
9593. for example:	a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying	644.7758007481134
9594. let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones	we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation	and analysis	3477.1502447362486
9595. one should keep in mind that many of the exciting	possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been	used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other	areas	3752.8823864721226
9596. the president of a small firm selling restaurant	products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen	for his business	2597.9648375351358
9597. interviewing checking references training the	salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive-	and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory	performance was too high	3117.8434446956153
9598. it was his experience that only one good salesman	was found out of every seven hired- and only one was hired out	of every seven interviewed	4069.610829949333
9599. roleplaying was offered as a solution-	and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited	to a hotel conference room where the president explained the difficulty	he had and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who	just did not work out	4628.567564896086
9600. in place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires	checking their references interviewing them asking them to	be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them	4452.90588962395
9601. each person	was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples	789.4931784043376
9602. each salesman	was to read a sheet containing a description of the product	1184.4998158107232
9603. in	the testing room he was to make successively three presentations	to three different people	1088.1048657722765
9604. in the testing room three of the veteran	salesmen served as antagonists	969.3138779954086
9605. one handled the salesman in a	friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitating	manner	1882.9086276285282
9606. each was told to purchase material if he felt like it	750.1348039481032
9607. the	antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other	presentations	1419.0212724527387
9608. after each presentation the antagonist wrote his judgment	of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting of the	president three of his salesmen and a psychologist	4303.030318338784
9609. ten salesmen	were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon	789.2701997829374
9610. this procedure	was repeated one day a month for four months	755.7878511757897
9611. the batting average	of one success out of seven increased to one out of three	1089.0756802417645
9612. the president	of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped	one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred	per cent	3896.43180970588
9613. the reason for the value of this procedure was simply	that the applicants were tested at work in different situations	by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen	conducted themselves with different but typical restaurant owners	and managers	4514.87684335549
9614. they were in a sense tried out in realistic situations	563.3984332396936
9615. from the point of view of the applicants less time	was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal out of it as well	as some insights into their performances	3321.4008941252555
9616. another use of roleplaying	for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in	real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during	the daily course of work	4640.515737157507
9617. the position of receptionist was	opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other	girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher	prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions	4296.616640090212
9618. all applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist	758.0914410702296
9619. at the end of work one day the personnel man took the applicants	one at a time asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk	and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to	the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes	5126.317769842956
9620. each girl was independently tested by the personnel man and	he served not only as the director but as the antagonist and the observer	3725.848839738642
9621. somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom	he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat	mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did	the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing	wit sparkle and aplomb	5025.413444862083
9622. she was hired and was found to be entirely	satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day	2594.7182939629483
9623. in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area	since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision	but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen	in dynamic functioning	3942.177542880863
9624. some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying	for analysis may help explain the procedure	1872.0214182308114
9625. an engineer	had been made the works manager of a firm supplanting a retired employee	who had been considered outstandingly successful	2041.6981389684483
9626. the engineer had	more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was	considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for	his technical competence and was regarded as a comer	5772.186305645872
9627. however	he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position	784.5602932696529
9628. he seemed	to antagonize everyone	22.232430212281308
9629. turnover rates of personnel went up production	dropped and morale was visibly reduced	788.5066222836635
9630. despite the fact that he	was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor	administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him	4660.508456501272
9631. at	the insistence of his own supervisor- the president of the firm he	enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders	2031.019157539164
9632. he played	a number of typical situations before observers other supervisors who	kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought	was wrong	4444.996777866539
9633. entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in	criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an	extent	1878.5728689007615
9634. he did not really listen to others had little interest in their	ideas and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right	way	4104.6634585573165
9635. the entire group of managers explained in great detail a number	of human relations errors that he made	1562.6098533846284
9636. one by one these	errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors	2120.3209607391045
9637. he admitted his behavior and defended it	93.5089291310588
9638. he refused to change	his approach and instead he attacked high and low- the officials for	their not backing him and subordinates for their laxness stupidity	and stubbornness	4484.802869057201
9639. after the diagnosing he left the course convinced	that it could do him no good	1102.752111488227
9640. we may say that his problem	was diagnosed but that he refused treatment	1175.3556444966723
9641. the engineer turned works	manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it	1261.7108176006973
9642. we	may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success	had he learned some human relations skills; or we may say that	his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his	refusal to adjust to the opinions of others	7014.367950249734
9643. in any case he refused	to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made	over	1731.5888577240596
9644. another case may be given in illustration of a successful	use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive	analysis	3666.5087345729175
9645. in a course for supermarket operators a district manager	who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly	successful as a store manager found that in supervising other	managers he was having a difficult time	3940.692542911969
9646. on playing some typical situations	before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated	as unsatisfactory	2378.576948366769
9647. he was told he displayed for example a sense	of superiority- and he answered: well i am supposed to know	all the answers aren't i	2596.9185736868053
9648. he was criticized for his curtness	and abruptness- and he answered: i am not working to become	popular	2344.9603076875437
9649. on being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered:	i have to make decisions	937.010026771222
9650. in short	as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and	defends himself	1415.9211061128203
9651. however in this case the district manager was led	to see the errors of his ways	1246.3752818324763
9652. the necessary step between diagnosis and	training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms	1647.6365826967788
9653. how this	was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial	problem	942.0356126251654
9654. the director helped tailor-make a check list of the district	manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences	commenting on the mistakes they felt he made	4468.793069839223
9655. these errors were	then collected and written on a blackboard condensing similar ideas	794.0565457209551
9656. eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual	to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the	particular errors	4080.1432386907713
9657. they were asked to vote true if they thought	they had seen him make the error false if they thought he had	not; and cannot say if they were not certain	3333.1844428125414
9658. the manager	sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went	up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard	4119.158086210053
9659. no comments	were made during the voting	94.33403421573001
9660. the results looked as follows: f	65.67682294395854
9661. the first eight of these eighteen statements which received	at least one-half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis	checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager	roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared	4380.84522558808
9662. to prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself	only during the sessions they were rather lengthy	the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that	he would not know what to expect new antagonists were brought on the	scene unexpectedly and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately	behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in	a manner for which he had been previously criticized	0.30166232349522504
9663. after	every session the check marks were totaled up and graphed and in this	way the supervisor's progress was charted	1872.5298510449666
9664. in life	we learn to play our roles and we freeze into patterns which become	so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do	4276.7251468322365
9665. we can see	others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us	better than we see ourselves	2034.2857949572804
9666. to learn what we do is the first step	for improvement	759.5207560815046
9667. to accept the validity of the judgments of others is	the second step	789.6603744101127
9668. to want to change is the third step	252.5443876340069
9669. to practice new	procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the	fourth step	1100.4132485183463
9670. to use these new ways in daily life is the last step	961.3961794244012
9671. roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to	training	505.9356113785806
9672. when an evaluative situation is set up and no concern	is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that	roleplaying is used for evaluation	4467.109638765383
9673. observers can see a person engaged	in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion	1420.0127567970678
9674. this behavior is more veridical- or true than other	testing behavior for some types of evaluation and so can give quick and	accurate estimates of complex functioning	4289.651543497772
9675. while roleplaying	for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents	one of the major uses of this procedure	2323.2835044573794
9676. training	the objective of this chapter is to clarify	the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts	2370.153431981803
9677. in addition the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will	be reviewed	643.7164936536846
9678. the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated	rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this	unique training area	3702.504450247997
9679. the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying	application from the previous discussion of training are twofold:	spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new	2476.3716403017984
9680. it is not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient's	communicating an introject has appeared and is holding sway	3259.109673812351
9681. one	learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's	suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality	which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances parrotlike	3764.153380617866
9682. the	content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition as	if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so	simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom	common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over	from a parent until he experiences it as part of him	8448.83785106585
9683. one hebephrenic	woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow	phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite her wracking	sobs and streaming cheeks i felt only a cold annoyance with her	3745.804884627494
9684. eventually such incidents became more sporadic and more sharply demarcated	from her day-after-day behavior and in one particular session	after several minutes of such behavior- which as usual went on	without any accompanying words from her- she asked eagerly did	you see granny	6664.704139017847
9685. at first i did not know what she meant; i	thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from	seeing	her grandmother in their distant home-city	3327.426450254942
9686. then i realized that	she had been deliberately showing me this time what granny was like;	and when i replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch	4259.867066738243
9687. at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother-introject	began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she muttered	in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside	me! i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this;	but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room	from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory	tone your	father despises you! again i at first misconstrued	this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast	through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter	conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased	0.20124717349522497
9688. then i replied coldly if you despise me why don't you	say so directly	1414.9190832002414
9689. she looked confused at this and i felt sure	it had been a wrong response for me to make	1718.375688073997
9690. it then occurred to me to	ask is that what that woman told you	1397.7991384378274
9691. she clearly agreed	that this had been the case	260.80472930245753
9692. i realized now that she had been showing	me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her	mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of	the reasons why she hated that woman inside her	6988.540057809371
9693. what had been an unmanageably	powerful introject was now despite its continuing charge	of energy disconcerting to me sufficiently within control of her ego	that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like	4006.7648417594073
9694. earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety	of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would	sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in	the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice	7232.675085739216
9695. a somewhat	less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine who used to often seclude	herself in her room often sounded through the closed door- as i	would find on passing by between our sessions- for all the world	like two persons a scolding mother and a defensive child	4749.672668364873
9696. particularly	hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which	the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the	therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself	only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself	he finds distinctly unwelcome	7609.106557157347
9697. i have found time and again that	some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part	of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis; and only	when i can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of	my personality does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of	the patient's behavior	5467.328808363806
9698. for example one hebephrenic man used to	annoy me month after month by saying whenever i got up to leave and	made my fairly steoreotyped comment that i would be seeing him on the	following day or whenever you're welcome in a notably condescending	fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank him	for the privilege of spending the hour with him and he were thus pointing	up my failure to utter a humbly grateful thank you to him	at the end of each session	0.30166232349522504
9699. eventually it became clear to me partly	with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my	condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his	condescending	you're welcome was very accurately personifying	an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own	demeanor over these months on each of these occasions when i had	bid him good-bye with the consoling note each time that the healing	christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered	again on the morrow	0.20124717349522497
9700. another patient a paranoid woman for many	months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow	patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building	as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met	6782.031348094686
9701. this behavior on her part subsided only after i had come to see the	uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand her arranging	the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking or turning	the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others	and on the other hand my own coming stolidly into her room despite	her persistent and vociferous objections bringing my big easy chair	with me usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred	to keep in a very cold state and plunking myself down in my chair-	in short behaving as if i owned her room	0.20124717349522497
9702. here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced	in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming	verbal or nonverbal statement	3475.198241892233
9703. one finds for example	that a terse and stereotyped	verbal expression seeming at first to be	a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy	as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and	the most unconventional of meanings	4551.246940888996
9704. more than anything it is the	therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype	which helps these meanings to become revealed something like a spread-out	deck of cards on sporadic occasions over the passage of the	patient's and his months of work together	6921.152766621961
9705. one cannot assume of course	that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype	at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when	the stereotype was uttered; probably it is correct to think of it as	a matter of a well-grooved stereotyped mode of expression- and no	or but a few other communicational grooves as yet- being there	available for the patient's use as newly-emerging emotions and	ideas well up in him over the course of months	0.20124717349522497
9706. but it is true that the	therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are	at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel	of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from	one another	6669.230167330863
9707. sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a	how are you now	643.6361955630626
9708. or an i want to go home or whatever-	but a nonverbal one which reveals itself gradually as the condensed	expression of more than one latent meaning	4308.651584487539
9709. a hebephrenic man used	to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his	largely-silent	hours with his therapist	2307.513850837598
9710. when the therapist came to feel	on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him what is that	bill- hello or farewell	3259.70306231515
9711. the patient replied both dearie-	two in one	168.16942689417067
9712. of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression	that which seems best to give release and communicational expression	to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter	3876.0100099662695
9713. it is	no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated	of all schizophrenic patients shows as one of his characteristic	symptoms laughter- laughter which now makes one feel scorned	or hated which now makes one feel like weeping or which now gives	one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and	which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which	could in no way be	conveyed by any number of words words which are so	unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another	0.20124717349522497
9714. to	a much less full extent the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus	has a comparable communicative function; in working with these patients	the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling	over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus	not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze	but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute	forms of communication in which from time to time quite different	things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently	aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them	in words	0.30166232349522504
9715. as i have been intimating in the schizophrenic-	and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question	which i have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which	one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas	which are at an unconscious level well sorted out but rather a condensed	expression of feelings and ideas which even in the unconscious	have yet to become well differentiated from one another	0.20124717349522497
9716. freeman	cameron and mcghie in their description of the disturbances of thinking	found in chronic schizophrenic patients say in regard to condensation	that h the lack of adequate discrimination between the	self and the environment and the objects contained therein h in itself	is the prototypical condensation	7153.455494403131
9717. in my experience a	great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are	so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated	from figurative meanings in his subjective experience	3432.7691283984705
9718. thus he may	be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment	by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental	events on the global scene	4271.181622366335
9719. recently for example a paranoid woman's	large-scale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive	curiosity which has become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic	of mid-twentieth-century human culture developed itself before the	end of the session into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peeking	at her partially exposed breast as indeed i was	5138.891078708997
9720. or equally	often a concretistic-seeming particularistic-seeming statement may consist	with its mundane exterior in a form of poetry- may be full	of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression:	a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speaking	6797.17850315582
9721. of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often	than not entirely unaware	935.6027043759893
9722. his subjective experience may be a remarkably	concretistic one	394.11479992449586
9723. one hebephrenic women confided to me i	live in a world of words as if to her words were fully concrete	objects; burnham in his excellent article concerning schizophrenic	communication includes mention of similar clinical material	3853.4617639220987
9724. a borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various	theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate	fashion during session after session with me were like great	cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him; as he	spoke i was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high	in the air from a docked steamship	0.30166232349522504
9725. the many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary	information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's	contents around prefixes stems suffixes etc	2596.4508348215973
9726. a significant	reduction	in the voume of store information is thus realized especially	for a highly inflected language such as russian	3059.8576024626386
9727. for english the reduction	in size is less striking	260.3244571033444
9728. this approach requires that:	each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence	between the occurrence and dictionary entries and the information	retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized	into a description of the particular word	6480.973050941654
9729. the logical scheme used	to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in	the dictionary file	1419.820219986141
9730. implementation of the latter requires storage of	information needed only for synthesis	962.869335626941
9731. we suggest the application	of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem	951.0661664114426
9732. but first we must define two terms so that their meaning will be	clearly understood:  form- any unique sequence of alphabetic	characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed	by a space	5472.159407869699
9733. occurrence- an instance of a form in text	167.71273641148434
9734. we propose a method for selecting only dictionary information	required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information	directly to the occurrences in text	4496.418103252118
9735. we accomplish this by compiling	a list of text forms as text is read by the computer	1415.8746320827086
9736. a random-storage	scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical	way to compile this text-form list	2340.2406921309184
9737. dictionary forms found to match	forms in the text list are marked	642.0022636040119
9738. a location in the computer store	is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the	form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences	of the form in text	5352.357862236922
9739. finally information is retrieved from the dictionary	as required by stages of the translation process- the grammatic	description for sentence-structure determination equivalent-choice	information for semantic analysis and target-language equivalents	for output construction	3457.030512502342
9740. the dictionary is a form dictionary	at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching	text occurrences with dictionary entries	4117.736550252643
9741. also the dictionary	is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and	the file of information that pertains to these forms	2601.911245628816
9742. a more detailed	description of dictionary operations- text lookup and dictionary	modification- give a clearer picture	1893.1850604958406
9743. text lookup as we will	describe it consists of three steps	498.3878330319038
9744. the first is compiling a list	of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text	occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each	occurrence	4832.643765948278
9745. for this step the computer memory is separated into three	regions: cells in the w-region are used for storage of the forms	in the text-form list; cells in the x-region and y region	are reserved as information cells for text forms	4306.842612073572
9746. when an occurrence	f is isolated during text reading a random memory address f	the address of a cell in the x-region is computed from the form	of f	4658.3216246969605
9747. let f denote the form of f	93.91508357040652
9748. if cell f has not previously	been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form	list it is now assigned as the information cell of f	4664.076824864723
9749. the form itself	is stored in the next available cells of the w-region beginning	in cell f	1414.1729963551918
9750. the address f and the number of cells required to	store the form are written in f; the information cell f is saved	to represent the text occurrence	4469.376731303301
9751. text reading continues with the next	occurrence	94.08361397932448
9752. let us assume that f is identical to the form	of an occurrence f which preceded f in the text	2816.530134056708
9753. when this situation	exists the address f will equal f which was produced from f	1097.01856587142
9754. if f was assigned as the information cell for f the routine can	detect that f is identical to f by comparing f with the form	stored at location f	4831.350112657419
9755. the address f is stored in the cell f	261.7521031119119
9756. when	as in this case the two forms match the address f is saved to	represent the occurrence f	2582.554624966487
9757. text reading continues with the next	occurrence	94.08361397932448
9758. a third situation is possible	22.31359518685028
9759. the formula for computing	random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a	distinct address for each distinct form	2191.525551189735
9760. thus when more than one distinct	form leads to a particular cell in the x-region a chain of	information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell	in the chain for each form	5632.084808754846
9761. if f leads to an address f that is equal	to the address computed from f even though f does not match f	the chain of information cells is extended from f by storing the	address of the next available cell in the y-region f in f	4748.922626341557
9762. the	cell f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned	as the information cell of f	2809.1487637010096
9763. a third cell can be added by storing	the address of another y-cell in f; similarly as many cells	are added as are required	2467.8424683466064
9764. each information cell in the chain contains	the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assigned	is stored	3277.781771083906
9765. each cell except the last in the chain also contains	the address of the y-cell that is the next element of the chain;	the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the	chain	4107.31022608628
9766. hence when the address f is computed from f the cell f	and	all y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether	f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form	list and the chain	6809.638286563662
9767. when the information cell for f has been determined	it is saved as a representation of f	1412.4299156741604
9768. text reading continues	with the next occurrence	141.0279762090883
9769. text reading is terminated when	a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list	1412.5917885318065
9770. this initiates the second step of glossary lookup- connecting the	information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms	3027.1354791617405
9771. each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form	list	792.9603787851564
9772. each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information	cell of the matching text form is saved	2609.8931325052804
9773. the number of dictionary	forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved	949.7715855278508
9774. these two pieces	of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text	form constitute the table of dictionary usage	3282.8036441007594
9775. if each text form is	marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained	in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have	been read	3237.888666687876
9776. the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken	at that time	1175.0705965629877
9777. each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form	list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in	the form list during text reading	3124.0088773135967
9778. a random address f that lies within	the x-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the	i-th dictionary form	2828.113605468066
9779. if cell f is an information cell it and	any information cells in the y-region that have been linked to f	each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching	form is stored	3764.8964745893268
9780. the dictionary form is compared with each of these	text forms	753.2114374132508
9781. when a match is found an entry is made in the table of	dictionary usage	1102.0981008802091
9782. if cell f is not an information cell we conclude	that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list	3051.028682245288
9783. these	two steps essentially complete the lookup operation	167.79486125312107
9784. the final step	merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information	that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list and	uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach	the appropriate information to each occurrence in text	7040.271970399981
9785. the list of	text forms in the w-region of memory and the contents of the information	cells in the x and y-regions are no longer required	2731.4796646596988
9786. only	the assignment of the information cells is important	391.79351340378884
9787. the	first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis	of the input text	1102.0536598054973
9788. the grammatical description of each occurrence in	the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis	2827.8715484096024
9789. a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any	type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached	to each text occurrence	2733.1388330726286
9790. the grammatic descriptions of all forms	in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary	file	2589.516221436465
9791. the order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe	637.5575452425967
9792. when entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary	usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store	in the computer	4074.386055392036
9793. this selection-rejection process takes place as the	file is read	377.61564756402356
9794. each entry that is selected for storage is written into	the next available cells of the w-region	2132.5851507773177
9795. the address of the	first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information	cell for the form	2035.0777099231207
9796. when the complete file has been	read the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary	have been stored in the w-region; the information cell assigned	to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description	of the form it represents	6817.818832709997
9797. hence the description of each text	occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell	addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information	cell for each occurrence	3222.2363426317793
9798. the only requirements on	dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each	form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form	list and that information for each form be available in a sequence	identical with the sequence of the forms	6913.326438698937
9799. this leaves the ordering	of entries variable	93.57800766602864
9800. two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary	are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms	rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more	than one dictionary form	5489.580868388514
9801. the former is intended to decrease the amount	of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage	1102.8337046219822
9802. the latter is useful	for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence	reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents	3698.1394229388998
9803. applying	the techniques developed at harvard for generating a paradigm from	a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of	a word to the dictionary at once	3230.1411623327867
9804. an extension of the principle would	permit entering a grammatic description of each form	1419.7601816794584
9805. equivalents could	be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the	dictionary or after the word has been studied in context	2744.804789263103
9806. thus one can	think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form	1660.7069070687776
9807. if	all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary	a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible	2316.936384328983
9808. for example the inflected forms of a word can be represented	insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to	be attached	4282.155647132169
9809. the full forms can be derived from such information	just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list	2033.9837010378571
9810. similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the	equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they	apply	to each form	4661.54031911074
9811. the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon	such summarization or designed around it	1097.3911862390382
9812. when irregularity and variation	prevent summarizing information is written in complete detail	958.1561173248263
9813. entries	are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information	retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary	operations is decreased	2871.593605320515
9814. in sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations	of influences that can only be suggested here	2351.2137955442204
9815. the tendency is toward	putting dominant stress at the end	374.3489388444225
9816. there is a parallel to this tendency	in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes	1872.0876248245
9817. thus the	first lines of one of charles wesley's hymns are as follows	789.8238530663663
9818. a charge to keep i have a god to glorify	561.0814717216444
9819. in the	tune to which this hymn is most often sung boylston the syllables	have and fy ending their lines have twice the time any	other syllables have	2980.0324859400216
9820. dominant stress is of course more than extended	duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress	or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of	were spoken alone: a dominant stress given to glorify would normally	center on its first syllable rather than its last	7628.035591625814
9821. but the parallel	is significant	14.831639804871614
9822. when the answer to what's wrong now	140.72665284585116
9823. is bill's	broken a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement	a chair	1098.5985725944715
9824. from the point of view of syntactic analysis the	head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from	the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers	in the breaking; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken	only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence	7698.476597988338
9825. in i know one	thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing;	in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know	2990.5407320045288
9826. in small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will	generally be on the complement very friendly; in the double sentence	the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally	be on the subjects the town and the people	6348.9774090231185
9827. in what's	a linguist	2.9730204726025073
9828. dominant stress will generally be on the subject	a linguist; in who's a linguist	1429.5317811736102
9829. it will generally be on	the complement a linguist	263.0360410087796
9830. dominant stress is on her luggage	both in that's her luggage where her luggage is the complement	and in there's her luggage where it is the subject	4294.590629629833
9831. adverbial	second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress	when they terminate sentences	1090.7358215984575
9832. if the answer to what was that noise	248.06667914973508
9833. is george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily	be on the first complement the cat not the second complement	out	2166.8146949571938
9834. final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress	391.553897107868
9835. if the	answer to what was that noise	165.49205561635634
9836. is george reads the news emotionally	dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally	2121.4891486479873
9837. when prepositional complements are divided as in what are you	looking for	642.1767460905819
9838. they are likely to lose dominant stress	140.9519051761399
9839. context	is of extreme importance	14.772820517422275
9840. what is new in the context is likely	to be made more prominent than what is not	2122.012240316597
9841. thus in a context in which	there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is	new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows	here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local	weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows	5297.045854171669
9842. the personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed	because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context	2821.711907502926
9843. in i'll go with george dominant stress is probably on george;	but if george has just been mentioned prominently	what is said is probably	i'll go with him and dominant stress is probably on the preposition	with	3967.8988748200163
9844. when a gesture accompanies who's he	65.90775865517563
9845. the personal	pronoun has dominant stress because he has not been mentioned	previously	790.9687469125104
9846. if both george and a piece of information george	does not have are prominent in the context but the idea of telling george	is new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why	not tell george	6037.5717984580315
9847. but when what is new in a particular context	is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress	at all	2479.4747302647474
9848. thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets	its significance from its use with snows: nothing can snow snow	but it	3473.7080726336635
9849. in there aren't many young people in the neighborhood	the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head	people: the fact that the young creatures of interest are people	seems rather obvious	3559.991303873286
9850. if women replaced people it would normally	have dominant stress	562.4980520367819
9851. in i have things to do the word things	makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress	than do	2043.8814179687877
9852. if work is substituted for things	it will have dominant stress	749.3165152963695
9853. in i	know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than	to semantically pale thing	1734.9180492978182
9854. in i knew you when you were a child	and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that	the young woman spoken to is still pretty	4478.723074085994
9855. dominant stress on pretty	would be almost insulting here	262.19536087003473
9856. in the written language then	can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here but much	of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness	and a careless reader will have to back up and reread	6328.343382412383
9857. often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion	501.8738527926369
9858. thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress	is likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong	stress also	3672.9397942041423
9859. in she has it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily	be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to	center	2312.680328973575
9860. in we're painting at our garage strong stress on at	indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an	effort at painting	4092.960839996963
9861. where there is comparison or contrast dominant	stresses normally operate to center attention	792.7341498611084
9862. thus in his friends	are stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal for his	and sisters' but in his friends are stranger than his sisters	strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters	5522.699490051546
9863. in	he's hurting himself more than he's hurting you both himself	and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if	there were no contrast	2734.532348867022
9864. in is she chinese or japanese	65.9313046386311
9865. the	desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last	components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns	of stress of chinese and japanese	3223.7621165545997
9866. sometimes strong stress	serves to focus an important secondary relationship	559.141484636292
9867. thus in mary	wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks	mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip	strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series	of actions of mary's concerned with an account of her trip	and strong stress	on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about	which mary wrote accounts	0.20124717349522497
9868. in hunger stimulates man too the situation	is very similar	561.9800472993527
9869. strong stress on hunger treats hunger as	an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation	as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats	man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger	4115.068948974855
9870. here again in the written language it is possible to help the	reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much	of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light	of context	6191.74627961505
9871. when a word represents a larger construction of	which it is the only expressed part it normally has more stress than	it would have in fully expressed construction	2996.9307266913465
9872. thus when yes i	have is the response to have you finished reading the paper	1656.9910885009845
9873. the stress on have which here represents have finished reading	the paper is quite strong	1103.2740658725854
9874. in mack's the leader at camp but	jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents	is the leader and therefore has stress	3914.445758371384
9875. mack's the leader at	camp but jack's here with this is deprived of stress makes	here the complement in the clause	2032.9397972371146
9876. in of all the suggestions that	were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents	his suggestion and is stressed	3040.0118902336458
9877. when go represents itself and	a complement in which	boat did jack go on	941.5524435476358
9878. it has strong stress; when it represents	only itself and on which is its complement	on has stronger stress	than go does	3278.7259823783584
9879. omission of a subordinator pronoun however does	not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which	the subordinator pronoun would be object	2729.1182686626057
9880. thus to has light stress	both in that was the conclusion that i came to and in that	was the conclusion i came to	3679.0076759993754
9881. but when to represents to consciousness	in that was the moment that i came to and similarly	in that was the moment i came to there is much stronger stress	on to	3427.218512202527
9882. in i wanted to tell him but i was afraid to the final	to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him	3476.1862062878217
9883. in	to tell him of course to is normally unstressed	375.32282981231225
9884. when i	have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i	have instructions that i am to leave this place dominant stress	is ordinarily on leave	4247.399169984556
9885. when the same sequence is equivalent in	meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave dominant stress	is ordinarily on instructions	2309.409608772322
9886. it is clear that patterns	of stress sometimes	show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where	without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written	4460.272888437147
9887. i'll come by tuesday	2.9622146216296623
9888. i	can't be happy long without drinking water	249.29122937251896
9889. in the first of these	sentences if by is the complement of come and tuesday is	an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong	stress on by in the spoken language; but if a complement for	come is implied and by tuesday is a prepositional unit used as	an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most	5682.390519244174
9890. in	the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and	without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless	i drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on	drinking; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water	and without drinking water is equivalent to without water	for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on	water	8577.589136776953
9891. but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example	can undermine distinctions such as these	1420.3494942263626
9892. and patterns of stress	are not always unambiguous by any means	747.9081377783564
9893. in the steiners have	busy	lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting	relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives	or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked	up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings	of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically	a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed	by its object in the second	0.20124717349522497
9894. syllables are	linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but as	has been noted are consonantal under certain circumstances and which	may or may not be combined with preceding andor following consonants	or combinations of consonants	6058.113575108772
9895. syllables are genuine units but division	of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties	1105.9563583307004
9896. sometimes	even the number of syllables is not clear	389.1353759278013
9897. doubt on this point	is strongest before l and  or r	503.9704014423729
9898. from the point of view	of	word formation real might be expected to have two syllables	1875.8490592327325
9899. historically	re is the formative that is employed also in republic	and al is the common suffix	1410.8511138586769
9900. when ity is added	real clearly has two syllables	393.82324024277426
9901. but there is every reason to regard	deal as a monosyllable and because of the fact that l commonly	has the quality of  when it follows vowel sounds deal seems	to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real	4040.874938860946
9902. it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less	successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels	3245.138173206399
9903. no single explanation is adequate to account for this	260.4521780287625
9904. improvement	however is urgent and at least three things will be needed	964.7889977913012
9905. the first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses	374.42783774340467
9906. even	beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable	variety of consonant systems both in their general outlines and in	many specific details	3902.7454743686276
9907. an advanced student has read a considerable	number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more	unusual types	1869.5247632513704
9908. by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know	no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple	distinction between register and contour languages	4085.490099777902
9909. this limited	familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work	with tone	794.7887664088355
9910. tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory	until a more representative selection of systems is familar to	every practicing field linguist	3488.8820051178236
9911. papers like these four if widely read	will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work	1257.7556880439731
9912. the second need is better field techniques	141.9964566348337
9913. the great majority	of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping	types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed those who	are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who	are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in	those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed	with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole	matter	0.20124717349522497
9914. the result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial	treatment	564.5811907275386
9915. as these maladies overlap so must the cure	168.10170361235146
9916. analyses such	as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone	is impossible and that it is simple	2594.59836103308
9917. they will give suggestions that	can be worked up into field procedures	639.134766009017
9918. good field techniques will not	only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative	attitudes	2364.1426304038546
9919. actually none of these papers says much directly about	field techniques	504.92350466067927
9920. but it is worth pondering that very little has	been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics	2584.9047494183305
9921. these	things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake	of extensive publication of analytic results	1717.9622816536764
9922. the third need	is for better theory	141.52759978483826
9923. we should expect that general phonologic theory	should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels but it has	not been	2328.4331945033227
9924. this can only be for one of two reasons: either the two	are quite different and will require totally different theory	or our existing theories are insufficiently general	4496.132478694801
9925. if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development	of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically	in better theory for all phonologic subsystems	3452.937782928373
9926. one issue	that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different	phonologic subsystems	1869.8374099382079
9927. since tone systems typically comprise fewer	units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they	would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis	2859.6122595008296
9928. actual practice	does not often work out this way	389.5392098314161
9929. tone systems are certainly more complex	than the number of units would suggest and often analytically	more difficult than much larger consonantal systems	2305.495423499792
9930. welmers has	suggested one explanation	22.508108818472785
9931. tone languages use for linguistic contrasts	speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use	1092.9377954521105
9932. this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion	for the more knowledgeable	1886.491400351132
9933. the problem is to disentangle the	linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic	features	1100.48793500822
9934. of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of	the phonology: consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and	an individual component	3684.2774575275334
9935. but in general the individual variation is	a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude	1580.2527790735999
9936. with tone individual differences may be greater than the linguistic	contrasts which are superimposed on them	1882.3184361370543
9937. pitch differences from	one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far	exceed the small differences between tones	2181.0443651807955
9938. however any such suggestion	accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in	developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic	difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded	5815.888540617949
9939. a second explanation is suggested by the material described in rowlands'	paper	642.4336159456313
9940. tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed	139.47381043608206
9941. neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate	the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the	other	2482.676685145386
9942. other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap	in this way; for example duration sometimes figures in both the	vowel system and the intonation	3912.2822945744424
9943. some phonetic features for example	glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics	and sometimes to accentual systems	2177.5222682381177
9944. but no other two phonologic	systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in	some languages	2593.213303722367
9945. this explanation of tone difficulties however does	not apply in all languages	640.5517889587378
9946. in some	interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation	spans	1650.7375763494213
9947. in many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored	and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation	2459.80999479524
9948. still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as	simple as one might expect	1886.270471955321
9949. a third explanation is suggested	by richardson's analysis of sukuma tone	497.3846643733938
9950. there we see a basically	simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic	system	2115.1692880510986
9951. while the phonemes can be very easily stated no one	is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences	can be related in some way to morphemic units ie until the morphophonemics	is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable	to expect success	4881.328351984071
9952. in the typical tone language	tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal	morphophonemics	2122.4407389723324
9953. the phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic	systems however are very different	789.0716718119154
9954. the inventory of tones	is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single	dimension pitch level	2366.1321543109966
9955. consonantal systems are not merely larger they	are multidimensional	260.2062854229522
9956. morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining	certain points in the system	1180.6063183738634
9957. the possibilities in the consonantal	system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually	used	1729.9377893356655
9958. phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show	a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions	of contrast in the system	3888.7727104531027
9959. tonal morphophonemics in a common	case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone	1262.708167726434
9960. the possibilities	are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater	1400.1786306993042
9961. often therefore there are a number of rules having the same	effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite	effect	2457.5838456576116
9962. tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning	analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number	of rules is no greater	3482.677103972945
9963. the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem	in the phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller systems	are more troublesome- for any given degree of morphophonemic	complexity	3095.602474402639
9964. this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties	of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are	often more puzzling than consonantal systems	4633.425229200952
9965. the statement of the system	is a different matter	262.75117848735874
9966. smaller systems can of course be stated	much more succinctly	561.9808521545946
9967. a phonemic system can be stated without reference	to morphophonemics but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics	1566.8034269763534
9968. and the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation	to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed	without close attention to the morphophonemics- at least the less	satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through	morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures	7496.833630960947
9969. the design of orthographies has received much less attention from	linguists than the problem deserves	1099.3816689534299
9970. there has been a tendency on the	part of many american linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription	will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only	real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance	6336.114609063459
9971. most others have been content to give only the most	general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology	when designing orthographies	2598.1004420841646
9972. apparently the feeling is that	anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible	pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs	3883.049084481354
9973. the result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography	conferences by such considerations as typographic 'esthetics'	which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices	carried over from european languages	3758.6509219468526
9974. many of the suggested systems	seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures	that they purport to represent	3231.8399404886977
9975. linguists have not always been	more enlightened than practical people and sometimes have insisted	on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater	significance	2588.7761198383614
9976. as a result many people have been confirmed in their	conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts	can contribute anything but confusion	4078.8010298062472
9977. a e sharp	in vowel-length and syllabicity in kikuyu examines one set of related	orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail	2180.512631605129
9978. his	objective is merely to determine what distinctions of length and	syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography		2350.440721505188
9979. to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant	parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail	1731.3051282086285
9980. in the process he	develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort	that are often difficult	2360.060014106452
9981. a few of his examples are of very great interest	and the whole discussion of some importance for theory	1737.4708722674045
9982. his orthographic	recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on	the one hand or of superficiality on the other	2604.424315496101
9983. rather he weighs each	phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness	786.9974093053609
9984. he concludes	that some changes can made in the current orthography which will	appreciably improve its usefulness but hesitates to suggest precise	graphic devices to effect these changes	4475.630673012035
9985. i hope his suggestions are	given the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circles	788.8466586971988
9986. this however	will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly	indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography	design	3258.833515198508
9987. we need many more studies of this sort if the design	of written languages is to be put on a sound basis	2184.55027613145
9988. one other	paper deals with a phonologic problem: vowel harmony in igbo by	j carnochan	1649.8789375891101
9989. this restates the already widely known facts in terms	of prosodies	499.289914665845
9990. as a restatement it makes only a small contribution	to knowledge of igbo	1182.2536301577225
9991. but it would seem more intended as a tract advocating	the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems	of igbo phonology	2480.443963887384
9992. the paper has a certain value as a comparatively	easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats	a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible	to compare it with a more traditional statement	5803.83973459545
9993. it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously	described	942.1176764991527
9994. but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could	not be treated by traditional methods	2104.5797802895577
9995. it seems to me that it rather	easily can	258.6779705629075
9996. five of the papers deal with grammatical problems	251.48451055198672
9997. on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they	are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider	variety of subject matter	2967.4987583641387
9998. my comments must be briefer than the papers	deserve	391.9423300164912
9999. w h whiteley writes on the verbal radical	in iraqw	375.28395120746666
10000. this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement	to his early a short description of item-categories in iraqw	2583.2455056751096
