SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much	the same criticisms	1098.9071865407436
2. the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed	and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems	never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point	4683.779672936835
3. there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact	that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in	diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from proto-yokuts	3333.68086370616
4. this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier;	or again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much	larger territory; or both	3734.0214200112305
5. the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by	the fact that athabascan shows 3	1423.2653905864636
6. 46 stems per meaning slot as against	2	251.24448005044565
7. 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented	in our sample: 24 as against 21	1571.2023120683214
8. 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3	65.03177659482152
9. 75 in equivalent number	these general facts are mentioned to make clear	that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant	comparison	2724.3694835360593
10. the greatest difference in the two sets of figures	is due to differences in the two sets of lists used	2816.081141029038
11. these differences	in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabularies were	built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning	between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform	territorial area but that hoijer's vocabulary is based on swadesh's	second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating	all items which might be culturally or geographically determined	5570.1636402160375
12. swadesh	in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal;	i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley	3675.1575647869213
13. the	result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4;	and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4	2171.78014022342
14. swadesh and therefore	hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even	genera; their	classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or	recurrent parts	4650.255384924947
15. the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as	in size	788.0891131335604
16. other classes are included only by myself	or only by swadesh and hoijer	1187.7885298205797
17. what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes:	body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly	even representation come out with	nearly even ratios; 2	2995.1881627541006
18. 7; nature	ratios 3	4.428017647379427
19. 1; ratios 3	0.20041515
20. 7; ratios 4	0.30041514999999996
21. 4	0.20041515
22. it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios	come out somewhat higher	except for verbs where alone the athabascan	ratio is lower	4301.196024287849
23. this exception may be connected with hoijer's	use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total	list as against 3	2306.614311586749
24. or the exception may be due to a particular	durability peculiar to the athabascan verb	1654.516301610637
25. more word class ratios	determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the	question	1094.7418009845671
26. if word classes differ in their resistance or liability	to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that	individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually	4293.313787467623
27. hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings	allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large		750.2515896818419
28. for yokuts	i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as they were expressed	by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems	3902.2145391679937
29. the totals for these	five categories are not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively	1418.0711786571644
30. for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two	of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems; the three	others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively f;	f; and f stems	6047.950683930133
31. while the particular limits of these groupings	may	seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding	grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five	classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers	of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan	4747.363888673963
32. when now	we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing	in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or	two or three or four we find these differences: f   this distribution	can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart:	f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1	8373.867272012658
33. if	the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families	the distance would of course be 0	2039.493488663949
34. if it were wholly random	and unrelated it would be 2	754.3856119459027
35. 0 assuming the five classes were equal in	n which approximately they are	780.2373377637477
36. the actual mean of 1	22.184878700196215
37. 07 being	about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2	501.7122781546829
38. 0 of no correlation	it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity	in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning	as regards long-term stem displacement	5000.169205091839
39. in 1960 david d	thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer languages	which compares 8 mon-khmer languages	with the i-e language data on which swadesh based the revised	retention	rate and his revised 100 word	basic	glottochronological list in towards greater accuracy h		3558.1127955687166
40. thomas' findings are first that the individual	items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence;	but second that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying	in their average persistence	first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas	mine was partially positive	6542.708513063906
41. his second	conclusion	on semantic word classes agrees with mine	375.5107728803965
42. this second conclusion	independently arrived at by independent study of material from two	pairs of language families as different and remote from one another	as these four are cannot be ignored	5014.887994412742
43. thomas also presents a	simple equation for deriving an index of persistence which weights not	only the number of stems per meaning but their relative	frequency	2719.627540140995
44. thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per	meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages 100%; stem frequencies	7 and 1 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4 64%; stem frequencies	4 3 and 1 57%	5754.162582435419
45. his formula will have to be weighed may be	altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of	material	2172.356150964727
46. but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning	seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations	with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and gleason	presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area	6202.071708956299
47. as to relative frequencies of competing roots	thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered	the significance this might have	2451.624648763043
48. the problem needs further	exploration	22.34590807410121
49. i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full	yokuts presentation that awaits publication in which in listing 'two-stem	meanings' i set off by asterisks those forms in which	n of stem b was f of stem a3 the unasterisked ones	standing for f; or under 'four stems' i set off by asterisks	cases where the combined n of stems f was f	5725.224474388794
50. these	findings and others which will in time be developed will affect	the method of glottochronological inquiry	2117.617716280029
51. if adjectival meanings show	relatively low retentiveness of stems as i am confident will prove	to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic	lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms but only 8 per cent	of animals and plants which replace much more slowly	5081.076019891096
52. had hoijer	substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items	his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan	language separation smaller	5006.306967244878
53. and irrespective of the outcome	in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more	concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable	units	than with variously unstable ones	3347.6766750463125
54. it is evident that swadesh	has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages	but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior	of lexical items	5003.038265436447
55. why then this urge to include unstable items	in his basic list	640.4931603693987
56. it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical	and cultural conditioning as possible	2131.914410780844
57. and why that insistence	2.970460514090278
58. it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence	1179.4276972766932
59. but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is	a snare	793.765377343632
60. not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer	it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be	linguistically	3474.5679711665225
61. its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they	will fit actual languages more and more badly	1729.5764712893645
62. the practical operational	problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic	list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms	of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison	5487.5636936306455
63. the most important	quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as	possible	1254.4617256977315
64. in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely	on their being insulated and distinctive	1875.9232364143177
65. an elephant or a fox or a swan	or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality	of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye	or tooth or nail	3691.1839449112267
66. they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously	from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be	given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these	qualities	5352.074165096168
67. with the universal list as his weapon swadesh	has	extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight	ten twelve millennia back	2614.6510175099324
68. and he has proclaimed greater or less	affiliation between all western hemisphere languages	1173.1771922203322
69. some of this	may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic	ramification or by diffusion and coalescence	2181.9577409307076
70. but the farther out he	moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger	the speculative component in his inferences	3690.4860276898044
71. he has traversed provinces	and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor	does he control them	1719.0409604680458
72. he has announced results on hokan penutian	uto-aztecan and almost all other american families and phyla and	has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked	out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of	even a single family other than salish	6692.787696107145
73. the	remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope	stimulus potential and imagination	1247.6100250972017
74. but there is also a firm aspect	to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization	of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more	remote and elusive external links; of classification first with elapsed	age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of	what happened in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last	few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have	happened between them	0.30166232349522504
75. this involves step-by-step progress and such	will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing	body of scientific inquiry	2183.548729625047
76. if of the founders of glottochronology	swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and lees has repudiated his	own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve	4822.022960828453
77. there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's	rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown	so vast	2456.8642287665884
78. it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures	for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis	3071.4136515702994
79. i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a	universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally	inadequate in proportion as it is achieved	2595.5158544909164
80. i would propose	next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists	items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible	4115.140098132906
81. there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme	of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable	2031.5284833832568
82. an attempted	middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary	from which every fiftieth word was selected	2839.97355621495
83. doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should	arise about the methods for applying these policies	1421.0529285649832
84. it was nevertheless	almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a	complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to	use the germans against their former allies and with nazi-minded germans	expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the	other	7437.389644962845
85. when the yalta conference	opened the american policy of postponing all discussion of russia's	western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down	2316.9219921421945
86. starting	in great force late in december from a line stretching from	east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles	across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper	danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies	had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine	8132.010743501615
87. the long	delay in opening the second front was now working to russia's advantage	939.763360335582
88. the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line	which was substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between	russia and poland	3690.8755648565566
89. when this proposal was made stalin spoke	with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference	1566.996819374625
90. he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject	751.5445287594961
91. the bitter	memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace conference	and of the west's effort to stamp out bolshevism at its birth boiled	up within him	2854.8430856948016
92. you would drive us into shame he declared	250.66978709653728
93. the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov	were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau	2315.071189845591
94. yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted	the curzon line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be	digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland	in some regions	5635.758878955043
95. he did not mind the line itself which churchill	declared in the house of commons on february 27 1945 he had	always believed to be just and right but he did not want it called	by a hated name	4127.759566368398
96. the west had long since forgotten the events	of 1919 but it was not so easy for the red leaders who felt that they	had suffered great injustice in that period	4961.54929231775
97. in the dunn-atherton	memorandum of february 4 1942 the state department had expected	to be able to hold russia in check by withholding agreement to	her 1941 boundaries	2976.2614526124808
98. now stalin made it clear that he meant to move	poland's western borders deep into germany back to the western	neisse-oder river lines taking not only east prussia and all of	silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and including	stettin	6796.38663390749
99. from six to nine million additional germans would be	evicted though most would have fled and poland would receive far more	from germany than the poor territories including the great pripet	marshes which she lost to russia	3947.663049753313
100. stalin declared that he preferred	to continue the war a little longer although it costs us blood	in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense	of the germans	5154.831852449073
101. by this time churchill was not so cordial toward	moving poland westward as he had been at teheran where he and	eden had both heartily approved the idea	2998.399639204927
102. after a prolonged study	of the oder line on a map at teheran churchill liked the	picture	2126.786120738057
103. he would tell the poles he said that they had been given	a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way	2591.8390176144158
104. at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would	have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected	to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead	of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder	7037.610889340666
105. the	issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference	501.3736974812724
106. however	there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong	poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large	minorities of germans or russians	4475.596861049979
107. the moving of millions of the	german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room	for the polish slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate	was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it	was historically justified	4524.421195814642
108. of more importance to	the west than poland's boundaries was the character of her government	1654.3429204554727
109. at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could	be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet armies	2173.1694255609536
110. though	little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of	it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that	at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this	area and western capitalism preserved within it	6862.050795127747
111. believing devoutly	as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both	roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them	2161.6108625475676
112. the	issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported	in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin	government formed behind the red army	4825.65647384795
113. more time was spent in	trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at	yalta	1410.773723474262
114. the result was an agreement that the lublin government should	be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion	of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the poles abroad	and pledged to hold free and unfettered elections as soon as possible	on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot	7633.642030813874
115. all	democratic and anti-nazi parties were to have the right to campaign	637.9611433436844
116. roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this	issue	752.0404684382147
117. it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had	declared war in behalf of poland	1411.7040891991883
118. to stalin it was a matter of	life and death	562.4597976364361
119. he made this completely clear	14.907423777942103
120. speaking with great	earnestness he said: for the russian people the question	of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security	4283.169840006258
121. throughout history poland has been the corridor through which	the enemy has passed into russia	1104.896734626421
122. twice in the last thirty years our	enemies the germans have passed through this corridor	1640.4738114503111
123. it is in	russia's interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a	position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force h	2852.884487528934
124. it	is necessary that poland should be free independent in power	750.5258207218852
125. therefore	it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the	soviet state	1571.6140807050995
126. in other words the soviet union was determined	to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against	germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any	question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the soviets	or posing as an independent balancing power in between russia and	germany	8048.690524117526
127. byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used	the same security argument to justify their course in poland	1576.285747644342
128. this reasoning	was also as inevitable as anything could be	566.5603308650986
129. any free elections	that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government	in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west	for free voting by anti-soviet elements in poland would be met	by	restrictions on voting by these elements	4691.769462595768
130. in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern	europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with	the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into	russia as a part of hitler's armies	6600.826835000558
131. but at yalta the conflicting	expectations of east and west were merged into an agreement by	the big three to assist all liberated countries in europe to	create	democratic institutions of their own choice	3651.1428037844285
132. in any case where	in their judgment conditions require italics added they	would form interim governmental authorities broadly representative	of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest	possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive	to the will of the people	6924.3411135163815
133. other similar affirmations in the	declaration on liberated europe seemed to assure democratic institutions	on the western model	1567.8506108346487
134. later it developed that the soviets had	a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed	later and their judgment never told them that the big three should	unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them	within their zone of influence	6695.9171379870095
135. professor mcneill thinks that	at yalta stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him	that he thought the exclusion of the anti-soviet voters from east	european	elections would not be greatly resented by his allies while	neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly faced the fact that in poland	at least genuinely free democratic elections would return governments	unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness	5813.065752998404
136. also war-time propaganda and cooperation had obscured	the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy	and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil	the military victories over germany and japan	5916.617376114831
137. the application	of these formulae could not please both sides for they really	attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable	2037.9682604364436
138. while obliged	to concede governments in east europe allied with the soviet union	instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and	economic system in east europe	4976.748202188235
139. this illusion was described	in a far-sighted editorial in the new york herald tribune on	march 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace	treaties to the senate	3336.3432690653326
140. in doing so marshall and byrnes were asking	for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international	life	3046.4419848311195
141. we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory	automatically establishing our system throughout the world	1106.2758200750982
142. we	were troubled about the fate of the baltic states	562.76371951345
143. yalta left us with	comforting illusions of a western capitalist-democratic political	economy reigning supreme up to the curzon line and the borders of bessarabia	2461.5443719968807
144. this is a penetrating description	of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than east	europe	2107.965740357233
145. the same editorial continued that we expected to democratize	japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily	on our institutions	2460.37339113169
146. we expected in short that most of the world	would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple	from such a position to deal with the localized aberrations of	the soviet union	5919.382856536994
147. yet actually the image corresponded in no	way to the actualities of the post-war world	1097.6518940534604
148. neither our military our	economic nor our ideological power reached far enough to determine	the fate of east europe	2582.1859999815388
149. then the editorial added prophetically:	how far they may reach in asia is yet undetermined but they fall	far short of our dreams of the war conferences	2827.471570165407
150. here is	the best short explanation of the origins of the cold war that has been	written	2121.8185996257066
151. failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite	treaties president truman re-declared the cold war on march	12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald	tribune editorial was written and a year after the cold war	had been announced by churchill at fulton missouri in truman's	presence	5220.278833560457
152. then china promptly went communist and mr truman	had to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of	korea before we learned how far our writ did reach in asia	4991.974032438766
153. years of war strain and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures	and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the united	states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world	a	while the cold war raged it was easy to blame	it all on yalta	4959.523415991235
154. yet in summarizing a series of careful essays	on the yalta conference forrest pogue could find no basis for yalta	becoming a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents	of roosevelt and international cooperation	5807.480038917886
155. when the yalta papers	were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal	by anyone	1412.2415319099953
156. an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts	561.7837050346944
157. first	is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning	and discussion	939.3495052761318
158. preparation began slightly more than a year after	independence with the first steps to organize rural communes	2142.2663245500717
159. all	political interests supported electoral planning although there are some	signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to	some procrastination	2309.6993163916586
160. the second major aspect of the election is the	actual procedure of registration nomination and voting	1882.4635987515546
161. considerable	technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was	generally above reproach	1099.1148905117045
162. however the regionally differentiated results	which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems	of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances	3890.90884297865
163. a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy	is the results of the election	1420.804909921044
164. the electoral procedure prevented	the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested	parties including the government itself were busily engaged in	determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the	month following the elections	5764.749402979758
165. the fourth and concluding point will	be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they	figure in the current pattern of internal politics	2715.706946422046
166. elections	have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official	address since independence	1417.9911151938722
167. they were stressed in the speeches	of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed	and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council	3325.27303531776
168. king muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation	of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections	on may day 1957	4262.401840138102
169. there followed a long and sometimes bitter	discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 in	which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most pessimistic	view and that the istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic	4382.4503170271855
170. since the complicated process of establishing new communes and	reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the french did not even begin	until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious	5008.906593194062
171. from	the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues	in moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were	most difficult to resolve in the new government	2969.5606474511264
172. until the charter	of liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no guarantees	of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes	4268.694910555239
173. the	istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 but the pdi	the most important minor	party at the time objected to the istiqlal's predominance in the	civil service and influence in radio maroc	3562.594458775532
174. there were rumors that	the ministry of the interior favored an arbitrary non-political	process which were indirectly affirmed when the king personally intervened	in the planned meetings	4268.669464033157
175. the day following his intervention	the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that h the	possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral	lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation	itself h would be supported by the king himself	4625.3177736616435
176. the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration	of elections but french consultants were called in and notices of further	investigation appeared from time to time	4653.364559592181
177. in january 1958 the	minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready	to be submitted to the king the rumors of election dates appeared once	again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer	4115.158826814012
178. although	the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 the	first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied	3467.713078400614
179. in late 1957 the mp appeared	and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the istiqlal was	revealed when the third council of government under balafrej was formed	without support from progressive elements in the party	4045.4461931579535
180. the parties	were on the whole unprepared for elections while the people were	still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after	effects of poor harvests in 1957	4262.978334971756
181. despite the internal and international	crises that harassed morocco the elections remained a central	issue	1101.4952456066903
182. they figured prominently in the balafrej government of may	1958 which the king was reportedly determined to keep in office until	elections could be held	3882.0432552786515
183. but the eagerly sought homogeneity	of the balafrej council of government was never achieved as the istiqlal	quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development	2733.1925893777393
184. by december 1958 when 'abdallah ibrahim became president	of the council elections had even greater importance	1895.6723589978815
185. they were	increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural	communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort	2331.53447821986
186. to minimize	the chances of repeating the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government	was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created	in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections	5788.451994368025
187. by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete	780.6452008219273
188. there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws	through the labyrinth of palace politics and making a small number	of	policy decisions	3691.3157572950486
189. from the rather tortuous history of electoral	planning in morocco an important point emerges concerning the first	elections in a developing country and evaluating their results	2729.1070761314413
190. in	the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving	fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and	also as a source of policy guidance	4671.448072417597
191. in the absence of a reservoir	of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections	will give them new prominence but in a system where there is	as yet no place for the less prominent	3947.0972188830756
192. lacking the respected and effective	institutions that consensus helps provide minority parties such	as the pdi in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction	in 1958 clamor for elections when out of power but are not at all	certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power	7308.969345853354
193. those	in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral	process	789.2085547932857
194. the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest	rather than an instrument of national interest had two important	effects	on electoral planning in morocco	4088.7595252610104
195. at the central level	the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form	of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been	recommended by duverger and favored by all political parties	3766.8147320211415
196. the	choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent	by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas	of the country but it also served to minimize the national political	value of the elections	6328.29396725321
197. although the elections were for local officials	it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties	from publicly identifying their candidates	2597.1844416164026
198. with multiple member	districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have	operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to	state their positions more clearly	4279.217704361073
199. both parties and the ministry of	the interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth	the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby	give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political	significance	4142.663397211953
200. since a national interpretation cannot be avoided	it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize	party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation	4976.019170465079
201. the general setting of the moroccan election may	also encourage the deterioration of local party organization	1246.4004789444089
202. the concentration	of effective power in rabat leads not only to party bickering	but to distraction from local activity that might have had many	auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections	5453.214916330062
203. interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber	of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national	elections	2169.725181583196
204. the istiqlal sponsored umcia	was opposed by candidates of the new unfp	in nearly all urban centers	2109.309851777864
205. as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy	businessmen the umcia was generally favored	against the more progressive labor-based unfp the	newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party	expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them	as they had done for many years	4976.519533983892
206. the local istiqlal and umcia	offices did not campaign and lost heavily	951.50469239902
207. the	value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political	participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest	as shown in table 1	2995.447815626255
208. the chamber of commerce elections	were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune	elections	2356.01818727134
209. the unfp learned that its urban organization	which depends heavily on umt support was most	effective	1251.904617055734
210. the istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of	the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete	precise problems of internal politics	3682.3889870103676
211. the overall effect was probably	to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than	might have otherwise taken place	1877.6982592714771
212. a second major point of this	essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections	1884.401231848921
213. although	a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications	as the above discussion of the voting system indicated	1723.1341701044591
214. furthermore	the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of	the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential	to evaluating election results	4082.231694401303
215. the sine qua non of the elections	was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure	944.7676868760402
216. as the	background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts	that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer	elections	3038.8835787188277
217. the pdi and later the popular movement protected	the istiqlal's privileged position until the fall of	balafrej and then the istiqlal used the same argument which it had	previously ignored against the pro-unfp tendencies	of the ibrahim government	4043.671826043137
218. the bulk of the preparation had	of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior	whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally	disinterested in party politics	5168.393669584856
219. apart from some areas of recurring	trouble like bani mellal where inexperienced officials had	been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened	in the electoral process	2973.779925009561
220. centrally however the administrative	problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely	an unfair advantage	2818.7405387864114
221. the king decided to remove ibrahim a week	before elections and to institute a non-party council of government	under his personal direction	2184.214168065722
222. although the monarch had frequently asserted	that the elections were to be without party significance his action	was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor	4269.907900357042
223. the new council was itself inescapably of political meaning which	was most clearly revealed in the absence of any unfp	members and the presence of several istiqlal leaders	2970.6438484576684
224. since the	details of the elections were settled the change of government had no	direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have	been	more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp	voting preparations began in the fall of 1959	although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes	was completed in 1958	8289.99513722593
225. there were three major administrative tasks:	the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the	registration of candidates	1871.6517927088419
226. voter registration began in late november	1959 and continued until early january 1960	1184.0515228380361
227. the government was	most anxious that there be a respectable response	501.2926962229012
228. periodic bulletins	of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process	into a kind of competition among provincial officials	2833.049125555134
229. a goal was fixed	as given in table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment	1102.3614159673648
230. the	qualifications to vote were kept very simple	250.5839933145972
231. both men and women of	twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof	of residence and identification	1881.8396246962093
232. there were liberal provisions for	dispensation where documents or records were lacking	957.9792277897083
233. the police were	disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals	and those punished for protectorate activities	1571.8034806192586
234. the	registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution	since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit	of a reliable census	4272.714090302418
235. unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment	in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to	secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future	3436.085650013413
236. some	vocational training schools provide such training but the current	need exceeds the facilities	1415.7859106402607
237. the present federal	program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of	the smith-hughes act which provided a continuing annual appropriation	of $7 million to support on a matching basis state-administered	programs of vocational education in agriculture trades industrial skills	and home economics	4620.664386816689
238. since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related	acts have extended this federal program	1187.1095343191673
239. the george-barden	act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to	$29 million in addition to the $7 million under the smith act	2593.0761044180135
240. the	health amendment act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse	training	1179.0605361670046
241. the latest major change in this program was introduced	by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of	which amended the george-barden act	2590.5823198814896
242. annual authorizations of $15	million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national	defense needs for highly skilled technicians	3035.9032251470976
243. the federal	program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage	the establishment of vocational education programs in public	schools	2021.173418510392
244. the initiative administration and control remain primarily	with the local school districts	956.8271364911928
245. even the states remain primarily in	an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training	947.1826678791853
246. federal	assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the	state or local districts must pay at least half	3036.112326605825
247. the state may decide	to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state	may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it	3314.108422478963
248. throughout the history of the program state government expenditures	in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures	while local districts all together have spent more than either	federal or state governments	5489.5993728397925
249. today federal funds account for only	one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education	935.9024830659979
250. the	greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially	encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough	to obtain their full allocation of outside funds	4638.198682121347
251. national defense	considerations have been the major reason behind most federal	training expenditures in recent decades	1254.6009131648768
252. during world war 2 about	7	65.71440605545367
253. 5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special	programs administered by state and local school authorities:	vocational education for national defense and war production	training	2980.0137607802126
254. the total cost of the five-year program was $297 million	562.7187638300582
255. for the smith-hughes george-barden and national defense	act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years	was only about $740 million	2468.8546757506692
256. no comparable measures are available	of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education	training	1405.7921667748224
257. there are a great number and variety of private commercial	schools trade schools and technical schools	1259.850086689279
258. in addition many large	corporations operate their own formal training programs	751.5712106986638
259. a recent study	indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations	conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations	2165.2601779303136
260. most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still	acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions	1401.9646629999227
261. the national	manpower council of columbia university has estimated that	three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have	not been formally trained	2849.138767496326
262. there is little doubt that the students	benefit from vocational education	752.1470165843631
263. employers prefer to hire youth	with such training rather than those without and most graduates of	vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training	2844.7231775878654
264. vocational	educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled	workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills	3036.7073643692875
265. in most states trade and industrial training is provided	in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities	2181.6767709676715
266. in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade	and industrial courses	1892.0441277977486
267. in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools	have programs and in pennsylvania 11 per cent	1406.8217080237837
268. an important	recent trend is the development of area vocational schools	751.1120328001282
269. for	a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have	been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve	nearby school districts in several counties	2708.4688411691664
270. these schools are intended	to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not	be possible for very small school districts	3048.02518929047
271. transportation may be	provided from nearby school districts	167.0878260492083
272. courses are provided mainly for	post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are	made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses	also may be conducted	4844.1537302937595
273. the title 8 program of the national	defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward	area schools	2170.5850068910127
274. by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states	743.5381839912465
275. they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor	surplus and in 10 of the minor areas	2019.3218733272042
276. an extension of this program into	relation to new	some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been	related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their	desire to attract new industry	5612.52504897912
277. the major training need of a new	industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a	large number of semi-skilled machine operators	2455.1066628983926
278. a few key skilled workers	experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought	in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere	4664.415298695834
279. a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run	advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers	and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees	3216.8763887121827
280. the existence of a public school vocational training program in	trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled	3492.5762018934993
281. additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs	worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff	and program are in being	2726.3031830870314
282. thus besides the training provided to youth	in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary	benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development	efforts	4804.234330961996
283. few states make effective use of their existing vocational	education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new	industry	1872.8590821643852
284. the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their	vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis	to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly	local focus	the major weakness of vocational training programs in	labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands	7755.13255553413
285. this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent	in the system of local school districts in this country	2290.1096153432336
286. planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to	local employer needs for trained workers	1874.219533206096
287. all the manuals for setting	up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local	survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs	and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and	their content	4286.646547281034
288. furthermore there is a cautious conservatism	on the part of those making local skill surveys	1651.952064232552
289. local jobs can be seen	and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical	1102.6081936928601
290. while the u s department of labor has a	program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and	publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence	that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum	planning	6044.081161009101
291. the u s office of education continues to stress	local surveys rather than national surveys	1098.4249430939524
292. this procedure is	extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history	of declining employment	2105.634623561157
293. elaborate studies have been made in labor	surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job	vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify	training programs for those skills	3530.7551918663994
294. no effort is made in the same studies	to present information on regional or national demand trends in these	skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other	skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be	trained	6574.87020661298
295. moreover the current information on what types of training	are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary	1576.4002235990615
296. there	simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that	are in demand and the types of training programs that are required	or most suitable	4619.880813401085
297. much of the available information comes not from the	federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states	1733.2223903198835
298. state and local agencies in the vocational education	field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities	3034.4652110160328
299. there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide	research and information to help guide state education departments and	local school boards in existing programs	2863.655567911118
300. a related question	is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided	1647.4306332028416
301. there is little evidence that existing public or private training	programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in	their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence	payments and are not guaranteed a job	4028.7517855415886
302. however there always is	some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire	training	2590.784477634412
303. again one major difficulty is the local focus	166.52997277577487
304. a	training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there	is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards	and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely	at jobs in the local community	6274.238754568866
305. if there is adequate information on job	opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be	expected to respond	1878.5401328364067
306. another problem is who will pay for the training	391.48026484225346
307. local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic	about vocational training	641.5583579590977
308. programs usually are expanded only	when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand	it	1889.4281056825719
309. even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support	for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it	2307.1333051179668
310. state	governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational	schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities	3038.1777971753077
311. only	the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and	nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower	needs	2859.9488266031017
312. if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational	education it could be argued that the state should not have to	bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in	other states	5765.381670905479
313. however if federal funds are used it would be entirely	appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere	as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment	3436.4021797513205
314. such training	would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find	jobs in other localities	2340.1648846693324
315. a further possibility is suggested	by the example of the g i bills and also by some recent trends	in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide	financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local	facilities are inadequate	4297.951947887594
316. this probably would require some support	for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no	greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth	conservation corps	5185.744539345904
317. a maximum of $600 per year per student would	enable many to take training away from home	1418.686766547511
318. a program of financial	assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest	in training highly skilled labor	2367.4125311774123
319. instead of being limited to the poor	training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to	move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training	2720.6383259090007
320. such	specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly	growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist	and	where the future employment opportunities are located	4464.652244092958
321. this would heighten	possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension	training	506.59171975982406
322. personal financial assistance would enable more	emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual	1888.059895011775
323. his aptitudes	and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper	training	944.5019577927685
324. but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its	inferences	747.3361179933082
325. then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had	further forecasting significance	945.7381164880848
326. and then the application of the	count rules to the width of the configuration give us an	intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline	4093.447676781992
327. the very idea	of their being count rules implies that there is some sort of proportion	to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and	the extent of the breakaway movement	3432.7335782949135
328. this expectation	is what really sold point and figure	391.61643406439094
329. but there is no positive	and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense	790.6168961647675
330. experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and	in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations	and intensities of events	3909.7913874156193
331. after all too much does not happen too	suddenly nor does very little take long	1090.7603231635303
332. the advantages and disadvantages	of these two types of charting bar charting and point and	figure charting remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation	among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying	in common one irrevocable merit	6190.070016833491
333. they are both trend-following	methods	14.839945070527069
334. even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum	the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is	always	more likely to continue than to reverse	4984.12036327212
335. of course many	more things are charted besides prices	262.5779847637624
336. the foregoing have been methods	of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices	that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting	abilities	5150.903816848715
337. the search for forecasting	formulae is ceaseless	93.60080087218317
338. correlations have been worked up between	the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price	2118.7402741034125
339. the theory	behind this is of course fundamentalist in character	375.05518144243035
340. as the number	of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate	increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings	implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock	market prices	5163.677370639668
341. we now know that things rarely ever work out in such	cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting	enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn	before stock prices turn	3721.4657373583605
342. but the quest for such an index	goes on ceaselessly with all manner of investors and speculators participating	ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the	proverbial shoe-string operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily-	and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell	the eternal secret: which way will the market move; up or down	8031.131599246119
343. it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth	a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships	2581.6568684282724
344. just	as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who	carry on the quest for the enchanting index	3039.588690648627
345. much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty	wind-swept towers	1094.073582805561
346. there sit men who make moving averages of	weekly volume monthly averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of	the number of advances to the number of declines ratios of an individual	stock's performance to overall market performance ratios of rising	price volume to falling price volume odd-lot indices and what not	7375.461205935487
347. they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao	coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc	1420.0795811599291
348. and along	chicago's	west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the	merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop reports who divide	the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs	and the number of hogs by the amount of corn	6899.789700547999
349. they plot the open	interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide democratic	congressmen by republican congressmen	1415.5103224532106
350. all these things and countless	more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains	non-forthcoming	2123.0816149421976
351. not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word	503.53486564098165
352. the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these	endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index	is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth	5026.368993079446
353. but whereas civilized	men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit	of the enchanting index	1574.6140828350838
354. we mentioned odd-lot indices a	few paragraphs ago	250.01023381838414
355. in the stock market the normal trading package	is a hundred shares just as 5000 bushels is the standard grain contract	package	2190.3867556842238
356. a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed	via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange	3276.3108653539557
357. this	results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades	from the overall volume of trading	1432.6823757726274
358. according to the theory underlying	odd-lot indices the trader who trades odd lots is most likely	a small trader one who can't afford to trade round lots	4272.6327245980265
359. or to	use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent	a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders	2173.802029457942
360. falling	most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders	can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders	do marketwise is taken to exemplify the wrong thing to do	5646.410065587393
361. figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales	are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers	2028.1020627833907
362. odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their	particular statistical recipe	1647.9394635460667
363. they might for example plot it exactly	as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer	moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases	to odd-lot sales	3854.7648148721028
364. the particular recipe is a matter of individual	taste	393.57633575570713
365. the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price	chart usually of a popular stock average	1400.6484083040382
366. towards the end of	an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price	chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply	4475.795147900257
367. this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite	likely to be a top	1249.8045705066634
368. similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle	towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while	the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic	that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist	that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood	7619.4056101090155
369. thus in the aggregate	the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the	bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions	2329.488581113196
370. while	it had long been known in general that the public is always wrong	the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical	basis	4290.149920564529
371. one might well wonder why the public is always wrong	and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned	with the chicken and the egg	3018.248011026758
372. which came first	0.30041514999999996
373. is it really that	the public buys at the tops and not that the market tops out when	the public buys	2032.712575342382
374. and the converse at bottoms	22.099965265045533
375. does the public	usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually bottom	out when the public sells	1565.4824143047708
376. we have been using the word	public in quotation marks that is in its vernacular connotation	with reference to the odd-lot index theory	3480.9831817008753
377. obviously someone has	to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa	934.8124797299937
378. and while all concerned	are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned	although still a majority form the quotation marked public	3698.8013391599357
379. and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated	element- the element on the other end of the public's	transactions	2036.3685590503671
380. this element is often called strong	hands	139.13720894646067
381. strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations	are the primary movers	940.637481886031
382. they initiate campaigns so to speak	even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action	only psychologically organized	3056.1546813307673
383. strong hands act; weak hands	react	43.05615593935151
384. strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on	750.0838622550599
385. when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even	in the face of bearish news reports	2173.5377448966665
386. they are able to sit more patiently	with what they have bought	960.7978065022884
387. needless to say strong hands are	not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that	they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up	at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign	4503.216934891138
388. certain	badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there	is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about	this interplay of competitive forces	4291.712889244081
389. but after all can anyone imagine	a market wherein the reverse of these things were true	1257.2222484056633
390. try to	imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and	the majority would make consistent profits	3067.554674346694
391. how much and how many profits	could a majority take out of the losses of a few	1413.3683482372858
392. moreover	the taunt concerning the sophisticated echelon and its alleged	erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues only	upon results; not before	3906.4430843270616
393. it quite often happens that campaigns go	askew resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands	into played-out hands just as a member of a former campaign's public	may emerge flatteringly right the next time	3849.5168384121985
394. membership	in the echelons fluctuates too	65.55789995631856
395. the study of odd-lot indices	is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow	what with all observers trying to get on the side of the few	at the same time	3936.166528465613
396. the usefulness of this study and of configuration	analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination	of its use	3020.0046009524685
397. it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of	the word few	941.8513355425841
398. diametric opposition must persist as to	the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all	2819.482177362198
399. and	the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement	would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable	2981.3349214761943
400. there need be no squeamishness about admitting this	252.51012563329232
401. anyone	still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited	to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what	the minority loses	3113.3491028940457
402. mr john magee whose work has been discussed	in this chapter was quoted in a new yorker magazine profile	as saying- h of course you have to remember it's a good thing	for us chartists that there aren't more of us	6450.067622587365
403. if you got too	many people investing by this method their operations would begin to	affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off	2475.4954517794094
404. the method would	become self-defeating	22.27486639294262
405. mr alexander h wheelan's	study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers- we	assure you that the total number of people using this method of	market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating	in the securities and commodities markets	4745.292576748887
406. what with	traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there	being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading	techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to	imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough	fans to invalidate itself	7619.242057836258
407. nevertheless all theories and techniques	lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead	to a market committment at all	2452.1297919817043
408. in the final analysis then the user	becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding	any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate	4289.717764398303
409. thus	while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace	for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed	2174.675670746278
410. though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the	possible conclusions remain but two	1874.662486085455
411. the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book	was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge	of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already	in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself	the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that	is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests	for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead	0.20124717349522497
412. in assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the	question as always is the prospect for general business activity	2829.3612426810337
413. by	and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship	between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and	will thus determine interest rates	3119.3305106383896
414. moreover the trend of general business	activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary	and other federal policies which affect interest rates	3913.4752566561706
415. nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business	activity	645.1393670247638
416. during much of the year the general level of business	activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been	persistent signs of slack in the economy	4670.456171304277
417. the tendency for general	business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident	792.2176185836637
418. although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year	has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion	that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961	and possibly somewhat longer	6440.364609490537
419. it is difficult to see any powerful	sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the	economy a new upward thrust	2596.038936095434
420. the rate of plant and equipment spending	by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some	decline	3041.545497214923
421. in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually	experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage	financing became easier to obtain	2470.665862986679
422. at this time however there are	signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with	the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction	4464.296589034866
423. these signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of	the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments		1570.625489997999
424. on the other hand in a more favorable vein general	business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal	spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably	run a good part of its course	5645.318644252445
425. the 2% increase in retail sales in october	to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well	as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference	board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans	4235.0464255973475
426. the pattern of general business activity which probably lies	ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961	before a new rise in economic activity gets under way	5161.671419806908
427. the recovery	will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring	in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by	an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending	and some rebuilding of business inventories	4367.186953404444
428. what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend	of long-term rates in 1961	1642.8176924709671
429. it suggests that during the next several	months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital	funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to	move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local	bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds	5081.151535021918
430. however	as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well	as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the	over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that	any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great	7323.573281509288
431. it seems likely	moreover that with an increase in the rate of	saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential	mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although	the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily	in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment	and amortization terms	5230.122877116914
432. if the trend of general business activity	follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional	steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability	of credit	4854.026364322972
433. certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would	be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the	banking system	2463.8544711760896
434. however the monetary authorities will continue to	be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with	respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow	of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive	liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of	monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle	8604.450966821258
435. one of the most intriguing questions is	whether the recent departures of the federal reserve authorities from	confining their open market operations to treasury bills will spread	into longer-term government securities in the next few months	3871.1140317253403
436. to	the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal	reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire	maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek to force	down long-term interest rates	5790.118504962068
437. the principle of bills only	or bills preferably seems so strongly accepted by the federal	reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade	the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open	market purchases regularly into long-term government securities	4551.375623913278
438. however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort	to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market	operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act to	accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result	of market forces	7236.199672730606
439. by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming	that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should	begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery	and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to	restrain credit availability	4622.202668663441
440. my guess would be that interest rates will	decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half	of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during	the downturn	5622.2562180219975
441. it is pertinent to ask the question: has the	long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about	run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital	market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline	of interest rates	4848.4547334837835
442. my answer is in the negative because i believe	that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press	against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to	be firm at high levels	5632.9330258429345
443. this view is based upon	several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in	recent events in the general	assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain	with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future	4370.779875416673
444. this makes	it certain that federal expenditures for military preparedness and	foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several	years	3702.245682585829
445. we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the	friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless competition	of the communist bloc	2856.508514178696
446. our efforts to overcome the lead of the	russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending	2364.6191523523994
447. moreover	it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster	rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist	countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better	than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas	such as education housing medical aid and the like	5294.541487607431
448. there are	serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures	of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur	4061.550880519615
449. during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping	up in the rate of household formations which should contribute	to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building	3322.5120085202425
450. according	to the latest	projections of the bureau of the census the annual	rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years	3686.5182762538316
451. under	the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the	census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise	from about 883000 in the last two years of the fifties to an annual	rate of about 1018000 in the first five years of the sixties and	to a slightly higher annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	decade	5706.522435047659
452. during the seventies the projections show a more pronounced	rise to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade	3473.5833626046747
453. accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing	occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the	general economic prospects of the sixties	2739.259051368869
454. however the impact of	a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated	1871.9957135994136
455. the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in	with	the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial	rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems	to be indicated	4799.002511574501
456. this is an area in which there is still a large backlog	of demand	1397.3640255135374
457. state and local expenditures increased	persistently from $26	167.5853862046039
458. 5-billion in 1949 to $44	22.1815251698021
459. 3-billion in 1959 and	it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this	decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion	by 1970	3107.3314265063404
460. here would be a powerful force for raising business activity	563.3432045461378
461. the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures	should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties	2042.4058130383976
462. spurred	by keen competition in our industrial system and still further	increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment	expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade	5167.191090215803
463. i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing	which was dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 is finally	in the process of running dry	3225.797118596101
464. there is some clear-cut evidence	of this	138.91288216681943
465. for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans	for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have	largely exhausted itself	2732.838854142561
466. indeed the failure of home-building as a	whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage	financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and	rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part	that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an	end	7770.59377988239
467. in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles	today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car	coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of	the frills which were accepted in the fifties	4838.323450534817
468. the huge backlog of demand	which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war	was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the war and	even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and	home loan fields	7256.630059276019
469. the consuming public has used up a good part of these	liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level	and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer	or home mortgage terms easier	4372.8554591109905
470. this is not to say that the level	of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties	2572.9203995245325
471. i	am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will	not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized	most of the fifties	3215.1249610179475
472. markets should become more competitive	as consumers become more selective	569.0093375302918
473. accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely	to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to	require enormous amounts of capital funds	3344.380826458682
474. wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of	forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases	3474.607961254609
475. the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which	has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a	significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few	very important industries	4046.8335762448214
476. while there may be several such industries	to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular	claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages	and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world	war 2	6903.834958483536
477. indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude	in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the	model here presented	2461.8315691508665
478. the model of this paper considers an industry	which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but	which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous	critical public scrutiny	5485.319735375693
479. where the industry's product price	has been kept below the profit-maximizing and entry-limiting	prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers	have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands	3769.4302053278866
480. the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition	and an exploration of some of its implications	2590.5975787953957
481. in order	to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call	the effect of public-limit pricing on key wage bargains	we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces	such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation	4746.928606361341
482. for	expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells	out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the	public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence	of union pressures for higher wages	6574.484891514076
483. part 1 below describes	this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions	633.2605298918938
484. part 2	discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant	conclusions	1181.1361428689775
485. part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy	implications of the conclusions	641.2291100393957
486. part 4 is a brief summary	65.33056912827979
487. the	mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is best read	after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the equations	may be explicit	2596.01682973699
488. the industry with which this model is concerned is a	basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product	2835.864456602437
489. for the purposes of setting the product	price the industry behaves as a single entity	1106.5875430144956
490. the demand	we are concerned with aggregate	demand for the industry's product	967.3042840962884
491. the manner in which this is shared	among firms is taken as given	791.5138555634801
492. in any given time period the aggregate	demand for the industry's product is determined by two things:	the price charged by the industry and the level of gnp	4480.171084281206
493. for	the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed	in these two variables since gnp includes other prices	2175.90910650605
494. the form of	the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary	inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of	gnp	4298.47759728046
495. the industry of	this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected	with a public interest	1879.4373156015695
496. because of its importance and because the	lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable	public pressure not to raise its price any more than could	be justified by cost increases	5614.655840798393
497. the threat of effective anti-trust action	provoked by gouging the public through price increases not	justified by cost increases and fears of endangering relations with	customers congress the general public and the press all operate	to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases	4622.338564560617
498. for the	industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the	past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing	price and even	below the entry-limited price	5330.845747619982
499. for	such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an	increase is manifestly justified by rising costs		1450.4178570891036
500. thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to	the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function	of the wage rate	4094.9395191003327
501. in this model we abstract from all non-wage	sources of cost changes so that the public-limit price only	rises as the wage rate rises	2476.8933890242583
502. in such circumstances it may well be	to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage	rate	3252.838758975792
503. since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the	profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated	and is likely to remain well above the latter	3106.250660951072
504. the entry-limiting	price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but	unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately	throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price	to approach the entry-limit price	5642.251843078468
505. the foreign-entry-limit price would	be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign	costs directly	1412.6509730643695
506. where this approach becomes critical the industry	can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its	sincerity in resisting the wage pressures of a powerful union	requesting	tariff relief after it has reluctantly acceded to the union	pressure	6582.383885125464
507. whether or not it is in the industry's interest	to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent	to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage	increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying	the wage increase	4943.490367083574
508. the extent to which the public-limit price	is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a	function of three things: the passage of time the level of gnp	and the size of the wage increase	6313.462456150594
509. we are abstracting from	the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to	which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic	wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the	industry	4752.522850260095
510. the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure	on the union but in order to educate the government and	the customers of the industry	4297.832024657602
511. as a strike continues these parties increase	their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement	1265.3869850484443
512. they become	increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry	claims the wage bargain would entail	2362.305320935534
513. public indignation and	resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases	are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are	on the order of 3% per month	3656.9556929102714
514. the simple passage of an additional	eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable	1883.9309678204693
515. thus	the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase	the longer it has been since the previous price increase	2177.1858300248923
516. notice however	that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices	per se without an accompanying wage increase	3030.1951266034944
517. similarly higher	levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds for raising	prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that	it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase	3943.7218960912783
518. this is not	extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the current	level of gnp affects the public pressure against wage-price increases	3472.647639302594
519. finally since the public requires some restraint on the part	of the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately	larger price increases	a price increase of 7% a wage increase of 10% allows a price		3039.6385008230345
520. we	assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation	is constant with respect to quantity produced		and is the same for every firm	4285.657807416437
521. the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology	and so forth	1095.569235879276
522. as we have noted however we are abstracting	from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in	the wage rate	3465.3864021011445
523. the level of average cost is	e	93.50952566595014
524. union policies and collective	the single union which faces the industry	does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply	of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate	5774.763346192908
525. the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter	of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with employment	makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain	full employment	3943.555695417853
526. the union vigorously demands wage increases from	productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living	increases but we abstract from these forces here	3496.0013242700784
527. for our present	purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage	rate	and it is this basic wage rate which determines the	level of costs	3217.736451525704
528. productivity is something of an amorphous concept and	the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even	well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public	5634.2020649169535
529. disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the	problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity	increase should be shared	2724.065876110588
530. the existence of conflict and of	vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict	the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living	and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase	in the basic wage rate	6700.830720985563
531. we assume further that the union	recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate	increases and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price	increases arising from its own wage increases upon the real	wage rate	4036.0996001553212
532. for internal political reasons the union asks for	increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose	a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate	upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry	6808.558182709033
533. changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and	they constitute an argument for raising prices	1257.1926113576678
534. however it is not known	to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase	is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the	companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude	6571.305275569728
535. in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that	they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since	such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may	in circumstances to be spelled out in part 2 below find it to	their advantage to allow the wage rise	5333.197110008658
536. thus for non-negative changes	in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter	since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason	of industry acquiescence	4986.038106831029
537. the presumption in the literature would appear	to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on	the grounds that it is clearly not in the interest of the industry	to raise wages gratuitously	4030.7341632855764
538. from this presumption it is an easy	step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate	must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed	in our model	5629.635038467899
539. it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do	so by disproving the presumption on which it is based	1719.052820515757
540. of the model	it is convenient to assume that the union-industry	contract is of one year's duration	2130.8896267989535
541. in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international	law	944.1380632241535
542. several factors contributed to this change	64.5735066541649
543. the	congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both	epitomized and symbolized what was to follow	1728.4894551408647
544. here in 1815 the great	nations assembled to legislate not merely for europe but for the world	2119.1262107486355
545. thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system	that was central to world politics for a century	1878.8527478144467
546. international	law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not	fit this	system or the interests of the great european nations collectively	could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense	5639.404035817786
547. essentially	this imposed two conditions: first international law had to recognize	and be compatible with an international political system in which	a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic	in their political alignments with one another; second it had to	be compatible with the value system that they shared	4923.418467222941
548. in both respects	international law was europeanized	140.12420531298304
549. it was not always easy	to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions	1266.4999467378912
550. on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis	each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality-	thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of	action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system	required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous	napoleonic experience	7693.887724969124
551. but there was no pressing need to maintain	these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world	2030.6287643458786
552. thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the	smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed	and less powerful societies elsewhere	4097.550373719158
553. political interference in africa	and asia and even in latin america	by the special interest of the united states as expressed in	the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european politics	was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values	and the european balance itself	4828.674419134726
554. a nation such as switzerland	could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect	its neutrality; more doubtful but possible	was the neutralization of the latin american countries;	out of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa	6560.073704809848
555. this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of	19th century scholars	1101.145352139975
556. more emphasis was put upon the fact that international	law was the law of civilized nations; kent and story	the great early american scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase	or of christian nations which is a substantial equivalent	6177.793145635581
557. wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the	civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european	origin	2330.744446224935
558. of course it had always been of european origin in fact	but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory	3500.5701371427117
559. now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin	of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules	thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be imposed	on others	3866.8387730328095
560. the european customs on which international law was	based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were	to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states	5600.13393203217
561. hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said	states outside european civilization must formally enter into the	circle of law-governed countries	2585.3721986655737
562. they must do something with the	acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance	of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction	4811.180714205745
563. during the nineteenth century these views were protested by	virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just	as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect	today	3445.41744209896
564. a number of other nineteenth-century developments	contributed	to the transmutation of the law of nations into international	law; that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into	particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states	5900.330446747722
565. the difference	is important for although the older law of nations did cover	relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain	2450.7904825932687
566. the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to	their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually	unified system	3697.5891960491704
567. the theory of international law which in the nineteenth	century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america	broke this unity and this universality	2715.2571251702225
568. it lost sight of the	individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise	of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice	or morality save as these values might affect international relations	5635.06220741612
569. no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine	what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit	his freedom of action	3327.0835024639937
570. to appreciate this development we	must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy	1399.3078504169866
571. first	and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to	regard the state and the individual's identification with the state	as transcending other ties of social solidarity	3110.358805057227
572. national identification	was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout	europe as new unifications occurred	2584.3261699554496
573. it reached its ultimate	philosophical statement in notions of state will put forward by	the germans especially by hegel although political philosophers will	recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of hobbes	3446.491288833834
574. national	identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which	incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international	simply as its formal reflection	3686.587380567815
575. in the international community	this reduced law to jellinek's auto-limitation	373.286144121595
576. a state the	highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected	to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent	3892.5494249121048
577. according	to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign	was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical	predecessors	2340.0530380565765
578. he no longer sought to find the law; he made it;	he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be	3484.3081123943716
579. there was	no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged	by or consented to by states	1562.412732387343
580. hidden behind hegelian abstractions	were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence	961.8298435908713
581. related	to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy	in one form or another	1256.124675381791
582. increased participation in politics and	the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic	effects upon law institutions	2825.899317621258
583. the efforts of various interest groups	to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when	taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration	of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby	policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions	4758.0514424696
584. law became a conscious process something more than simply	doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for	applicable norms	3491.190241908317
585. particularly was this true when the norms previously	applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly	changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed	3105.3505491572655
586. the	old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community	with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer	adequate to the task	4287.365081362389
587. first was the period of codification of existing	law: the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification	that in fact resulted from austin's restatement and ordering of	the common law in england	3548.40702452429
588. codification was followed in all countries	by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting	the older law much dealing with entirely new situations	3876.2579269424555
589. the legislative	mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes	were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority	was delegated in one form or another to the executive	3668.123072479234
590. whereas	the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the	nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied	with law	4283.142506766283
591. indeed with developed positivism the separation of law	from justice or from morality generally became quite specific	1424.7449063323272
592. in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as	fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power	of parliament- the elected representatives- at the expense of the	more conservative judiciary	5631.03363268838
593. when the power of the latter was made	both limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and made more precise	and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary	hands- two purposes were served: government was made subservient	to an institutionalized popular will and law became a rational	system for implementing that will for serving conscious goals for embodying	the public policy	5707.6435150638745
594. it is true that initially the task	was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free	flow of money goods and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious	policy	4992.630058216683
595. law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will	377.10059016891495
596. however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather	the parliamentary sovereign of austin	1646.7313558152018
597. it was too an optimistic	philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means	an immoral or amoral one	2330.7552841899897
598. man through democratic institutions	of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny	1405.8656481867856
599. the theory	did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian	mystique	789.6665528878056
600. it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions	of popular government	1176.0294371343498
601. it was not opposed to either justice	or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials	who wielded public authority	2174.129474277679
602. particularly was this true as	laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of western society	1412.8087638199816
603. to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising	bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental authority-	administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely	and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be	abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and	notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the	free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with	the new politics and the new economics be done away with	0.20124717349522497
604. contract-	conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced the implied	obligations of a more static and status-conscious society	2840.3692398056455
605. indeed	contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone	of the free society	1262.0182569496967
606. government itself was based upon contract; business	organization- the corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms;	trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and	borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen	as a contractual arrangement	6554.408354943665
607. it is not surprising that the international	obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract	1405.3842916118592
608. in	fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as	to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal	norm pacta sunt servanda	4655.350065540646
609. the displacement	of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth	and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law	theory and doctrine	2046.6070423624526
610. in the first place the new doctrine brought	a	formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier	view that both were parts of a universal legal system	4656.320848438243
611. one result	was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations	1100.4584081143535
612. admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise	in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country	were all severed from the older law of nations and made dependent	on the several national laws	6323.620164623803
613. private international law	was thus segregated from international	law proper or as it is often called public international law	1727.8268405062092
614. states were free to enact within broad though determinate	limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their	courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard	to many claims arising on the high seas	6585.933160018928
615. the change was not quite	so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be	invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation	and then largely in marginal situations	3759.456054588171
616. mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article	1 power	1649.488646803212
617. in this view supported by only three members of the	court a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3	was granted by the generality of article 1	3099.3503672101992
618. if this seems arbitrary	its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally	with citizens of the states- at the expense of expanding a troublesome	jurisdiction	4635.228712078494
619. for almost	a hundred years we relied upon state courts	for the protection of most rights arising under national	law	1877.1542066504821
620. then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing	influence of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts	general authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide	cases involving federal-right questions	5321.042113925019
621. one purpose of the change	was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the civil	war amendments against state interference	2024.0404629169432
622. serious difficulty arose	with the advent of substantive due process	559.6741085986991
623. an amendment presumably	designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became	a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic policy	2034.8391692253822
624. a flood	of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of	local government	1407.0114782893982
625. congress reacted with a series of measures modifying	in various ways what it had granted in 1875	1408.087621470622
626. in 1910 it required the	convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain	injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the supreme court	3909.5370398479668
627. such	legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter	499.7629243579043
628. in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction	proceedings upon institution of state court test cases	3039.6519935653596
629. the essential	ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial	elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate	orders	2194.332292321096
630. three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions	against collection of state taxes	1391.1705673043846
631. this saved for state adjudication	in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions	had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable	2606.7218214593463
632. meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings	concerning this aspect of government by injunction	1646.2186557842892
633. drawing upon	the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes	introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated	in mr justice frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention	2960.8180454900535
634. whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability	of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of	the state policy at issue	4291.687012179982
635. the classic case is railroad commission	v pullman	167.73480752361402
636. the commission had issued an administrative order	which was challenged as discriminatory against negroes	1411.5661097701595
637. its enforcement	was enjoined by a federal trial court	264.2280901606772
638. on review the supreme	court via mr justice frankfurter found southern racial problems	a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought	not to enter unless no alternative to h adjudication is open	5783.518237018037
639. an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether	the offending order had in fact been authorized	2037.0092792488626
640. reluctant as usual	to interpret state legislation- such interpretation can only be	a forecast rather than a determination- mr justice frankfurter	led a unanimous court to vacate the injunction	4651.9460927959735
641. but it is crucial	that here unlike burford the trial court was ordered to retain	the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity	to settle the state-law question	3347.2416931752814
642. the resources of equity are equal	to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as	well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication	4477.999073138917
643. temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing;	refusal to adjudicate is another	644.6045019689527
644. to the extent that the jurisdictional	principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation federal	equitable relief against state action must be available- or so	it seems to mr justice frankfurter	4993.760635009363
645. in alabama public service	commission v southern ry co the commission had	refused to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facilities	2034.658787926599
646. the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process	of law sought injunctive relief	1408.4849163772153
647. the court held that federal	jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state	be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion	2733.6995233665793
648. justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result	for they found no merit in the railroad's claim	2347.4923376210913
649. but they objected	vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise	jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress:   by	one fell swoop the court now finds that congress indulged in needless	legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937	4692.81488378692
650. by	these measures congress so the court in effect now decides gave	not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that	the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 against	all proceedings challenging local regulation	6430.126043168061
651. a most	revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln	mills	642.4797644832016
652. the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction	over suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a	labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce	4480.434409008117
653. on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does	not establish any law for the federal judges to enforce	2032.7993466250646
654. how	can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when congress	has created none	1416.0955125731007
655. the court held that congress had intended	the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management	contracts	1574.5127775097076
656. in short congressional power to grant federal-question	authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress	need not create or specify the right to be enforced	4488.472349692447
657. the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal	common law which as mr justice frankfurter pointed out	in dissent leads to one of the following incongruities:	conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective	bargaining agreements; displacement of state law by federal law	in state courts h in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements;	or exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters	5846.22124393239
658. the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history	of the provision in question suggests that congress' purpose	was merely to make unions suable	3455.3705545894254
659. with a few exceptions the lawmakers	seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction	involved- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges	2858.8534906779337
660. to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter	was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned	with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction	3692.9707313359622
661. this	would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the suability	of unions	783.3589796333201
662. it would also leave intact the states' traditional	authority in the realm of contract law	1649.2425827681047
663. and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases	here again mr justice frankfurter	could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial	legislation	2461.5255836898295
664. if congress wants to displace the states from areas	which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly	3047.585928002763
665. and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal	judges	944.2000785474984
666. does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction	over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be	authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages	4669.197311800583
667. there is a common problem behind most of these federal question	and diversity cases	940.3658434596093
668. congress has not clearly defined the bounds	between state and federal court competence	1190.6608555229168
669. it has the power to do	so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on	a case-by-case basis	2477.441853400626
670. a careful student has suggested that in any	new revision of the judicial code the legislators would do well	to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should	be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law	might be used leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation	of pronouncing state law	8108.441843006835
671. obviously the goal here proposed is the	guiding principle in mr justice frankfurter's opinions- to	the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion	2589.610327616904
672. the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in	the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area	and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review	4820.201512939873
673. mr justice black	no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to	achieve a generous and just result	2178.5535339086455
674. he will not be fooled	by technicalities	140.2012816978106
675. with few	exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority	to enforce rights arising under federal law	1580.2354783712512
676. to put it differently	state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect	to most claims of federal right	2598.4513009900484
677. to insure uniformity in the meaning	of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme	court review	1576.4304627622982
678. it may be noted parenthetically that to evade	desegregation	an ex-justice and former southern governor has urged	congress to abolish this reviewing authority	3469.555295952895
679. the result of course	would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in	different states	1411.0948677313763
680. it would also probably mean different things within	the same state- depending upon what court rendered	decision	2120.9537605872106
681. we consider here only a few of many problems involved	in this crucial federal-state relationship	1095.9587969451568
682. the first is that enforcement	of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old	diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance	3863.928562589996
683. subject to	certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level	of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures	2167.339261321723
684. litigants	who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that	court subject to its rules of procedure	3042.262028103902
685. a similar canon applies to those	who press state claims in federal tribunals eg in diversity	cases	1400.9307952555926
686. in an fela	controversy the state court followed established state procedure	by construing a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant	3054.8258211830803
687. in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon	the pleader by state law	1093.569903471785
688. the result was that the plaintiff's case	was dismissed	390.3764349980764
689. mr justice black led a reversing majority: strict	local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens	upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law	2839.255754947403
690. here as	in the byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed	to federal judge-made law	2111.511433206856
691. justices frankfurter and jackson dissented:	one state may cherish formalities more than another one	state may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms	2459.6636482567687
692. if	a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court he	cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who	press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form	in which the claim must be stated- the particularity for instance	with which a cause of action must be described	8300.420828077937
693. federal law though invoked	in a state court delimits the federal claim- defines what	gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it	2598.202214403396
694. but the form in	which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state	exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long	as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined	by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities	of litigation	8125.063851590285
695. another problem in the area of federal-state	relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in	a state decision	1567.280641421685
696. terminiello v chicago involved a conviction	for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance	1185.6693059151671
697. the conduct	in question was a speech	93.84970825954741
698. the accused did not object to the trial court's	charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of	the peace if it stirs the public to anger invites dispute brings about	a condition of unrest h	6075.024509286389
699. for present purposes it may be assumed	that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal	constitution	1886.2234814790904
700. though the accused raised many other objections he	did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings	3018.8304707122006
701. that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his	case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right	2851.7811493631766
702. how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right	to amortize bond discount and premium but not	the right to amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction	for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization	but not a deduction for theft losses	sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered	after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depeciation	but not allowing rapid amortization of	emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or allowing survival	of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company	381 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes	0.30166232349522504
703. these items and most of the others listed above seem	quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section	381	2447.9255355797777
704. there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction	either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of	tax-avoidance possibilities	4275.185983541719
705. with respect to items such as these the	provisions of section 381 viewed in historical perspective suggest	a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or detrimental	to the surviving corporation	3447.3965018794092
706. to this extent some stretching	of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since	the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the	language of the statute	4989.526165976858
707. it is not contended that section	381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes	1566.9775996871683
708. such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction	of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of	congress as expressed in the committee report; and in at least	one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another	provision of the united states code	7321.3276425954755
709. section	203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a claim against	the government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due	has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been issued	4051.915931117951
710. if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this	section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for	taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization	meets the requirements of section 381	6195.8816379984655
711. a clearly recognized	exception is a statutory merger or consolidation	378.16466068709144
712. the leading case	seaboard air line railway v united states held that	the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor	and it has been consistently followed	4990.407016550787
713. the court said the purpose	of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment	and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger	to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous	claims against the government	4457.194542743505
714. neither reason said the court applied	to the case at hand; furthermore congress could not be presumed	to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states	4252.42378293895
715. other	exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions	transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation	1568.2912941732327
716. exceptions	are often classified as transfers by operation of law	560.039405109879
717. a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation	statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an operation	of law mold	2603.060486849655
718. although it is in some ways comparable to	a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly	applies the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations	in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund	of taxes paid by transferors	6968.091192882833
719. a recent case in point is mitchell	canneries v united states in which a claim against the government	was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose	partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed	by the partners	4294.479346264975
720. holding the final corporation entitled to sue on	the claim the court cited the seaboard novo trading and roomberg	cases for the proposition that h transfers by operation	of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not	assignments prohibited by the statute	6901.188919117539
721. in an earlier case	kingan + co v united states an american corporation	was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation	in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british	corporation	3035.0304631175177
722. the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the	american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british	corporation	3476.8329848552094
723. the transaction presumably would have qualified under	section 368 as a contractual reorganization followed	by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368	as a statutory merger of consolidation	3211.9275765766984
724. the court nevertheless relied	on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders	of the two corporations were the same	3032.5218403773024
725. in substance said the court	there was no transfer of equitable title	640.2681470488701
726. the treasury arrives	at substantially the same conclusion but skirts the problem of section	203 of the united states code	2803.6738244202766
727. revenue ruling 54-17 provides	that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been	liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund	should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the	corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor	corporation	5265.069215227961
728. proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also	be filed	752.5919736438071
729. if the succession is a matter of public record certificates	of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody	of the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record	all documents relating to such succession properly certified are	required	4465.668862045326
730. the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger	or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition	2125.62555658811
731. the ruling	would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash	781.5459269155258
732. a recent	ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev rul	54-17	970.1348476851574
733. the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory	or contractual reorganization	939.1702512931
734. hence a successor corporation	in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes	paid by the merged corporation despite section 203	3884.0285405681543
735. in a b	reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those cases	which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation	appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes	paid by the transferor	4098.568699377263
736. in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's	stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer	a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not	applied to eliminate the intermediate step	5788.9555579919015
737. as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two	primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states	code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more	than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims	on a contingent-fee basis	4886.285861931231
738. the cases have allowed transfer of claims	if beneficial ownership is not changed	1177.9903140285965
739. the first reason would never	apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section	381 which is the only type presently under discussion	2614.8200430638526
740. section	381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary	owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation	an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets	solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form	or place of organization	7538.185444715302
741. in virtually every case the transferor corporation	is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright	or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise	to the tax	3338.860860579465
742. in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting	claims is exceedingly remote	1184.8330487378823
743. furthermore in a c reorganization	the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation	which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger	to which the statute is clearly inapplicable	3663.6675138304627
744. nor is it	at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will	be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization	4290.136762630058
745. if the transferor has substantial assets other than the	claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to	acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim	for refund of taxes	4037.445906625691
746. if such an unlikely transaction were to take place	it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed	by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed	by liquidation	5306.849257192392
747. in the rare case where a corporation's only	substantial asset or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps	its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization	takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets	for stock	4626.6172780617535
748. it appears then that although the matter is not	dealt with in section 381 a successor corporation in a reorganization	of a type specified in section 381 is entitled to sue for refund	of taxes paid by a transferor corporation	6311.0948631770825
749. section 203 of the united	states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against	the government transferred in tax-free reorganizations	2178.734515917383
750. the successor	corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims	949.8157916690847
751. tax attributes of the transferor	there are certain tax attributes	of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts	of the particular reorganization involved	2878.5150398118853
752. for example property used	in the trade or business of a transferor corporation as defined	in section 1231 presumably would not retain its special status following	a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business	of the acquiring corporation	6590.909482612871
753. the parent of a group filing consolidated	returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization	defined in section 368 but as a different corporation	for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation	which had not for example elected to file consolidated returns	with its own subsidiaries	5004.02367472626
754. similar considerations presumably made	it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring	corporations have different methods of accounting	or depreciation	3694.86021515258
755. other sections	of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of	a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization	2180.0171559153378
756. section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis	for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on	the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee	4993.562778070989
757. section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities	to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period	1422.2163686949534
758. however	a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for	attributes similar to a loss	there may be certain items which are quite similar	to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right	to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions	applicable to those items	7710.676529274196
759. for example suppose another excess profits	tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of	excess profits credits	1879.2386386756323
760. this carryover right has a number of things in	common with a net operating loss carryover	1886.4150363001402
761. it is an averaging device	intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income; it is a tax	benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects	to have a high excess profits tax	3959.1038713360044
762. under the 1939 code this item	was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton	brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learned hand	who wrote the majority opinion in the sansome case a leading case	requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization	7292.74837991491
763. since this type of item was not in the statute when	section 381 was enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect	the enactment of that section should have	3314.1825512124606
764. with respect to this	type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee	report quoted above which cautions against using section 381 as a	basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein	5783.5641599568535
765. actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable	to a net operating loss carryover	1726.4126382236968
766. probably the primary reason	for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique	opportunity it presents for tax avoidance	3266.95562671104
767. there were two	methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the	resources available: interviews in depth with a few selected	companies and the more limited interrogation of a large number of	companies by means of a mail questionnaire	4385.091939606793
768. while the method	of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the	opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and	circumstances of a company's practices and opinions it also involved	the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems	of just a few individual companies	7768.910583094689
769. as a result it was decided that	a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more	effective in determining the general practices and opinions of	small	firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems	of defense procurement that concern both industry and government	4944.0880115836235
770. it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest	fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more	detailed nature	4088.9564394955064
771. it is recognized that a mail questionnaire	has inherent limitations	371.47364391280047
772. there is the danger that the questions will	mean different things to different respondents	1410.6098165554067
773. simple yes or	no answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the	various respondents may have	1716.0422241807682
774. a respondent may want to make alternative	answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed	in the question	2814.4190439385075
775. there is also the problem of the respondent's frame	of reference	501.07426104958165
776. is the respondent making a recommendation for his own	benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific	government department or service for the benefit of the defense	program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the	taxpayers	7034.178470694514
777. there is also the question of whether the respondent	based his answers on factual information and carefully considered	judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses	2727.9572998791655
778. finally there	is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held- whether	it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly	over the alternatives	4866.041024574425
779. the research team was very mindful of	these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire	1095.198734087922
780. under the circumstances	however the team considered it would provide the most useful	information at this point	2113.1986533894997
781. in the preparation of the questionnaire	the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure	and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these	limitations	2976.8547139898924
782. the questionnaire was	designed to elicit three types of information: the facts regarding	certain characteristics of the respondents including their experience	with and interest in securing defense business; the actual	selling and buying practices of the respondents; and the attitudes	and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and	the methods of awarding defense contracts	7892.188050775362
783. it was hoped that the facts	concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would	offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the	recommendations which they did	3448.0586890981313
784. the major sections of the questionnaire	are devoted to the following:	information for classifying respondents	characteristics of defense sales activities	respondents' practices in participating	in advertised bidding for defense business	respondents' practices in participating in	negotiated bidding for defense purposes	respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding	respondents' opinions regarding	negotiated bidding	respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense	contracts   the questionnaire	provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification	of the respondent was optional	0.30166232349522504
785. the questionnaire also stated	that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially	939.5444754622928
786. it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the	questionnaire identified themselves	2102.2404655062446
787. the questionnaire	the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire	over a period of six months	1408.3744034665901
788. in june 1960 an early draft	of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen	companies in the state of washington	3687.5709294531466
789. several days after the companies	had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted	the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone	to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have	experienced in completing the questionnaire	4391.605679514921
790. this test resulted in	further revisions of the questionnaire	390.6312432666206
791. the research team was	concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might	not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might	be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made	4050.767854343487
792. accordingly	another test of the questionaire was made	250.60185657786815
793. the revised draft	was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout the united states	1099.5633992620014
794. fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3500 names	submitted by member companies of the aerospace industries association	and fifty were selected in a similar manner from	a list of 1500 names compiled by the research team from the thomas	register	7052.96438031136
795. the method of compiling the aia and	tr lists will be described later	789.6738802919514
796. ten days after the questionnaires	were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging	those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do	so at once	4259.457153164492
797. twenty-eight returns in all were received	43.19272920519672
798. the responses	were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions	that were apparently not understood by the respondent	3263.1149829035007
799. the cover	letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then revised into	final form	of mailing lists	the objective of the study was to determine the	opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs	3745.772685382176
800. the	firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective	in mind	1184.5017644797351
801. three lists of companies were made and used in the	study	502.71175311945024
802. the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies	located in the state of washington which were personally known to	the research team to be active in defense work	4641.919394423645
803. the primary consideration	in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the	questionnaire with company officers	1564.7693517061566
804. the second list was derived	from a group of approximately 8000 names supplied to the research	team by the aerospace industries association	3273.382821224929
805. these names were secured	from member companies by the association from the forty-four sources	listed in appendix f	1578.7048951114452
806. each source selected from its approved	bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses	that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems	4641.011275320264
807. where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with	the company name and address	1266.5716313856105
808. the forty-four lists supplied	by the aia member companies were merged and duplicate names were	eliminated	1873.6669155448756
809. there was further elimination of all companies that were	not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive	1725.6833628731915
810. the	remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list	and duplicate names were removed from the aia lists	2822.4538680862356
811. by these steps the final aia list was reduced from 8000 to 3500	791.2267010931613
812. the third list was selected by the research team on a random	basis from the thomas register	2136.6728712145205
813. it was compiled as a control sample	to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the	lists	submitted by the members of the aerospace industries association	were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense	programs	4290.5590538955785
814. such a difference might have resulted from:	the fact that the aerospace industries association members whose	lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs	4453.499560221365
815. the fact that companies on the aia lists were already	participating in the defense program because of the manner of their	selection	2173.8565879706207
816. accordingly as in-group they might have different	opinions	and practices than an out-group composed of those companies	not so participating but interested in defense business	3885.034207748394
817. the fact that aia lists might not have been selected on a random	basis	944.0942120550593
818. the control sample was selected by taking the bottom	name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical	listing of manufacturers in the thomas register	5007.84289353752
819. if the bottom	name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified	the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was	substituted	2736.700426078302
820. fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion	249.29979040195067
821. mailing the questionnaire	each questionnaire was mailed with a	cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive	of each firm	2180.4006304867276
822. the questionnaires were mailed in seattle washington	and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of idaho montana	oregon and washington	3462.4321530216985
823. airmail was used for the addresses outside	the pacific northwest	375.73275630233144
824. each letter contained a postage-prepaid	return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific	northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest	3875.4183102643337
825. approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a	follow-up	airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names	1881.5610652973232
826. the	first test mailing was made in june 1960	392.80341370911333
827. the second	test mailing was made in july 1960	261.7860913365673
828. the final	mailing of the questionnaire was made late in august 1960 to 4900	firms consisting of 3450 from the aia list and 1450 from the	tr list	4503.396586802089
829. returns received	over 1000 returns were received	within two weeks after the final mailing was made	1256.2813791317326
830. they continued	to arrive until the end of december 1960 by which time a total of	1343 returns were received representing 26	3244.999826758895
831. 8 per cent of the 5014	questionnaires	sent out	260.2382461272887
832. fifty-seven returns could not be used because	they were incomplete or received too late to be processed	2113.05845595574
833. the remaining	1286 returns that were processed came from the categories in table	2	939.1190876745235
834. each questionnaire was audited	for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial	number by the source list from which the company name was selected	and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark	on the return envelope	6935.602888707361
835. all responses except comments were	numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment	781.3094829729538
836. the codes	were key-punched	into ibm punch cards and verified	563.2751057155859
837. each return	required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns	644.1110041478279
838. in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company	each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified	with the appropriate serial number of the respondent	5644.49269596719
839. the cards were	then processed using standard ibm punch card equipment including	an ibm 650 computer	1248.6547555744223
840. the first step in processing was	to analyze the returns from questions 1 2 and 3 to determine	whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses in	accordance with the definitions contained in aspr section 1-701	5921.986506242393
841. the results are shown in table 3	93.59225776926327
842. the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside	and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions	and practices of small firms	4813.024022336542
843. the second step in processing	was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with	those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether	it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of	the study	4480.289014356832
844. the methods and results of this comparative analysis are	described in appendix h	1180.8836078843199
845. it was concluded that it would be appropriate	to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all	small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense programs	3435.8572757095963
846. in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics	and practices that were more representative of companies	that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the aia	list alone	5932.712875250907
847. the vast central valley of california is one of the most	productive agricultural areas in the world	1421.774814370781
848. during the summer of 1960	it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle	1890.3699877094066
849. the contestants in this economic struggle are the agricultural	workers organizing committee of the afl-cio	and the agricultural employers of the state	2191.2877149374344
850. by virtue of	the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the	farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between	these two forces	4283.481923473749
851. it is not a pleasant or easy position but one	we have endeavored to maintain	1099.4150750007734
852. we have sought to be strictly neutral	as between the parties but at the same time we have been required	frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose	5002.257867466355
853. inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless	of how we ruled	937.1865680834353
854. often the displeased parties interpreted our decision	as implying favoritism toward the other	1187.8838799441369
855. we have consoled ourselves	with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one	of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding	2853.846939061718
856. it	is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss	knuckles down to growers and then to be confronted with a growers'	publication which states perluss recognizes obviously phony and	trumped-up strikes as bona fide	5745.834062036019
857. for a number of years	there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers	1255.3207672668766
858. these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons	749.2125974071157
859. they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and	lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole	1582.128060115217
860. this past	year the pattern has been different: the organizing program had the	full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and money	to the awoc as well as moral support	5042.363359157606
861. leadership was experienced	and skillful and financial resources were significant	373.30157585580525
862. regardless	of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure	to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts	of life	3905.7003563003586
863. as a result of these changed conditions the impact	of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations	has been much greater than in the past	2613.5790067279554
864. the awoc has been able	to employ the traditional weapons of labor- the strike and the	picket	line- with considerable success particularly in the area of wages	4282.730828515935
865. by the very nature of the situation it is the union which	has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management	2731.799711984293
866. to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been	selective; that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity	in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside	engagement with management throughout an area or the state	6944.261991831149
867. primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral	obligations under our farm placement program	1423.5627188856192
868. normally because	agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would	not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade	dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although	such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility	6558.377499187556
869. but the current	issues arose out of the wagner-peyser act concerning referrals	to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of public	law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican nationals were	employed at the ranch	4136.659971258842
870. most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser	act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the	development of public placement services	3912.770542345524
871. infrequently do we think	of it as a living continuing operating control over the system	1101.2835120898258
872. however	when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play	748.4524491959297
873. california has accepted the provisions of that act	by enacting into our code a provision that	the state of california accepts the provisions of the	wagner-peyser act h and will observe and comply with the requirements	of that act	4134.921541599193
874. with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser	act states only   in carrying out the provisions	of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for	the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they	are referred to employment	6666.026358218811
875. other provisions of the act empower	the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions	and he has done so	2184.4282012970875
876. the pertinent regulation for our purposes	is section 602	393.80155368813996
877. 2 as follows:   referrals in labor	dispute situations	167.32260644838072
878. no person shall be referred to a position the	filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which	is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked	out in the course of a labor dispute or the filling of which	is an issue in a labor dispute	7913.679635856264
879. with respect to positions not covered	by subparagraph of this paragraph any individual may be	referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided	he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time	of his referral	4595.105027045755
880. in analyzing this regulation let us take	the last sentence first	746.4412140484931
881. it permits referrals under certain circumstances	even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is	given written notice of such a dispute	2483.469999921319
882. assume for example a situation	where a farm has a packing shed and fields	1430.2390361664598
883. the packing shed workers	go on strike	94.52321200330059
884. there is no dispute involving fieldwork	65.37509840216369
885. we concluded	that we may refer workers to the fieldwork	provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute	2035.0123868414503
886. so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision	559.9068089213811
887. it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue	781.4624089653005
888. note that it prohibits referrals under either condition	or condition	561.5237220054333
889. employer representatives have contended that the secretary	has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the	grounds that the wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to	the prospective worker that a dispute exists	3770.6757259477563
890. the matter	got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes called	by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county	4090.1056707911
891. we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left	their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute	2326.6550296927826
892. accordingly	under clause of the secretary's regulation we suspended	referrals to the employer	1177.1518476853148
893. the employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged	our right to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the superior	court of yuba county	2600.7626864068143
894. the court issued a temporary restraining	order directing us to resume referrals	965.8557766122528
895. we of course obeyed the court	order	94.48734586367628
896. however the attorney general of california at the request	of the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over	the issue removed to the federal district court on grounds that	it was predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's	regulation was being challenged	7140.293459151391
897. however the federal court	held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagner-peyser	act into its own code and presumably therefore also the	regulations it was now a state matter	3571.715830491716
898. it accordingly refused to assume	jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court made the	restraining order permanent	1896.734790319575
899. under that order we have continued referring	workers to the ranch	502.80842994134673
900. a similar case arose at the bowers ranch	in butte county and the superior court of that county issued similar	restraining orders	3280.860948748933
901. the growers have strenuously argued	that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive	and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision	in the secretary's regulation	3335.264842996546
902. i cannot accept that view	either as a lawyer or as an administrator	1196.9901925213182
903. first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved	507.32128550644177
904. it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior	court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent	2822.7875298615863
905. it	is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to	the particular action which was heard	1417.8625761815597
906. it is not binding upon another	superior court which could rule to the contrary	1403.7182739165999
907. only when a decision	is rendered by the district court of appeal	is a binding precedent established	1416.641835916336
908. in that event	we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation	of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence	that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts	5916.5224341354515
909. but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent	decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts	which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a	correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal	law	4389.48175263251
910. i believe i am in good company in this view	556.8390996235206
911. the attorney general	of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal	from these decisions to the district court of appeal	2328.6301194798025
912. the attorney	general of the united states in considering the power of the	secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-peyser act	relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered	an opinion sustaining his authority	5935.488399312943
913. further and as an evidence of	legislative intent only the senate of the united states recently	defeated by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the	fair labor standards act which would have specifically limited	the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matters	4564.204564241307
914. next	let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications	of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals	2837.601468919526
915. there is far	too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter	hanging in midair	1881.0870538201937
916. the ramifications of the issue are enormous	141.42795083550052
917. a	decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have	to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in	effect place the public employment services in the position of acting	as strikebreakers	3950.7585816475876
918. the public interest is so dominant in such an issue	that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative	order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action	in one or two superior courts in the state	6683.198451663108
919. it is an issue which	may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial	finality is achieved	1880.8639598564564
920. as an administrator i cannot place	the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance	with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of	appeal open to me	5476.265079861516
921. to have applied statewide the decisions of the two	cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us	clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have	immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so	inclined to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for	hearing and issue his finding	5563.4346933052775
922. the impact of noncompliance under	the wagner-peyser act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million	a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service	program or as a corollary the taking over by the federal government	of its operation	6492.190080185838
923. thus far the cases which have come before	the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is	vacant due to a strike- condition in the regulation of the secretary	3567.098710881579
924. none has yet arisen under condition relating to referral	to jobs the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute	3272.7026208278653
925. here the problem is essentially one of defining the word filling	507.89065153299146
926. should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements	as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and	the like	3505.5112496367474
927. or should it have a broader connotation of including wage	demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the	mechanics of filling the job	2461.553307024523
928. because of the uncertainty	of this definition i solicited the interpretation of the secretary	of labor	1878.320750570978
929. he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the	proper one; that is that if wages for example is the only issue	in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the	dispute we may continue to make referrals	4536.678153548723
930. martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young	children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual	level simply by combining objects and counting them	4662.177322998633
931. after they	have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating	objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely	2471.12648958494
932. the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age	558.7549995501885
933. one	experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between	the eleventh and twelfth years	949.0789231826008
934. many studies indicate that	elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science;	that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes	and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities	change and broaden	5929.568928688679
935. how a child	feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting	him in school may have as much influence on his success in school	as his physical and intellectual characteristics	3554.2681041342753
936. a considerable amount	of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not	likely to do well in school subjects	3464.3203827295415
937. emotional maturity is the result	of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the	first few years of the child's life	2334.9660717109878
938. however the teacher who understands	the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential	in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction	3472.002449630688
939. concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping	children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter	11	2021.3535710182762
940. the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics	of elementary-school children may be helpful	1179.4683043986306
941. typically	the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short	time as contrasted to those of an adult	1727.5423583148167
942. as the child grows	older his emotional reactions lead to moods or emotional states	drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in	short abrupt outbursts	4816.155619651623
943. studies of the growth and decline	of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects noises	falling and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years	but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures	or robbers increase	4365.896869751026
944. ridiculing a child for being afraid	or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing	with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations	the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared	object place or person with something pleasant	7046.53347957606
945. children	need help in learning to control their emotions	260.2551614010543
946. the young child	learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking	and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns	that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers	and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions	7133.536794912378
947. children differ widely in their emotional responses	94.06462627610824
948. among infants	the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence	of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized	3270.8364086767215
949. although no national norms exist	for the social development of children the teacher can find a great	deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed	by children at various age levels	3563.865656395729
950. the following summary will	give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school	children; the student will certainly want to explore more	deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling	to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn	the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which	they hold membership	8426.155706188556
951. during early childhood children	are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than	they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in	school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases	and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once	considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family	gatherings now considers it a bore	0.20124717349522497
952. in late childhood the influence	of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase;	the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in	and the ideals of right and wrong behavior	6190.2666086450345
953. in early childhood	the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his	own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do;	such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not	influence his choice much at this time	5159.335604376831
954. in later childhood	an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group	a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness	to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits	6039.5551022678455
955. during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average	more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in	these activities more than do well-adjusted children	2996.1785542430416
956. during	late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls;	girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics	of boys of their own age	5032.739508709843
957. by the time pupils reach the sixth	grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed;	they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems	but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the	terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work	4820.0734337282065
958. between	the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult	authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline	3707.087586313395
959. however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to	substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers	2591.284570054768
960. the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability	to work in groups	959.208474799649
961. the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously	with one companion but his desire to be first in everything	gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with	people but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate	4372.105752725747
962. in the middle grades	however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities	such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on	group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise	5616.373960679371
963. the teacher should study the individual pupil	much progress has	been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding	children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children	whose needs are not being met by the school program	4463.823634655024
964. some are failing	to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never	seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom	3899.620292123317
965. these children	have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults	who did not understand	1713.3043456578137
966. many school systems now employ school	psychologists and child guidance specialists	748.7299006208242
967. these specialists	perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children	who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs	of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical	services for severely maladjusted children	4113.376450484902
968. it is the classroom	teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a	unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice	4083.5924251098113
969. indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work	of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional	chore	2466.7142033730443
970. teachers and administrators in many elementary schools	have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the	basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals	5306.4919972696525
971. what they should recognize is that children who have been placed	in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely	in attributes that influence success and that they still must be	treated as individuals	4030.4517837157155
972. although the teacher must be concerned with	maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding	factors that inhibit	studies conducted in various	sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary	schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are	failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects	7582.147306188255
973. one study	which involved 1524 pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent	of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading	a year below capacity	3319.65565467268
974. it is apparent therefore that the teacher	needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and	adjustment of children	3497.7439246729678
975. when a child fails to meet the standards of	the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other	forms of maladjustment frequently follow	2594.2613108861233
976. these maladjustments in	turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed	966.4428932561716
977. it is	easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving	in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the	child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who	is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent	4685.7992837421825
978. the causes of retardation	and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective	speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail	constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning	5183.110457875567
979. they may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating	and sleeping habits	1093.0185775038822
980. they may be related to mental immaturity or lack	of aptitude for certain types of school work	2124.6740688955547
981. the curriculum may	be too difficult for some and too easy for others	791.4092572946936
982. teaching methods	learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead	to maladjustments for some children	2126.9631100371603
983. unwholesome family relations	broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing	factors	937.6488926524162
984. this is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit	learning and contribute to maladjustment among children	2368.8915188209075
985. moreover	these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner	642.0447767777364
986. a	vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading	disability	for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement	in reading	3874.6064710821556
987. an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute	the motivation causing another to work harder for successful	achievement in school	2171.2138981300873
988. at any rate the teacher who recognizes common	causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal	to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment	4674.408669897903
989. successful teaching	involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand	why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement	in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment	3753.7947821959146
990. the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the	use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist;	he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information	needed about each child in his classroom	6802.573118406403
991. he can be expected	however to examine and interpret the information already available;	to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children;	and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular	classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his	pupils	4444.3237823137715
992. this section deals with some of the sources of information that	can be tapped by the classroom teacher; chapter 15 provides more	detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil	progress	5160.998321253153
993. most school systems today maintain	a system of cumulative records of pupils	636.4276465033166
994. these records when systematically	maintained provide much information about the children which	the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting	to parents	3691.1397687719123
995. each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped	with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders	2037.242061758272
996. during	summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of	the principal	1425.9323618652206
997. only the teacher and other professional personnel are	permitted to see or use these records	1103.553586315896
998. each new teacher to whom the	pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record	and to bring it up to date	3894.518179244528
999. some school systems provide written instructions	to principals and teachers designating when certain information	is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how	the information is to be summarized and used	3545.84871468723
1000. the summary report on desegregation progress in education in	the middle-south region 1959-1960 clearly shows two pieces of	information	2588.584581770598
1001. the summary report which was prepared for this conference	indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is	increasing; second that both actual and pending desegregation is	with few exceptions the product or result of court order	3949.602148911039
1002. the report	together with other information suggests that desegregation in the	schools is slow	1410.8945282036298
1003. the middle-south region as defined by the	national association of intergroup relations officials	consists of the states of kentucky maryland tennessee west	virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia	3218.0421416881545
1004. the	states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation in	fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of	the staunchest opposition	4303.692166694641
1005. desegregation has been opposed by massive	resistance interposition pupil assignment	and hate bombings	782.5595193987199
1006. now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation	and such increase as a result of court order	3047.0309782448226
1007. elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties	which already had high school desegregation	1102.1138783802926
1008. the action was a result	of a court order the citation for which	is taken from the summary report for this	conference	3267.6471090992263
1009. in maryland the harford county board of education	had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but	which a plaintiff had challenged; thus county school board and federal	court joined hands here to promote school desegregation	3976.314009164388
1010. additional	school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court	order opening a school serving children of military personnel	2368.8946728882493
1011. similarly	further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee	cities chattanooga knoxville and memphis	1255.4868894692145
1012. in west virginia	the number of white and negro children attending the same school	has increased almost twofold	2355.727407880121
1013. there are no court decisions here	43.688847289346434
1014. as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan	of school desegregation in delaware	1891.3579965672532
1015. as a result of the state	board of education plan negro children entered heretofore white	elementary schools in five districts	1874.4749302941666
1016. the third circuit court of	appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan	1193.038863494124
1017. in virginia	court orders led to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd counties	641.1082673519384
1018. desegregation in pulaski county is pending because of court	order although date of admission is not yet determined	2361.1668446647604
1019. negro parents	have filed application for admission of additional children to schools	in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren counties	1720.7657401322044
1020. desegregation	can also result from additional suits brought by negro plaintiffs	against school boards in newport news fairfax county arlington	county and norfolk	3491.0395226986902
1021. as a school district the district	of columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 shortly	after the supreme court decision	1881.8586114308644
1022. this recapitulation makes	it clear that school desegregation continues including the old dominion	state in spite of its stern resistance	2819.137825104839
1023. the record is clear that	increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result	of a court order; that on the immediate horizon if further large-scale	desegregation comes it will result from court	orders on suits filed in several middle-south states	4474.041017379974
1024. knowledge	that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that	school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads	to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow	4651.323637531471
1025. before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at	this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary	report as it refers to the district of columbia	3840.432950792393
1026. that reference	in the report is continuation of the trend toward an all-negro	school system a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of negro	school population from 74	4471.078807189728
1027. 1 per cent to 76	14.77445603464152
1028. i see no	real prospects for an all-negro school population	562.7305957112901
1029. west of rock creek	park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white	as a result of georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program	2325.4175382106982
1030. nearby foggy bottom is ousting negroes	65.61236932223508
1031. the large acreage	in the southwest redevelopment area beckons white people- what with	high-priced town houses and elevator apartments	1726.096193438206
1032. the capitol hill	rehabilitation like foggy bottom replaces negroes with whites		395.10469277535674
1033. the sharpest	break with tradition the past and present of white ring around	a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county	suburbs to negro residents and presumably the consequent conclusion	of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by fleeing to	the suburbs	4834.494664248492
1034. in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville	maryland white people may have to live with negroes	2583.460825826574
1035. all	of this must be taken into account before the image of an all-negro	dc public school system is conjured up	2026.979771926249
1036. solve	from the summary report before us at this conference a number	of problems are apparent	1867.4841979713067
1037. they vex us and perplex us but generally	do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems	1733.3937546739332
1038. first how can we step up the desegregation movement	393.37989636745664
1039. it is slow	0.20041515
1040. i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together	can and do attend	1897.026073358164
1041. i believe we all want no child denied admission to	a school on account of his color	1410.5866490532026
1042. in general members of nairo	would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence	or within his residence zone	3261.07589761158
1043. how to achieve this objective is	a problem but we are not divided on what we want	1411.2978733667283
1044. second as	we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves	how can we achieve this action through school board action	3472.218564153529
1045. it may be county school board or state school board action as well	as that of municipal school boards	1730.1958365956386
1046. correlatively can we reduce the	role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people	of the community or other school district and not that of the law court	5302.844890929269
1047. this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of	opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and	effect a plan of desegregation	2991.896482225019
1048. third how can we insure a systematic	and continuing group relations education in the schools	1650.3776838267252
1049. not	simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but	a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages	the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro	but as human beings	4141.090130875629
1050. again the problem is how to get it done and	in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it	should be done	3898.1264054757667
1051. fourth in the segregated school system during	the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity	1410.9272886447113
1052. in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good	many schools with all-negro population how can we assure equal opportunity	3478.9085380670003
1053. this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance	or by its existence	1250.3549035739118
1054. fifth in the segregated school system	or in the all-negro or all-white schools how can we encourage better	group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong	to the group	5341.767446819283
1055. can we help children adjust to images of other	children when the latter are not actually present	1407.8624834228776
1056. if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively	united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply	issue	since on the one hand school	desegregation	has come in virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall	we support the plan	6922.404739961321
1057. on the basis of pupil assignment criteria	judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white	schools in arlington and alexandria virginia	2325.701847115035
1058. shall we support pupil	assignment	22.112585741649077
1059. on the other hand looking at the larger picture	is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or	reduced school desegregation to a trickle	2853.3382537990487
1060. shall we therefore	oppose the plan	65.83876307917619
1061. this question is an issue because it likely divides	issue	no 2	640.0218309572923
1062. in large cities	like baltimore louisville and washington dc should school	desegregation be extended to all-negro and all-white schools by	assigning white and negro teachers respectively	4097.208293179136
1063. on the one hand	do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child	not be denied admission to a school on account of his race	2985.2554297922975
1064. or should	we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different	races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other	school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust	to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another	race	7394.783707994187
1065. we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation	impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated	issue no 3	1892.6680562034956
1066. the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that	resulted in desegregation	1647.9670744523123
1067. in each instance the plaintiff was a private	citizen	263.42709009502823
1068. in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire	state of mississippi no plaintiff has come forth	2119.8116276098867
1069. and i have established	that the action of municipal county or state school boards	or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison	with the number of districts	3095.270076679136
1070. is the requirement that the plaintiff be	a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement	2371.91961700946
1071. should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish	admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance	2477.037446001503
1072. even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision	for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we	nevertheless	support such a clause	4309.517011294803
1073. this is an issue for it divides	issue no 4	373.12836711730085
1074. withholding of funds to	schools	that deny children on account of race	952.6487284759969
1075. which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american	veterans committee	792.8148219440559
1076. should we support a clause in federal	school construction or school assistance legislation that would	deny federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a	child on account of his race	5335.7758787605035
1077. this is softer than earlier powell amendments	which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts	1412.2124316679303
1078. there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause	softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary	to the public schools	3916.6467008100526
1079. the federal funds limitation enlists the support	issue no 5	376.43100999840345
1080. state or county	or municipality be required to furnish public education	752.8159413084638
1081. for the	school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board	of supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and	the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white	or negro children	3775.231568293035
1082. is public education in this american democracy	of such importance that no child should be denied public education	2342.808804743118
1083. or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of states	rights or county rights	1260.2583690006209
1084. if people don't want to provide public	education should they be forced to do so	1646.0325769629121
1085. even if we marshal substantial	agreement behind mandatory public education we likely cannot	expect that all the states will enact the legislation	2170.397216517426
1086. should the	requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislated	by the united states congress	2118.1634660757104
1087. or must it become law by amendment	of the united states constitution	638.5524990750729
1088. we actually have two issues	issue no 6	252.4932253939309
1089. federal	responsibility	if the above issue is settled	by requiring public education for all citizens issue no 6 may	be moot	2030.1059271428762
1090. if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being	debated and resolved does the federal government have a responsibility	in situations like that in prince edward county	5171.6600152281535
1091. nearly	half the children still receive no education	166.6472478747473
1092. must or should the federal	government help	142.05093586239005
1093. should the government directly provide education	for the children who want public education	786.978231330063
1094. the next question is whether board members favor their own social	classes in their roles as educational policy-makers	2378.8479562778502
1095. on the whole	it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit	way	1577.2071280790683
1096. seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly	drawn	1179.3371035521218
1097. a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment	of a free public junior college in a community where there already	was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately	but was too expensive for working-class youth	4296.366653084939
1098. in situations	of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education	1412.5410040227348
1099. campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve	western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found little or no	relationship between certain social and economic factors and school	board competence as judged by a panel of professional educators who	studied the voting records on educational issues	4965.382309252722
1100. the few cases	of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not	to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who	favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay	increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational	policy	7411.577509747515
1101. in general it appears that trustees and board members	attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of	educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant	values of the society are middle-class values which are generally	thought	to be valid for the entire society	4953.183963159382
1102. there have been very few cases	of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any	other class in the field of educational policy	3885.3747054868763
1103. if there were more such	cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers	favor their own social classes	2186.8866712779245
1104. there is currently a major	controversy of public education in which group interests and values	are heavily engaged	2354.151961214675
1105. this is the issue of segregated schools in the	south	374.48350221266827
1106. in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial	groups rather than social-class groups	2121.5789969777325
1107. thus the white middle and	lower classes are arrayed against the negro middle and lower classes	1265.364816502221
1108. this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class	people better than it suits white lower-class people	3033.360005514541
1109. if this happens	there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards	and school teachers taking the middle-class position	2176.014395917182
1110. profession	the members of the educational profession have	a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position	being strongest in the universities	3694.4037427966387
1111. they are mostly upper-middle-	and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class	941.7229839142062
1112. do they	make class-biased decisions	22.24169819825139
1113. in a society dominated by middle-class	values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens	these social values it is clear that the educational profession	must work for the values which are characteristic of the society	3946.8674829203746
1114. there is no problem here	22.35142444513704
1115. the problem arises if it does arise when	the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his	professional competence but which bears some relation to the social	structure	3658.8589252353295
1116. for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations	for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously	or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class	4846.969970902653
1117. again	in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor	a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the	race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which	strengthens students in other ways	4403.262834080864
1118. the answers to questions	such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's	own social-class position and also upon his social history as well as	upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator	6464.382978058597
1119. in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class	backgrounds wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students	and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as	well as on his social-class background	3848.9855506152307
1120. one upward-mobile teacher may	be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to	develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while	another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with	lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations	at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment	8078.567065980099
1121. one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy	today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are	upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families	3451.2029690830523
1122. their own experience in the social system influences their work and	attitudes as teachers	1417.3377121433914
1123. while this influence is a complex matter depending	upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his	social-class experience there probably are some general statements about	social-class background and educational policy that can be made with	a fair degree of truth	4478.525057229765
1124. teachers who have been upward mobile	probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves	students as it has served them; that is they are likely to favor	a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value	6188.724082477391
1125. this does	not necessarily	mean that such teachers will favor vocational education	as contrasted with liberal education but they are likely to favor	an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement	value as against a kind of pure liberal education that	is not designed to help people get better jobs	5072.368199130772
1126. there is no doubt	that higher education since world war 2 has moved away from	pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and	specialization	3890.8962970869834
1127. there are several causes for this one being rapid economic	development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions	requiring engineering or scientific training	2179.4477786902607
1128. but another cause may	lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their	own use of education as a means of social advancement	4276.111796747711
1129. compared	with the college and university faculty members of the period from	1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children	of immigrants and more children	of urban working-class fathers	3560.2467973019093
1130. their experience is quite in contrast	with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born	parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own	sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum	6042.21602998347
1131. public interest groups	educational policies are formed by	several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in	the public interest	2179.104308732308
1132. legislators are one such group and state legislators	have major responsibility for educational legislation	1416.6081778421656
1133. they generally	vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency	should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might	be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests	in education	4138.178048114247
1134. however there are relatively few such political constituencies	and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction	between the educational interests of one social class and those	of another	5154.7561101932715
1135. another public interest group is the commission	of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem	and to make recommendations	2329.2201384400028
1136. generally these commissions work	earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive	it	2116.810419234513
1137. nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot	please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political	point of view	1884.2992231506985
1138. for instance there have been two presidential	commissions on higher education since world war 2	1644.9877064804682
1139. president	truman's commission on higher education tended to take a liberal	expansionist position while president eisenhower's committee	on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative	2859.3330244658805
1140. both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people	who attempted to act in the public interest	1886.7042605982012
1141. an example of a	more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the commission on	the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of	american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation	and the carnegie corporation	4033.341716155485
1142. this commission recommended against	the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities	and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships	3701.774018809635
1143. this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias	but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by	byron s hollingshead entitled who should go to college	3672.152341704064
1144. which recommended a federal government scholarship program	142.09258496641877
1145. furthermore	the commission set up the council for financial aid to education	as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support	of private higher education	2863.456693966003
1146. thus the commission acted with a	sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions	about the problem of government support to private education	4102.613465563951
1147. then	there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations	who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by	their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments	and demonstrations	3575.347618715902
1148. these people are practically always upper-	or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard	as the interest of the entire society	3692.8897839131496
1149. finally there are	the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the	national association of parents and teachers and the citizens committee	on public schools	2749.3810794592273
1150. these have an upper-middle-class leadership	and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working-class	parents are active in local p-ta matters	3040.514058405398
1151. like	the	other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational	attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest	as they see it	2868.3764972350505
1152. in general it appears that educational decisions	and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the	interests of the society as a whole	4299.11933978246
1153. they are predominantly middle-	and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes	of those classes	1410.8019674262564
1154. they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class	values and consequently fail to take them into account	2329.355982313778
1155. but there	is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one	social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education	3097.025565344039
1156. they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society	and try to serve the entire society	2124.396626908659
1157. structure through education	educational policy in the united states	has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural	opportunity	2049.7999881548913
1158. in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more	fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people	at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the	material	and cultural goods of society	6459.7404074105225
1159. on the other hand there is a counterbalancing	purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages	of the parents to their children	2459.3818249006704
1160. this leads to efforts at exclusiveness	through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification	in the schools	2598.390804702153
1161. both of these purposes exist side by side without much	overt conflict under present conditions	1092.6632588250302
1162. cultural opportunity	the broad expansion of free education results	both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society	and in promoting fluidity within the social structure	4655.283220185661
1163. fifty years	ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an	example of this movement	1566.0527826016316
1164. during the past decade the program has been	carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities	state colleges and community colleges	3682.4703322443174
1165. the reaffirmation of	american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the	conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of	maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity	3648.2833932815147
1166. the recent federal government's student-loan program is	another step in the direction of making higher education more available	to lower-status youth	3027.2604831116723
1167. it is probably more effective than the expanded	scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs	mainly aided the students with the best academic records	and these students tended to use the scholarship	funds to go to more expensive colleges	4412.15083478094
1168. meanwhile the private	colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised	an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds	3470.31713659517
1169. the gains	in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place	largely in the publicly supported institutions	1577.2628810489166
1170. unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the	following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory	as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal	costs in order to yield adequate revenues	6441.260486588948
1171. and this fact may explain	some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational	formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units	of service	3103.02983988027
1172. one such disagreement which will receive attention in	this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds	of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must	be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they	should be based instead on differences in marginal costs	7303.221384010549
1173. here	the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma	503.2148847952769
1174. of fully distributed cost analysis	despite	an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define relative costs	the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as	far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice	6344.814651368913
1175. for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types	of analyses	500.97442495876095
1176. by all means the most important distinction is that	between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution	of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental	or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no	difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution	6926.908131204073
1177. the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad	type because of its application to railroads	by the cost section of the interstate commerce	commission	2849.573069820478
1178. the cost section distinguishes between	variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding	chapter	2354.1356437949453
1179. the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units	of freight traffic as representing long-run out-of-pocket costs-	a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of	the economist's long-run marginal costs	3762.9157421060313
1180. there remains a residue	of total costs or total revenue requirements which since	it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations	in traffic density is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis	5774.306546116879
1181. nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make	some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this residue	which it sometimes calls burden among the units of carload	traffic on a basis which is concededly	quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination	4800.80181830545
1182. in recent	years this burden	has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements	which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to	meet	4647.07830409685
1183. since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad	rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff	of the interstate commerce commission has estimated out-of-pocket	costs and apportioned residue costs	3761.001754538697
1184. suffice it to say that the usefulness	of the latter apportionment is questionable	1180.9758923116442
1185. but in any event	full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and	overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost	analyses: namely that between a cost allocation designed to	reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates	of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment	which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service	even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint	of specific cost determination	0.20124717349522497
1186. we turn	now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the railroad	type draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost	apportionment: the single-step type	4486.628085010039
1187. it might be called the public	utility type because of the considerable use to which it has	been put in gas and electric utility rate cases	2730.4241407561376
1188. here no attempt is	made first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose	on these costs reasonably distributed residues of total	costs	3895.8153719710367
1189. instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs	although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be	functions of different variables	2855.100463596653
1190. moreover whereas in interstate commerce	commission parlance variable cost means a cost deemed to	vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output in the type	of analysis now under review variable cost has been used more	broadly so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable	are not necessarily	a linear function	8147.639214832115
1191. as already noted in an earlier	paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or	utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes	of service such as residential commercial industrial power street	lighting etc	4134.5187943288765
1192. this grand division permits many costs to be	assigned in their entirety to some one class such as street lighting	or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes	5355.501091099834
1193. high-tension industrial power service for example would not	be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of	the low-tension distribution lines	2587.264355469049
1194. but the major portions of the total	costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly	all classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned	among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among	the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve	as tentative measures of reasonable rates	8344.181540388981
1195. the general basis on	which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units	of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem	of an electric-utility cost analysis	3221.8753150207144
1196. but before turning to this	example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong	to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type	4273.074861637842
1197. in the first subtype the analyst	distributes both total operating	costs and total annual capital costs	among the different	classes and units of service	2466.7587182084385
1198. here an apportionment say of $5000000	of the total costs to residential service as a class would include	an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital	is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers	6813.0333417769525
1199. but in the second subtype which i take to be the one	more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost	of capital or fair return are apportioned directly among the	various classes of service	3958.872224852055
1200. to be sure the capital investments in	the plant and	equipment are apportioned among the different classes as are also the	gross revenues received from the sales of the different services	5043.349586976043
1201. but	any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service	over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a return	realized on the capital investment attributed to the same	service	3872.757997570312
1202. thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential	service are $7000000 if the operating expenses imputed	to this class of service come to $5000000 and if the net investment	in the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this	service amounts to $30000000 the cost analyst will report that residential	service in the aggregate has yielded a return of $2000000	or 6-23 per cent	8714.344673461554
1203. other services will show different rates of return	some probably much lower and some higher	1099.4900535433815
1204. there are obvious	reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding cost of capital	from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different	classes of service- notably the avoidance of the controversial question	what rate of return should be held to constitute cost of capital	or fair rate of return	7481.706757585637
1205. but the practice is likely to be	misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long	as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating	expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the	rates of charge for this service are compensatory	4886.609899033367
1206. needless to say any	such inference would be quite unwarranted	557.0915978815158
1207. for the reason just	suggested i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed	cost apportionment in the following simplified example	2457.0138399516495
1208. that	is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to	be included directly in the cost apportionment	3044.24343025588
1209. of the costs of an electric utility business	in order to simplify	the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us	assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company	supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation	plant	4689.023453230357
1210. let us also assume the existence of only one class or type	of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc	to residential commercial and industrial customers	5005.357739933964
1211. this latter	assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial	aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the distinction among	costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along	different dimensions	3939.879020589188
1212. since the company under review is supplying	what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might	suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very	simple; indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual	operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation	of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption	8794.237130822585
1213. in fact however the problem is not so simple	263.290219878222
1214. for a statement	of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these	costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output of	energy	3884.1968338669626
1215. a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required	262.98041535420026
1216. the simplest division and the one most frequently used	in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division	of the total operating and capital costs into customer costs	energy or volumetric costs and demand or capacity	costs	6083.078163996085
1217. if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart	in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does	have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one	class of service	4125.775357622229
1218. for example the monthly bill of a residential	consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge a $5 charge for 250	kilowatt-hours of energy at 2 per kilowatt-hour and a $2 charge for	a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1	per kilowatt- a total bill of $8 for that month	8177.47900965343
1219. but our present interest	lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly	in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs	2972.0754836983087
1220. let	us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing	that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative	1	3680.6857760838298
1221. the	these are those operating and capital costs found to	vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power	consumption	2167.773023020599
1222. included as a minimum are the costs of metering and	billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in	taking on another consumer	3894.2381368413176
1223. these minimum costs may come to $1 per month	more or less for residential and small commercial customers although	they are substantially higher for large industrial users who require	more costly connections and metering devices	3744.0084336533714
1224. while costs on this	order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial	rates in the form of a mere service charge they are more	frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles	the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further	payment	7639.973050021088
1225. but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost	imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice	of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked	as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial	fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary	distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated	annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity	5833.717244676791
1226. the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined	by the sociologist	757.0501538404504
1227. like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire	axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth	1407.9417591391543
1228. but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces	the idea of physical models	2127.227969400554
1229. is it not the task of philosophy	to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred	canons in social science	2330.9368418430704
1230. it has become painfully clear that the	very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by	erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response	to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation	6461.803684542475
1231. this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the	measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led	sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to	mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals	in such a group can be studied	5000.587237150473
1232. here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent	560.4715398418319
1233. the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs	to be questioned	934.3234045294382
1234. for if the small group notion involves the implicit	claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic	or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to	which such entities are valid	5649.122786938756
1235. the mere exploration of the unconscious	ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical	and logical investigation	1725.694672288567
1236. a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation	between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically	formed	2593.591790449679
1237. philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection	of socially viable categories	938.400925111395
1238. this involves a sifting of the	empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement	1876.9564891471389
1239. merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in	the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as nagel	and hempel indicate that the concept	of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological	models in which the notions of teleology ie metaphysical	purpose are central	5012.678907187598
1240. functionalism as	a sociological credo is therefore not a direct consequence of observations	but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference	and judgment	3491.3539038400254
1241. the purpose of this sort of philosophical study	of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social	science	2172.160999287077
1242. it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise	to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline	where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical	4482.665428657094
1243. such a position	entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic form as something	soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences	2328.7956568243058
1244. but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato	750.5246753404867
1245. the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to	any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism	2020.7342189283968
1246. however	when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the	conditions of empirical research	it becomes formal metaphysics; shaping	the contours of life to fit the needs of legends	4978.717345129795
1247. the notion of philosophy	as queen bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political	ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial	notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social	sciences	4199.24224865844
1248. metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with	nature as it was in antiquity	1411.380537021897
1249. it has surrendered any claims of description	in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's	system	1557.5604569416948
1250. science is mocked for wishing to know nothing	of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense	of men	3687.0373299675803
1251. it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality	by distinguishing between description and prescription	1264.1658005072882
1252. it is	simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during	this century	1654.48295477358
1253. consider the traditional four fields	of philosophy: logic ethics epistemology and esthetics	637.5430490891497
1254. it is a	commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic	hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological	criteria they move away from philosophy as such	5012.182593850655
1255. what is left	to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history	of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by	the canons of scientific method	3322.9663995718884
1256. in this situation philosophy has survived	by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate	questions to be the meaningless questions	3049.0529858393857
1257. the relinquishing	by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an	ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was	unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of	more humble sorts	4284.362519822991
1258. in the new situation philosophy is able to provide	the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers	the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used	in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value	6184.010909527337
1259. beyond	this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the	type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry	but within its potential domain of relevance	3317.000345336496
1260. in this connection	it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery	long before its uses in political science were exploited	3870.331622363688
1261. likewise	kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar	system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly	a half century before its scientific value was made plain by laplace	in his systeme du monde	4130.742599847607
1262. this does not mean that philosophy resolves	the problems it generates any more so than riemann's geometry	settled the physical status of the space-time continuum	3906.5706225680574
1263. but the forceful	presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself	a monumental task	1576.8111654085171
1264. to those raised on marcel's homo viator	and heidegger's das nichtige this may seem a modest	role for philosophy	2583.9180182049668
1265. however modesty and triviality are different qualities	93.74250469345439
1266. philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear	as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve	3048.960486122494
1267. the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind	has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a	more durable sort of drama	2462.8999082184237
1268. by clarifying fundamental premises in the	social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands	of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the	sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding	5765.912105559302
1269. philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful	and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis	or theory is framed	2608.65943528462
1270. the dissection of scientific theory the examination	of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology	and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less	so because of its removal from empirical research	5654.199294467687
1271. the realm	of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers	the range of prediction and explanation	1572.6594540018832
1272. whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist	logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is	something other than science	3455.7618132967364
1273. for some forms of philosophy this very	division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the	metaphysical superiority of the latter	2460.322377187921
1274. bergson and leroy announce	that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a	hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity	3503.181916028162
1275. this is simply a	confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous	788.7697404789168
1276. for	as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is important	but the removal of secrecy	2110.9189418387386
1277. in this philosophy and science	share a common goal	261.5836169750942
1278. the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees	that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall	not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this	division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between	mysticism and science	6452.764226918913
1279. the mystification of metaphysical systems	does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic	age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical	2856.815553742032
1280. the	tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private	intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific	and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict	over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology	6309.986068356514
1281. scientific systems and this includes even	the relation of mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined	and corrected	1725.39898250151
1282. philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness	are overthrown by rival systems	1411.4232708550023
1283. in addition to the incompleteness	of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ	in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited	forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive	3535.7510635567355
1284. the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject	to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against	the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the	sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable	than social behaviour	7008.3501575443615
1285. when dealing with the actual relation	of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy	in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has	to become necessarily selective	3660.8528581532432
1286. certain features we have touched upon:	philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science	methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of the assumptions	and presumptions of the social sciences; and philosophy as a	guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological	investigations	7018.31392609443
1287. the objection will be raised that the most important	role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted	namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in	the social sciences	3648.735070591054
1288. specifically it will be asked whether the real	questions people ask are not the ultimate questions that	social science finds itself impotent in the face of	4096.148374672391
1289. what then is the	status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence	or a means to an individual goal	2328.295975884378
1290. do societies develop according	to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals	2361.023271524514
1291. does society really exist as an entity over and above the	agglomeration of men	944.5707194182902
1292. i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical	insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either	empirical exploration or rational solutions	3900.172828527911
1293. as simmel and dilthey	indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual	or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to	appear as legitimate questions	3105.0433622155933
1294. such pseudo-questions assume that answers	of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving	undefined universals	1874.1889599186227
1295. social theory has no more right to expect results	from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a	theological solution to the wave-particle controversy	2742.8966511204094
1296. it is not	that such questions are not asked	389.07659108174005
1297. it is rather that introducing them	into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for	certainty	1883.7395034818262
1298. an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract	certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science	either replaces or reshapes	3691.139510140557
1299. to raise the added objection that	men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions	having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real	sense to undermine the objection itself	3561.2381418409095
1300. for what concerns all scientific	disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational	ie for the scientific determination of what in past ages	was considered ultimate and irrational	4989.842117686349
1301. a philosophy which attempts	to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence	in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative	solutions	2723.9202648662335
1302. men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension	of ultimate judgments where and when necessary	2364.7690123841003
1303. uncertainty	overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise	information about the world	1578.73379223005
1304. without such uncertainty we are left	with a set of dogmas and myths	1182.3873006417575
1305. the functional interplay of philosophy	and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to	myth-making	1420.1703040589196
1306. a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition	for the growth of science	1184.8904101323524
1307. but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality	like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard	2176.188872111622
1308. what were they to	do then with these awkward judgments of value	961.460018256591
1309. to find a place for	them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the	theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their	most important discovery	3445.288042903864
1310. it appeared that the theory could be saved	in one way only	969.8887427704269
1311. if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad	were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but	merely expressed emotions like hurrah or fiddlesticks	then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads	could be at rest	4688.72804729103
1312. this is the course the positivists took	141.1121557945376
1313. they	explained value judgments by explaining them away	167.02195532006857
1314. now i do not	think their view will do	394.4802885280987
1315. but before discussing it i should like	to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they	have stated their case	2591.730485017781
1316. it has been said of john stuart mill that	he wrote so clearly that he could be found out	2584.0393030905934
1317. this theory has been	put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind	and this i will do my best to supply	2730.1931775292187
1318. the theory claims to show	by analysis that when we say that is good we do not mean to assert	a character of the subject of which we are thinking	4814.665039658561
1319. i shall argue	that we do mean to do just that	503.13543695513397
1320. let us work through an example	and the simpler and commoner the better	1191.940164145373
1321. there is perhaps no value	statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement	that intense pain is bad	2035.262009231698
1322. let us take a set of circumstances	in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which	i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement	5320.813143492776
1323. we	come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in	common use	1566.6680563779084
1324. there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape	and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten	off its own leg	4815.145582813008
1325. the attempt failed: the animal is now dead	168.35828143009107
1326. as we	think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered we are	very	likely to say: it was a bad thing that the little animal should	suffer so	4977.408002161629
1327. the positivist tells us that when we say this we are	only expressing our present emotion	1255.1582185420334
1328. i hold on the contrary that we	mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad-	bad when and as it occurred	4073.1411004118127
1329. consider what follows from the	positivist view	94.60589251473985
1330. on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case	until i came on the scene and made my remark	3050.664017280663
1331. for what i express	in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course	did not exist until i did come on the scene	3199.692868828103
1332. the pain of the rabbit	was not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that pain was	being endured; badness in the only sense in which it is involved	at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt	6525.346802507798
1333. now	that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows	942.5991469374392
1334. let	us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene	and that the rabbit never was discovered	3253.8708094774797
1335. are we prepared to say that	in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did	2015.3215706130056
1336. clearly not	0.30041514999999996
1337. indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident	of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness	of the animal's pain that it would have been every whit as bad	whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel	repugnance or not	4898.784512628888
1338. if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering	was bad we are not expressing our feelings only	2813.153583691619
1339. we are saying that	the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an	attitude toward it	2033.1485901749656
1340. the first argument is thus an ideal experiment	in which we use the method of difference	1883.4349744394021
1341. it removes our present	expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected	by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be	2588.6234520031844
1342. the second argument	applies the method in the reverse way	560.018235053903
1343. it ideally removes the past	event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say	whereas on positivist grounds it should not	2601.101858062489
1344. let us suppose that the	animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but	that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering	was an evil thing	6013.95109291357
1345. on the positivist theory everything i sought	to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in	the second	2306.10081565327
1346. in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever	was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since	all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that	feeling is still there	6656.857762972804
1347. and our question is is such an implication	consistent with what we meant	791.0504017425935
1348. clearly it is not	4.406194923657415
1349. if anyone asked	us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether	we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident	had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should	say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were	asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred	back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to	be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken	0.20124717349522497
1350. the suggestion	that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making	no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about	the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous	5462.8553575118185
1351. if we did not mean	to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering	had not occurred	2175.4329861493297
1352. on the theory before us such relief would be	groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all	and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved	about	5438.023216018168
1353. the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition	377.83614664405184
1354. so far as i can see there is only one way out for	the positivist	1650.170781042218
1355. he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of	approval or disapproval	784.2040747909956
1356. and there is a way in which he might hold	that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval	without belonging to the pain itself	4444.429500843935
1357. the pain in itself was neutral;	but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward	this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the	first time and in the only intelligible sense bad	4218.455680039213
1358. this way of escape	is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of	its own and has not so far as i know been urged by positivists it	is perhaps best not to spend time over it	6053.25128970227
1359. i come now to a third	argument which again is very simple	644.4436889285901
1360. when we come upon the rabbit	and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably	make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly right in	saying that such remarks do usually express feeling	6053.835018965829
1361. but suppose that	a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement	again	1566.3799857459148
1362. and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that	the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded	3709.587379467808
1363. the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now	so	fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead	2740.8910316300876
1364. in	these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first	made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses	nothing	4110.004046511918
1365. it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when	there was no enthusiasm behind it	1414.703204381045
1366. and this seems to me untrue	64.18105114646701
1367. when	we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling	with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point	but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we	should certainly answer yes	4803.433045406214
1368. we should say that we made our point	with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time	but that it was the same point we were making	4978.28177703133
1369. and if we can see that	what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from	intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant	to express	3642.1452080531467
1370. i come now to a fourth consideration	141.2856594491635
1371. we all believe	that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting	and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would	not make sense	3465.6341069475566
1372. broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness	is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right	3486.162627963702
1373. but that is not exactly my point	93.22741359823036
1374. my point is this: whether there	is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we	express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do	5332.288895923509
1375. in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky	tells of his experiences in a siberian prison camp	1577.3093267674383
1376. whatever	the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today dostoevsky's companions	were about as grim a lot as can be imagined	3279.6776836196777
1377. i have heard	stories he writes of the most terrible the most unnatural actions	of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous	childishly merry laughter	2861.9421533869745
1378. most of us would say that in this delight	at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something	very unfitting	3680.940196345441
1379. if we were asked why we thought so we should say	that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take	delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting	3658.8595680455196
1380. now on the subjectivist	view this answer is ruled out	561.7955181569815
1381. for before someone takes	up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have	no moral quality at all	1873.7178678916903
1382. there is therefore nothing about them to which	an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting	2123.266818015748
1383. they are	in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they	get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker	3096.033174582629
1384. but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any	other	1409.2638059189328
1385. would applause for example be fitting if apart from the	applause there were nothing good to applaud	1416.2372142638487
1386. would condemnation be	fitting if independently of the condemnation there were nothing bad	to condemn	1650.8408231920275
1387. in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting	as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost	all point	2725.04148480394
1388. indeed we are forced to go much farther	250.33616098583593
1389. if goodness	and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being	by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry	laughter are taking the only sensible line	3552.715706017623
1390. if there is nothing evil	in these things if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling	about them why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer	4468.921559315419
1391. to greet	them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something	bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; and even	on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright	3567.3400883707873
1392. on the	other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral	into something good; it would bring goodness into the world	3897.3314482104493
1393. the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years	old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head	2323.6430503942584
1394. this	resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left	side of the cerebellum also	2597.187986156505
1395. in any event the extraordinary result	of this injury was that he became psychically blind while at	the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact	2978.153380004377
1396. psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence	of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one	is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture	of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence	7028.366206395175
1397. this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual	capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its	exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented	by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes	he had absolutely no spatial awareness	whatsoever	5002.5076673748035
1398. the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret	it would seem to be this:  spatial qualities are not among	those grasped by the sense of touch as such	4462.550067688489
1399. we do not arrive	at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself	1253.3519632375492
1400. spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual	representations; that is there is in the true sense only a visual	space	3895.093049691204
1401. the underlying assumption of course is that only	sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to	locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior	if not totally inadequate in this regard	4213.397286375916
1402. this is an assumption	with which few would be disposed to quarrel	961.0026350932915
1403. therefore if the sense	of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence	of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed	and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that	touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality	of things and that actual sight or visual representations are	necessary	5480.434806985835
1404. the force of the authors' analysis	can be felt by the reader i believe only after three	questions have been successfully answered	3267.3275490775522
1405. what allows us to think	that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his	eyes were closed	1412.853640749725
1406. what evidence is there that he was psychically	blind	389.00807973509166
1407. how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly	disturbed by his head injury	1569.0064068367426
1408. we shall consider these in the	inverse order of their presentation	753.8849737660086
1409. obviously a satisfactory	answer to the third question is imperative if the argument is to	get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether	the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital	lesion any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become	completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to	establish the desired conclusion	5691.331367620539
1410. the answer the authors give to it	therefore is of supreme importance	956.9089040087272
1411. it is as follows: the usual	sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness	as well as the kinesthetic	sensations	were	as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with	normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the entire body	4381.393988052302
1412. the	supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient	and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as	the direction and scope of a movement passively executed	proved to have been on the contrary very considerably	affected	6803.6696810121375
1413. the authors insist however that these abnormalities in	the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that	sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained	to the sense of sight	4028.9557627347376
1414. first of all what is their evidence	that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged	1403.2370340221662
1415. when	an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no difficulty determining	whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth	flexible soft or hard; and he could tell simply by the feel of	it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on	5067.764796678207
1416. and	he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately	before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and	could not be identified by him; that is he was unaware what kind	of objects they were or what their use was	6887.706144711621
1417. the patient attained	an astonishing efficiency in a new trade	374.6329868461415
1418. because of his brain injury	and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train	himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation	requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements	and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour	7526.594089540343
1419. it seems clear	when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight	of the patient	second question the one concerning the psychical blindness of the	that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the	usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably	more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal	vision	5673.415628334825
1420. and so the authors conclude: the conduct of the patient	in his every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing	facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt	that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected;	or to put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity	of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to	the tactual centers in the brain- that is from one end to the other-	was unimpaired	0.30166232349522504
1421. if the argument is accepted as essentially	sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the	patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating	objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective	visual condition	4613.243922403983
1422. but before we can do this we must first find	answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps	be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question	at hand	6042.494707637963
1423. in what ways then did the patient's psychical	blindness manifest itself	500.170047155499
1424. he could not see objects as unified	self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal	vision	2379.049861848147
1425. the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund	of visual memory-images of objects as objects; and therefore he could	not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again	3660.752624948259
1426. instead	he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused	some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so	on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question through	minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover	its contours	7399.701010200872
1427. according to his own testimony he never actually saw things	as shaped but only as generally amorphous blots of color of	a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty	much out of focus altogether	4023.531198434822
1428. but by the tracing procedure he could	in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form; could	piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole	and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned	out to be	7143.083908693156
1429. if however the figure to be discerned were complicated	composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing	process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple	shapes among its parts	3756.469637426191
1430. this meant concretely that the patient could	not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or	body became easily confused by hasher marks inserted between hand-written	words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and	could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing	it	7908.670097035538
1431. the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery	at all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate	him	2452.201870531989
1432. after a conversation with another man he was able to	recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe	at all what the other man looked like	4633.951024574291
1433. nor could he call up memory-pictures	of close friends or relatives	500.5348462195783
1434. in short both his own declarations	and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to	present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all	4648.145625035333
1435. he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely	because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned	and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do	3860.112178954928
1436. he could	not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he	had no visual memory at all	2582.7684946980794
1437. therefore his only recourse was to learn	the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same	individual object or type of object; and this he could do only by	going over its mass with the tracing procedure	4298.923325634943
1438. then he might finally	recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being	seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing	movements	4282.820709791151
1439. this would mean it can readily be seen that again	for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated	because of the absence of visual imagery	3191.1451769710925
1440. as one would	surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object	or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding	visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would	provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately	could determine by a kind of inference	8038.627895620593
1441. men trees automobiles	houses and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life-	had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable	at the very beginning of tracing by an inference as to what	each was	3851.519556607435
1442. dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface	963.6363477546614
1443. he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects	but their size and the dots gave them away	1881.1376953851964
1444. and the authors give	numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to	show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself	and how proficient he became at it	5449.752023377248
1445. often he seems even to have been	able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis	of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared	in his visual experience	3439.7997665792623
1446. perhaps the very important question-	what is then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the	patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing	movements when he is actually looking at things	5755.312399491399
1447. - has now been	raised in the reader's mind and in the following form	439.1218590317809
1448. if the patient	can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually	then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact	with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations	at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even	this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied	by the authors	8492.541953406722
1449. how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in	all this	373.8689272751789
1450. the authors set about answering this fundamental question	through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability tactually	to perceive figure and to locate objects in space with his	eyes closed	4814.646033972041
1451. quite naturally	they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from	making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing	the patient to move in any way he wanted to	3741.394521063891
1452. when the	patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following	striking results occurred	2811.4481739268767
1453. whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded	three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 bc they	tended to reflect reality; a schematic	abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the	late eighth century	4214.272180166088
1454. to speak of this underlying view of the	world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment	2116.253513472303
1455. at the least	however one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order;	their principles of composition stand very close to those which	appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line	3542.868179629034
1456. their world again	was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning	to appreciate the complexity of life	2819.953857774062
1457. and perhaps an observer of the	vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers	and users was basically stable and secure	2860.876695221711
1458. the storms of the past	had died away and the great upheaval which was to mark the following	century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds	4293.260726817169
1459. throughout	the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays	itself	940.4457407865979
1460. in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel	one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric	pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made	in the greek world	6053.4526011288135
1461. the ninth century was in its artistic work the	spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future	and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a	testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and	was appreciated	4603.9536777943085
1462. geometric pottery	has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it	deserves	partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some	of its local manifestations as at argos are only now coming to light	6089.622740985069
1463. from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the	historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress	of the aegean world down to 800 bc   the general intellectual	outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated	to a significant degree	4696.23127834515
1464. much which was in embryo in 1000	had become reasonably well developed by 800	1408.114974090268
1465. in this process the minoan-mycenaean	inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected;	the aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that	which	rises more clearly in our vision after 800	3468.9266006863204
1466. those modern scholars	who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean	development from earliest times- granted occasional irruptions of	peoples and ideas from outside- are correct; but all too many observers	have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change	which took place in the early first millennium	7951.388816061744
1467. the focus	of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of	the	greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always excepting	its northern shores had accepted the geometric style of pottery	3845.77387890827
1468. while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside greece	proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp these	non-greek	patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century	5004.499011659815
1469. in their place came local variations within the common style-	tentative as it were in protogeometric products but truly distinct	and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed	2991.754830918824
1470. attica	though important was not the only teacher of this age	754.5544833105439
1471. one can take	a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge of its place	of origin venture to assign it to a specific area; imitation and borrowing	of motifs now become ascertainable	3640.531821904574
1472. the potters of the aegean	islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece	itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric	sequences have each their own hallmarks	5022.356193585665
1473. these local variations were	to become ever sharper in the next century and a half	1096.9100858739744
1474. the same	conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark	ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early	social political and religious patterns into later ages	5169.171173770651
1475. by 800 bc	the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture	1091.5926290403727
1476. on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which	was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad	3878.1757644008453
1477. everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local	diversity; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized	and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors	2976.784752529132
1478. further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their	name	758.694435322702
1479. many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized	to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations	of this world support a lofty structure	2855.575281539769
1480. the epic poems the	consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political units	the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations	of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades	5810.289919801833
1481. what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and	yet the results however general are worth the search	2182.7027453290807
1482. these are	the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly	into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the	hellenic outlook independent of outside forces	5014.892278918976
1483. to interpret	indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation	may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed	information; if we could see more deeply we probably would find	many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the	period	5153.648371485725
1484. the historian can only point out those lines which were major	enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that	future excavations will enrich our understanding	4626.645652003854
1485. throughout the dark	ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but	consistently	1258.5916103460165
1486. the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants	of the aegean stood on firm ground	1888.1130384547257
1487. the landscape of greek history broadens widely and	rather abruptly in the eighth century bc the age of homer's	rosy-fingered dawn	2031.2377178204547
1488. the first slanting rays of the new day	cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world;	but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more	unmistakably some of the lines of change	6057.28606872911
1489. for this period as for earlier	centuries pottery remains the most secure source; the ceramic	material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative	of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of	human life and death	4620.21095918046
1490. figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence	of sculpture and architecture in greece; objects in gold	ivory	and bronze grow more numerous	3280.4781443066595
1491. since writing was practiced in the	aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of	tradition will now be occasionally useful	2734.4061358867934
1492. though it is not easy to	apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous	product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape	by 750	4836.885930247196
1493. the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad	are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek	civilization; but both were among the last products of a phase	which was ending	3437.304576241763
1494. greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution	in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were	suddenly to break forth	3252.227548609574
1495. the revolution was well under way before	700 bc and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century	1575.020842342899
1496. the era however is janus-faced	22.255014556896857
1497. while many tokens point forward	the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns	of the dark ages	1881.1667167869837
1498. the dominant pottery of the century was geometric;	political organization revolved about the basileis;	trade	was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the greek countryside	were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress	5774.02991258339
1499. the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely	to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth	century	2724.9994611484426
1500. not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis	751.0447835846371
1501. many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted	with radically new ideas; the poet of the iliad deliberately	archaized	2467.9008940108374
1502. although it is not possible to sunder old and new	in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the	first	decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee	of the first stage of greek civilization	6582.127927343751
1503. on this principle	of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture	society and politics; for the developments in these areas make sense	only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself	3763.7576102231906
1504. the growing	contacts between aegean and orient are also a phase which should	be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture	after 750	3903.262281040758
1505. we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections	to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic	and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece; the important	point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those	of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental	models	5142.514397175779
1506. the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in	the aegean past	1409.7690673430307
1507. the pottery of the first	half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric	1100.5050136083942
1508. the	severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the strong	geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery	of the principles underlying geometric pottery; but artists now were	ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance	6452.829462169183
1509. the vases which resulted	had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger	sense of style	1414.744655211429
1510. beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of	this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader	lines	2804.0515371068414
1511. in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding	a fundamental sense of order after chaos	1580.9344249690735
1512. they had had to work on very	simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses	2361.8464209856747
1513. the	potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate	motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a	belief that there was order in the universe	3089.9537823976066
1514. in their vases were embodied	the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization	at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently	in the initial stages of the geometric style	5163.985591886764
1515. by 800 social	and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane;	it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments	2731.4856378670083
1516. ripe	geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments	and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of	motifs which they had inherited	4472.0295988904845
1517. in these respects the vases of the early	eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress	1572.2327719461368
1518. to the ancestral lore however new materials were added	388.8868540518172
1519. painters	left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they	divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns	into which freehand drawing began to creep	3649.506601550516
1520. wavy lines feather-like	patterns rosettes of indefinitely floral nature birds either singly	or in stylized rows animals in solemn frieze bands-	all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary	signs that the potters were broadening their gaze	6323.101688474539
1521. the rows of animals	and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes	transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles but the	specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are	nonetheless greek	4031.037515792023
1522. though the spread of this type of decoration in the	aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first	in the cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery	throughout the century	5760.08373156961
1523. as the material at the command of the	potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local	variations within a common style became more evident	2867.526054938044
1524. plate 12 illustrates	four examples which are ripe or late geometric work of common	spirit but of different schools	2592.8325584692366
1525. cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and	when he could not show the hide arrested him	2184.9633749656928
1526. thinking the evidence	insufficient to get a conviction he later released him	958.0611297845757
1527. even while suffering	the trip to his home cook swore to moore and lane that he	would kill the indian	1886.6664696115536
1528. three weeks later following his recovery	armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared	by the district attorney cook and russell rode to arrest martinez	4652.0046166745615
1529. arriving at daybreak they found julio in his corral and demanded	that he surrender	936.5706599253654
1530. instead he whirled and ran to his house for	a gun forcing them to kill him cook reported	2363.375768684013
1531. both cook's	and russell's lives were threatened by the mexicans following the	killing but the company officers felt that in the end it would serve	to quiet them despite their immediate emotion	3430.2179638445828
1532. general manager pels	even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense	rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try	to have a few punished	5442.305079608015
1533. on february 17 russell and cook	were sent to the pena flor community on the vermejo to see about renting	out ranches the company had purchased	2736.2890760483056
1534. while talking with julian	m beall francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared both	heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away	3910.9994325091066
1535. it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and	began riding down the stream	1425.2589940179382
1536. they had traveled only a short distance	when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across	the stream just ahead of them	3486.076736884103
1537. suspecting an ambush the two deputies	decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill	1731.6398204970585
1538. after spending two nights in catskill	the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business	2115.3011530299686
1539. they stayed with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock	saturday morning passed the old garnett lee ranch	1744.159530013243
1540. half a mile below	at the mouth of salyer's canyon was an old ranch that the company	had purchased from a j armstrong occupied by a mexican	his wife and an old trapper	5359.811208709112
1541. there were three houses in salyer's	canyon just at the foot of a low bluff the road winding along the top	entering above and then passing down in front of the houses thence	to the vermejo	3860.9233530798365
1542. to the west of this road was another low bluff forty	or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush	3253.5025058727147
1543. as they	were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the	two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers	2997.351037986277
1544. not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush but one	hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through	his body	4266.948957927172
1545. with the first reports russell's horse wheeled	to the right and ran towards the buildings while cook followed by a	hail of bullets raced towards the arroyo of salyer's canyon immediately	in front of him just reaching it as his horse fell	4390.893988805338
1546. grabbing	his winchester from its sheath cook prepared to fight from behind	the arroyo bank	1642.9624483358741
1547. bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that	he found it difficult to return the fire	1564.69521389559
1548. noticing russell's horse	in front of the long log building he assumed his friend had slipped	inside and would be able to put up a good fight so he began working	his way down the ditch to join him	6190.146573284579
1549. at a very shallow place two mexicans	rushed into the open for a shot	949.2968401050557
1550. dropping to one knee cook	felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further	fire in his direction	3291.13691444113
1551. just before leaving the arroyo where he	was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house	1577.381757606438
1552. russell had reached the house as cook surmised dismounted but just	as the old trapper opened the door to receive him he fell into the trapper's	arms- dead	4500.34120028951
1553. a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding	in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole	two-inches square on the outgoing side	2987.1969651215104
1554. finding him dead cook caught	russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report	the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins	3904.787531028681
1555. before daylight sunday morning a posse of twenty-three men under	the leadership of deputy sheriff frank macpherson of catskill followed	the trail to the house of francisco chaves where 100 to 150	mexicans had gathered	3757.7626413548146
1556. macpherson boldly approached the fortified	adobe house and demanded entrance	563.3038829618632
1557. the men inside informed him that they	had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see	them even though he offered medical aid	2986.769798422753
1558. the officer demanded the names	of the injured men; the mexicans not only refused to give them	but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it	4816.304477344337
1559. since	the strength of the mexicans had been underrated too small a posse	had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with	search warrants macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to	withdraw	4055.115076004815
1560. the posse's retreat encouraged the mexicans to	be overbearing and impudent	752.1956835309078
1561. during the following week six tons of hay	belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings farm tools	two horses plows and hay owned by bonito lavato a friendly interpreter	for the company and pedro chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed;	and a store was broken into and robbed	4916.769003953053
1562. district attorney m	w mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught	committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch	anyone	3718.1196783349624
1563. increasing threats on his life finally convinced cook	that he should leave new mexico	938.6211209187261
1564. his friends advised that it would	be only a question of time until either the mexicans killed him by	ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense perpetuating	the troubles	5312.1854407433
1565. by early summer he wrote from laramie that he	was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad	way financially so pels sent him a draft for $100 warning that it	was still not wise for him to return	4521.614869871746
1566. pels also sent a check for $100	to russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his	grave	2826.9524937740216
1567. cattle stealing and killing again serious during the	spring of 1891 placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing	position	2025.424280025464
1568. they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property	thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on	the vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary	for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot	6818.459342239005
1569. and	the law virtually ignored the situation	93.65229435293088
1570. the judge became ill just as	the colfax district court convened no substitute was brought in	no criminal cases heard only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried	and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual	three weeks	6888.066952166769
1571. pels complained: litigants and witnesses were	put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact	business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished	and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to	be an absolute farce	4287.353625860442
1572. word reached the company that the man	behind these depredations was manuel gonzales a man with many followers	including a number who were kept in line through fear of him	4805.771029959001
1573. although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones	the warrant for his arrest had never been served	2189.053821062254
1574. on may 19 a	deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left maxwell city and rode thirty-five	miles up the vermejo where they were joined by juan jose	martinez	4481.54997449912
1575. by 3:00 am they reached his house and found it vacant	500.0771635484754
1576. when they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby	they smashed down the door broke the window and threw lighted clothes	wet with kerosene into the room	4494.170983271994
1577. still there was no gonzales and	the family would say nothing	504.13161418888683
1578. about 300 yards up the creek was	a cluster of mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a	square	3047.37166185655
1579. while prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized	the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside	1724.720811183018
1580. he was promised	that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed	and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door	4661.2540585819
1581. the	posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building	would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him	dead or alive	3465.938441808251
1582. in deadly earnest the besiegers methodically	stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags	inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit	the floor	5320.627574106895
1583. when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer	taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside square against	the muzzle of a winchester	2860.3435352960473
1584. shot near the heart he turned to	one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three	bullets following him	3693.636184029417
1585. as he pushed open the door he fell on his	face one of his comrades pulling him inside	1571.998661855721
1586. not realizing the	seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender	the house would be burned down around him	3695.5581136178926
1587. receiving no answer	they set the fire	93.5639864414304
1588. when the house was about half consumed his comrade	ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that	he did not know the whereabouts of manuel	4638.80702599054
1589. finding it true that he	was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes	through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed	covered by a blanket	3942.7801329923955
1590. several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside	the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand	1882.2147780519304
1591. shot six or eight	times the body was draped with russell's pistol belt and cartridges	1107.3351207698809
1592. there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though	numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby	without firing a shot during the entire attack	5312.2878469192265
1593. early the next	morning a mexican telephoned pels that celso chavez one of the	posse members was surrounded by ten mexicans at his father's home	on the upper vermejo	3108.8466928208477
1594. the sheriff and district attorney mills	hastily swore	out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed	according to signed statements by chavez and dr i p george	and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman	6665.00185188582
1595. traveling all night clark and twelve men arrived at about seven	o'clock may 22	940.6788539068717
1596. occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a	number of horsemen were sighted on the hills disappearing at the posse's	approach	2835.7522654372883
1597. a mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against	chavez for taking part in the murder of manuel gonzales	so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger	3650.2040030524645
1598. the men	helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along	with three other families desiring to leave	2799.784861323758
1599. the ten or more	dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and	pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe	houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult	to capture them	4122.786976219189
1600. thus he wired j p lower and sons of	denver: have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a	house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot	5008.921157910271
1601. if not	how long to order and what is the price	501.6613924250328
1602. he wisely decided that	it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup	particularly since the mexicans were on their guard	3687.265241005766
1603. his problem	then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean	out the vermejo by force immediately	1880.9485683349817
1604. the plant was located west of the battenkill and south of the location	of the former electric light plant	2604.06698765749
1605. the manchester depot	sewer company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction	of a sewer in that locality and assessments were made for its maintenance	2968.1466471282097
1606. it has given considerable trouble at times and empties right	into the battenkill	1181.1419089371032
1607. fire district no 1 discussed its possible	purchase in 1945 but considered it an unwise investment	1247.8058063001536
1608. the	sewer on bonnet street was constructed when there were only a few houses	on the street	2123.235386864525
1609. as new homes were built they were connected so that	all residences south of school street are served by it	1866.215591052786
1610. b j	connell is the present treasurer and manager	392.626439090632
1611. the 1946 town	meeting voted to have the selectmen appoint a committee to investigate	and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and	a disposal plant to serve manchester center depot and way's	lane	3963.655374771235
1612. the committee submitted a report signed by louis martin and	leon wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report	3037.3743323540166
1613. the layout	of the sewer lines was designed by henry w taylor who was the	engineer for the manchester village disposal plant	2182.0276267579966
1614. no figures were	submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town	2115.8610606408647
1615. the 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal	and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed	sewage plant with its attendant facilities	3121.622080032392
1616. the final step was a	vote	for a $230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by	the 1959 town meeting later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special	town meeting june 21 1960	5938.584461312725
1617. there the matter stands with	the prospect that soon manchester may be removed from the roster of	towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams	2586.4997444306077
1618. telegraph	manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has	often been attributed to the fact that the rev j d wickham	headmaster of burr and burton seminary was a personal friend and	correspondent of the inventor samuel f b morse	6066.415769883211
1619. at any	rate manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system	which was set up in 1844 between baltimore and washington	2307.8064202440846
1620. in	1846 matthew b goodwin jeweler and watchmaker became the town's	first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business	two doors north of the equinox house or one door north	of the bank manchester vermont	6193.237755601035
1621. goodwin was telegrapher for	the american telegraph company and the troy and canada	junction telegraph company	1257.8916108839105
1622. shares of capital stock at $15 each	in the latter company were payable at the bank of manchester or at	various other vermont banks	3675.7551972913693

1624. by 1871 l c orvis	manager of the western union telegraph company expressed	willingness to send emergency telegrams on sundays from his village	drugstore	3707.2135943949097
1625. orvis even needed to hire an assistant clark j wait	373.40816886736246
1626. the manchester journal commented editorially on the surprising	amount of local telegraphic business	1180.6449995756138
1627. in the fall of 1878	the popular telegraph line was established between manchester	and factory point by the owners paul w orvis henry gray	j n hard and clark j wait	3339.3485710801033
1628. the line soon lived up	to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a	dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends	on its capital stock	5625.843310096293
1629. in 1879 the same clark wait with h	h holley of south dorset formed the american telegraph	line extending from manchester depot via factory point and	south dorset to dorset	3234.127584151268
1630. besides being most convenient the line soon	proved a good investment for the owners	1412.09195219794
1631. telegraphers at the	depot at this time were aaron c burr and mark manley of burr	and manley dealers in lumber and dry goods	2471.4404537618093
1632. early equipment	was very flimsy; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles	making communications impossible	1652.7712734499844
1633. but companies continued to spring	up	43.26152512179776
1634. by 1883 the battenkill telegraph company was in existence	and alvin pettibone was its president	1633.102802290661
1635. operating in 1887 was the	valley telegraph line officers of which were e c orvis	president; h k fowler vice-president and secretary;	j n hard treasurer; f h walker superintendent;	h s walker assistant superintendent	3752.0070897108344
1636. two companies now had	headquarters with clark j wait who by then had his own drugstore	at factory point- the northern union telegraph company	and the western union	4493.672895202984
1637. operators were arthur koop and	norman	taylor	94.26903642469895
1638. still existing on a northern union telegraph form	is a typical peremptory message from peru grocer j j hapgood	to burton and graves' store in manchester- get and send	by stage sure four pounds best porterhouse or serloin stake for mrs	hapgood send six sweet oranges	7070.474801475318
1639. about 1888 j e	mcnaughton of barnumville and e g bacon became proprietors	of the green mountain telegraph company connecting all offices	on the western union line and extending over the mountain from	barnumville to peru londonderry south londonderry lowell lake	windham north windham grafton cambridgeport saxton's	river and bellows falls	5011.958984413855
1640. from 1896 until 1910 john h	whipple was manager of western union at the center in the drugstore	he purchased from clark wait	3495.1572902598236
1641. the village office of western union	with george towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in hard's	drugstore until 1905	1731.3187762479392
1642. during the summers towsley often needed	the assistance of a company operator	964.3209286181049
1643. these were the years when	people flocked to manchester not only to play golf which had come	into vogue but also to witness the ekwanok country club tournaments	2982.0122328504144
1644. new yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed	fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers	3039.0803602898245
1645. this boosted local telegraph business and manchester basked in	all the free advertising	792.7073193316398
1646. in 1914 when the town was chosen for the	u s amateur golf tournament a representative hurried here from	the boston manager's office	3506.97357187217
1647. in his wake came the district traffic	supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession ten of	boston's best chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge	of golf	3105.866850094534
1648. during that tournament alone some 250000 words winged	their way out of manchester	1186.6761927320936
1649. the old morse system was replaced	locally by the simplex modern automatic method in 1929 when ellamae	heckman was manager of the western union office	2597.3471578854546
1650. during	summers business was so brisk that mrs wilcox had two assistants	and a messenger	1653.8804863210014
1651. she was succeeded by clarence goyette	43.00948567354885
1652. since	that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad	station at the depot and shops at the center back to the town clerk's	office and drugstore at the village	5371.8707280529325
1653. after being located for	some years in the village at the equinox pharmacy under the supervision	of mrs harry mercier it is presently located in the hill	and dale shop manchester center	3453.6537643969555
1654. the first known telephone	line in manchester was established in july 1883 between burr and	manley's store at manchester depot and the kent and root marble	company in south dorset	4836.377187344809
1655. this was extended the following year	to include the railroad station agent's office and thayer's hotel	at factory point	1731.8689348621767
1656. in november 1887 a line connecting several dwelling	houses in dorset was extended to manchester depot	1880.7386247533068
1657. telephone	wires from louis dufresne's house in east manchester to the dufresne	lumber job near bourn pond were up about 1895	2031.0401463723545
1658. eber l taylor	of manchester depot recorded the setting of phone poles in east	dorset and barnumville in his diary for 1906	3245.0597079547288
1659. these must have been	for local calls strictly as in may 1900 the only long distance	telephone in town was transferred from c b carleton's to	young's shoe store	3103.689073497812
1660. a small single switchboard was installed	in the village over woodcock's hardware store		652.1430061138627
1661. george woodcock was manager and troubleshooter;	elizabeth way was the first operator; and a night operator was also	employed	1730.3903385246326
1662. anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones	advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the manchester	journal	3260.7316543078387
1663. in 1918 the new england telephone company	began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of u	s rte 7 and what is now memorial avenue at manchester center	3444.782894283669
1664. service running through barnumville and to bennington county	towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the gleason telephone	company in 1925 but major supervision of telephone lines	in manchester was with the new england telephone and telegraph company	which eventually gained all control	6991.299403208422
1665. more aerial and underground	equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care	of the expanding business	1728.6634530838826
1666. in 1931 mrs f h briggs	agent and chief operator who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years'	service led agency offices in sales for the year with $2490	4805.488593117746
1667. william hitchcock who retired in 1938 was a veteran of thirty-four	years' local service	936.9235433008414
1668. another veteran telephone operator was edith	fleming blackmer who had been in the office forty years at the time	of her death in 1960	3668.9683864950835
1669. in 1932 dorset received its own exchange	which made business easier for the manchester office but it was	not until february 1953 that area service was extended to include manchester	and dorset	3444.370550765479
1670. this eliminated toll calls between the two towns	249.690318926693
1671. within a month calls were up seventy per cent	258.91019027958987
1672. power	electricity plays such an important part in community life	today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not	available for daily use	4240.650532531915
1673. yet one has to go back only some sixty years	379.51113901537235
1674. the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seems	to be one installed in reuben colvin's and houghton's gristmill	on the west branch in factory point	4280.988989813053
1675. no records are available as	to the date or extent of installation but it may have been in 1896	1720.022935306773
1676. on june 14 1900 the manchester journal reported that	an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for edward	s isham at ormsby hill	3913.4439404003233
1677. this was working by the end	of august and giving satisfactory service	640.8357172897714
1678. in november 1900	surveying was done under john marsden on the east mountains to ascertain	if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate	an electric power plant	5184.282281773887
1679. nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of	opportunity for water storage	780.5805375221524
1680. the next step was construction	by the manchester light and power company of a plant on the west	bank of the battenkill south of union street bridge	4311.312373467126
1681. this was nearly	completed may 23 1901 with a promise of lights by june 10 but	the first light did not go on until september 28	2726.5016616870885
1682. it was at the end	of the sidewalk in front of the dellwood cemetery cottage	1647.739398656006
1683. the	first directors of the manchester light and power company were	john marsden m l manley william f orvis george smith	and john blackmer	2478.429454812841
1684. the officers were john marsden president;	john c blackmer vice-president; george smith treasurer;	and william f orvis secretary	2369.258873687312
1685. marsden was manager of the	company for ten years and manager of its successor company the colonial	light and power company for one year	2459.6513912928
1686. at about the time	the marsden enterprise was getting under way the vail light and	lumber company started construction of a chair stock factory on the	site of the present bennington co-operative creamery intending to	use its surplus power for generating electricity	6563.433089143783
1687. manchester then had	two competing power companies until 1904 when the manchester light	and power company purchased the transmission system of the vail	company	2471.5245561324004
1688. this was fortunate as the vail plant burned in 1905	566.7929328520092
1689. the colonial light and power company was succeeded by the vermont	hydro-electric corporation which in turn was absorbed by the	central vermont public service corporation	2576.61453487179
1690. the latter now furnishes	the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at	manchester depot which was put into operation february 19 1930 and	was improved in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformers	5776.086324780647
1691. for a time following the abandonment of the local plant	electric current for manchester was brought in from the south with	an emergency tie-in with the vermont marble company system to the north	3555.1229310964763
1692. some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned	diversion of a learned world a phantasy with which more amused	himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual	high spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention	6610.630803173735
1693. with	respect to this view two points are worth making	376.6180824334773
1694. first it appears	to be based on the fact that on its title page utopia is described	as festivus gay	2814.7648431079006
1695. it overlooks the other fact that	it is described as nec minus salutaris quam festivus no	less salutary than gay	1882.0723976341349
1696. it also overlooks the fact that in a rational	lexicon and quite clearly in more's lexicon the opposite of	serious is not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious	but solemn	5614.461717687577
1697. more believed that a man could be both serious and gay	504.55337502294503
1698. that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional	illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly	believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because	they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode	of expression their authors are capable of	7595.536075951563
1699. secondly to find a learned	diversion and a pleasing joke in more's account of the stupid	brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the anguish of the poor	and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful	requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising	in a moral imbecile and most surprising in more himself	5583.805406158624
1700. indeed	it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and regius	professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most peculiar	view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance	english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent	proponent	6895.579572440821
1701. but to return to the main line of our inquiry	372.5160235461402
1702. it	is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval	or even because he was a martyr- indeed it is likely that these	days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that	its author was a martyr	6687.338273036041
1703. utopia is still widely read because in	a sense more stood on the margin of modernity	1259.944138459408
1704. and if he did stand	on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity	as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom	4980.928795256387
1705. it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or	in translating lucian from greek into latin or in defending the study	of greek against the attack of conservative academics or in attacking	the conservative theologians who opposed erasmus's philological	study of the new testament	4749.608201391499
1706. similar literary exercises were the	common doings of a christian humanist of the first two decades of the	sixteenth century	2832.3014170132697
1707. had more's writings been wholly limited to such	exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen	or so other authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive	in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit	of their very specialized occasions read those works	5197.627665166948
1708. more	stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he	wrote utopia	1647.354769912138
1709. and the evidence that he does indeed stand there	derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual	readers have responded to that book for the past century or so	3452.945027301027
1710. only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and direct	a response and only one other contemporary work- niccolo machiavelli	and the prince	3709.0034998851743
1711. can we discover what it is in utopia	that has evoked this response	783.234066306365
1712. remember that in seeking the modern	in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance	there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing	on the same inconceivable	scale the relative importance of the medieval the	renaissance and the modern	7133.212154472838
1713. the medieval was the most important	to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of	utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more	the martyr	3117.3310296995437
1714. to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance	of christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary	concern	2830.632146146486
1715. but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want	to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want	to know what is perennially new about utopia	3549.5085673048043
1716. what is new	about it	22.238341279360153
1717. to that question the answer is simple; it can be made	in two words utopian communism	1259.8124634858473
1718. but it is an answer which opens the	door wide to an onrush of objections and denials	2111.8684023336873
1719. surely there is nothing	new about communism	93.8330370390386
1720. we find it in plato's republic and	in utopia more acknowledges his debt to that book	1887.882297318813
1721. we find it	in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h still in	use among the truest societies of christians that is the better	monasteries which made it easier to convert the utopians to	christianity	4113.264067904149
1722. we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition	which included the community of all possessions	2567.2137442453613
1723. this conception	was taken up by the early church fathers and by canon lawyers and	theologians in the middle ages; and more was far too well read not	to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it	4454.750035962383
1724. but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's	day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it	is not communism as such that we are concerned with	5469.822740313076
1725. we are concerned	not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus:	platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological	communism; we are concerned with utopian communism- that is simply	communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia	as more conceived it	4763.482279702603
1726. perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity	of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier	types of communistic theory	3909.604781852341
1727. we will achieve a more vivid sense	of what it is by realizing what it is not	1409.9614668409654
1728. in plato's republic	communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of janissaries	960.0062093410646
1729. its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among	whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite	1737.4696663352129
1730. moreover	it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what	gave	the initial impetus to plato's excursus into the construction of an	imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods wives	and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of	the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the republic	ultimately returns	8261.899235136709
1731. in more's utopia communism is not	a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass	1580.8898348402784
1732. utopian	communism applies to all utopians	64.92258633129819
1733. and in the economy of the	book it is not peripheral but central	790.2108160179642
1734. the concern of utopia is	with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society;	and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism	provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering	5941.368284131493
1735. to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community	of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit	the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives	misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic:	in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical	and intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with	an elite of spiritual and religious athletes	0.20124717349522497
1736. the apostolic community	was literally an elite: chosen by christ himself	753.0892142122259
1737. and the monastic	communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only	after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic	rigors their spiritual athleticism	3104.0588705564633
1738. finally the conception	of the natural community of all possessions which originated	with the stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by more's time although	it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the	middle ages	5885.735096579783
1739. in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in	the age of innocence before the fall of man	1725.7261898086167
1740. it did not serve to	contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order	because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man	had sinned	4825.668159674941
1741. the actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic	communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a	millenium before more wrote utopia	1889.262282903328
1742. the soil is common	to all men h	249.33469532425497
1743. when we give the necessities of life to the poor	we restore to them what is already theirs	1560.276412051775
1744. we should think of it more	as an act of justice than compassion	1182.2339991319752
1745. because community not	severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely	unalterable right to what is his	2321.0962086807003
1746. indeed of all that is his every	man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated	to regard himself as a custodian	3700.362759279581
1747. he is a trustee for the common good	however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of	property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund	wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping	4012.529698804902
1748. in contrast to this	stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the nature of man is such	that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of	municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness	in a sieve	6425.805350222881
1749. the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions	93.70851488057397
1750. in	a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the	function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to	a small voice so often still	4839.975495725291
1751. in all the respects just	indicated	utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community	of possessions and living plays a role	2180.6344778549956
1752. neither from one of these	conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced	1881.9999251366658
1753. we do	not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found the	tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks	2587.6784518537725
1754. in	a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may	find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole original-	a new thing	4291.941596746561
1755. it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very	few new things in utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist	or part of an old tradition of social criticism	3767.8149616108653
1756. but to say that	at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say	that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes	within the five years following the publication of utopia when	martin luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the divine's	encounter with man	7766.165000206527
1757. new indeed is luther's perception but	not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible	to modern students what luther was getting at	2707.425923175251
1758. although utopian	communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism	or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in	theory or in practice	5198.608217383581
1759. consider the features of utopian communism:	generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections	of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common	refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens;	even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor	a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures	to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property no money;	no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore	no market in the economic sense of the term	0.20124717349522497
1760. whatever the merits of	its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit	any modern socialist or communist	3267.4724843912154
1761. it is not the details of utopian	communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude	of mind that informs those details	2453.521061328336
1762. what that spirit and attitude	were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts	with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the	one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the	church fathers of late antiquity	6805.904211851064
1763. during the dorr trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings	and heralded dorr as a martyr to the principles of the declaration	of independence	2480.200210728801
1764. during the brown trial however the state's	most powerful democratic newspaper the providence daily post	stated that brown was a murderer a man of blood and that he and	his associates with the assistance of republicans and abolitionists	had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow	of state and federal governments	7966.453276046862
1765. the providence daily journal	answered the daily post by stating that the raid of john	brown was characteristic of democratic acts of violence and that he	was acting in direct opposition to the republican party who proclaim	as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere	with slavery in the states	5109.663429321901
1766. the two major newspapers in providence	continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting	the facts and attempting to falsify history	3482.400152581704
1767. while the	daily post continued to accuse republicans and the daily journal	continued to accuse democrats the woonsocket patriot complained	that the virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly	haste to condemn brown and his men	3774.903124455364
1768. editor foss stated of their	guilt h there can be no doubt h but they are entitled to sufficient	time to prepare for trial and h a fair trial	4648.914313729578
1769. the providence	daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for	the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing	gained by a delay would be calmer feelings	3650.2506228433426
1770. the providence daily	journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident the	south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace	3892.937564298546
1771. on october 31 1859 john brown was found guilty of treason	against the state of virginia inciting slave rebellion and murder	2031.401162836067
1772. for these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on friday	december 2 1859	1890.096497758821
1773. upon receiving the news northern writers editors	and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the southern states	particularly virginia	1726.9471619595872
1774. although rhode islanders were preparing	for the state elections they watched john brown's trial with	extreme interest	2134.7193934631487
1775. on wednesday morning november 2 1859 the providence	daily journal stated that although brown justly deserved	the extreme penalty no man however criminal ought to suffer the penalty	without a fairer trial	3437.3201268311336
1776. the editor's main criticism of the trial	was the haste with which it was conducted	1640.0839730028213
1777. the readers of the providence	daily post however learned that it was generally conceded	that old brown had a fair trial	2027.3648098406818
1778. concerning the sentence	the editor asked what else can virginia do than to hang the men	who have	defied her laws organized treason and butchered her citizens	4267.877785536711
1779. in the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction	to brown's trial and sentence were basically identical	1568.2749961589068
1780. j	wheaton smith editor of the warren telegraph stated that the	ends of justice must be satisfied a solitary example must be set	in order that all those misnamed philantropists sic who actuated	by a blind zeal dare to instigate riot treason and murder may	heed it and shape their future course accordingly	7658.988073790305
1781. the editor of	the newport advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating	circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception	to the infliction of capital punishment	3106.0280032929813
1782. in direct contrast	to the other rhode island editors samuel s foss of the woonsocket	patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely	unfair	3708.422227446956
1783. concerning the sentence foss wrote if it be possible	h that mercy shall override vengeance h and that john brown's	sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment it would be well- well	for the country h and for virginia	4038.2665215932293
1784. despite the excitement	being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown rhode islanders	turned their attention to the state elections	3272.760158648066
1785. the state had	elected republican candidates in the past two years	504.11081518459275
1786. there was no doubt	as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the	state	1652.5714016405568
1787. if it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state	offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant	of the know-nothing party which called itself the american republican	party	3648.9770481907954
1788. the american republicans and the republicans both nominated	lieutenant-governor turner for governor	972.774010066352
1789. elisha r potter	was the democratic candidate	93.91673773857357
1790. the results of the election of 1859	found republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor	and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two congressional offices	from the eastern and western sections of the state	5653.621472299665
1791. during	the month of november hardly a day passed when there was not some mention	of john brown in the rhode island newspapers	2310.582256106819
1792. on november	7 1859 the providence daily journal reprinted a letter sent	to john brown from e b a quaker lady in newport	3489.595394598099
1793. in	reference to brown's raid she wrote though we are non-resistants	and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal	weapons h we know thee was anemated sic by the most generous	and philanthropic motives	4138.244627959121
1794. e b compared john brown	to moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from	oppression	2345.090094766319
1795. in contrast to e b most rhode islanders	hardly thought of john brown as being another moses	1410.4033928314116
1796. most attempts	to develop any sympathy for brown and his actions found an unresponsive	audience in rhode island	2365.7902633234585
1797. on wednesday evening november	23 1859 in warren rev mark trafton of new bedford gave	a mission of sympathy lecture in which he favorably viewed the	harper's ferry insurrection	3097.762843648604
1798. the warren telegraph stated	that many of rev trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored	strongly of radicalism and fanaticism	2589.8283599446277
1799. in its account of the trafton	lecture the providence daily post said that the remarks	of	rev trafton made the people indignant	2175.199854316991
1800. no sympathy or admiration	for brown could be found in the providence daily post	for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison	who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy	6016.056976609315
1801. the providence	daily journal however stated that brown's courage bravery	and heroism in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives	something of dignity even to a bad one	3460.3628235025185
1802. the woonsocket patriot	admitted that john brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment	but he should no more be hung than henry a wise or james	buchanan	4108.519668414453
1803. the newport mercury exhibited more concern over	the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of brown than it	did over the development of sympathy for him	2861.775929180073
1804. in her letter	to john brown e b the quakeress from newport had	suggested that the american people owed more honor to john brown for	seeking to free the slaves than they did to george washington	5779.272689874974
1805. during	the latter days of november to the day of brown's execution	it seems that most rhode islanders did not concur in e b's	suggestion	2570.120423396016
1806. on november 22 1859 the providence daily journal	stated that although brown's pluck and honest fanaticism	must be admired any honor paid to brown would only induce other fanatics	to imitate his actions	5322.409827638803
1807. a week later the daily journal	had	discovered the initial plans of some providence citizens to hold a	meeting honoring john brown on the day of his execution	2986.0246161802847
1808. the editor	of the daily journal warned h that if such a demonstration	be made it will not find support or countenance from any of the men	whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for providence	6200.895931810856
1809. the providence daily post's editor wrote that he could	not	believe that a meeting honoring brown was to be held in providence	2160.7313386485043
1810. he further called upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting	and avoid disgrace	1647.3399820199945
1811. on december 2 1859 john brown was	hanged at charles town virginia	640.8830377279802
1812. extraordinary precautions were	taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within	the enclosure surrounding the scaffold	3282.5612512012667
1813. in many northern towns and	cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled	939.6367686414408
1814. such was not	the case in rhode island	250.36339597419519
1815. the only public demonstration in honor	of john brown was held at pratt's hall in providence on the	day of his execution	2167.466883538933
1816. despite the opposition of the city newspapers	the pratt hall meeting brought together a very respectable	audience composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years	for their radical views upon the subject of slavery of many of our	colored citizens and of those who were attracted to the place by the	novelty of such a gathering	8175.184566129972
1817. seated on the platform were amos c	barstow ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove	manufacturer; thomas davis an uncompromising garrisonian; the	reverend augustus woodbury a unitarian minister; the reverend	george t day a free-will baptist; daniel w vaughan	and william h h clements	4650.466989252623
1818. the latter two were appointed secretaries	64.9177380474191
1819. the first speaker was amos c barstow who had been unanimously	chosen president of the meeting	1255.2010338587784
1820. he spoke of his desire to promote	the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared john	brown of harper's ferry to the john brown of rhode island's	colonial period	4986.72480818447
1821. barstow concluded that as rhode island's john	brown became a canonized hero if not a saint so would it be with	john brown of harper's ferry	2737.1345410652057
1822. the next speaker was george	t day	140.2936790453688
1823. although admitting brown's guilt on legal grounds	day said that brown is no common criminal; his deed was not	below but above the law	2449.0218468459548
1824. following day was woodbury who spoke of his	disapproval of brown's attempt at servile insurrection his admiration	of brown's character and his opposition to slavery	3899.0962100243705
1825. woodbury's	remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times	and once there was hissing	1414.593283582743
1826. the fourth and last speaker was thomas	davis	250.37162062680585
1827. by this time large numbers of the audience had left the	hall	642.6956624261663
1828. davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling	of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the	citizens and all the newspapers of the city	4845.2111262057
1829. he said that the propriety	or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled	by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments	3211.0299711691086
1830. in the remainder of his speech davis spoke of his admiration for	brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they are	liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding	men whom the laws have condemned	6545.93221868868
1831. he recalled that in rhode island	a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man	proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law	of the land and the principles of human liberty	3758.268467647465
1832. at the close of davis'	speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president	and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously:	whereas john brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring	to deliver those who are denied all rights h and is this day doomed	to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper:	therefore   resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove	the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet h in his	willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still	recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit	which true men have always admired and which history never fails	to honor	0.30166232349522504
1833. resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in kansas	occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on	the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable	judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the despotism	from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special	sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice	5745.809007153503
1834. resolved h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for	resolute action	967.029386762533
1835. resolved that we find in this fearful tragedy	at harper's ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the	evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible h	3458.9375196410083
1836. on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the	providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was	milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes	it could have been avoided completely	6297.589810096673
1837. rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects	in space it sees nothing more than- a picture	2036.0659328452798
1838. through	1911 and 1912 as the cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to	the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping	the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving	contrivances	5920.0963216572645
1839. to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated	typography braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign	substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise	called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective	over much larger areas	4540.463420067387
1840. in certain other pictures however braque began	to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing	2342.4669328298696
1841. these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the	literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting	contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could	be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective;	that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted	within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography	except near the surface	0.20124717349522497
1842. the accumulation of such devices	however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating	surface and depth	2357.2131566282746
1843. the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it	became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to	prevent it from fusing with the illusion	2724.476353001705
1844. it was for this reason and	no other that i can see that in september 1912 braque took the radical	and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain	wallpaper to a drawing on paper instead of trying to simulate	its texture in paint	6785.060102897851
1845. picasso says that he himself had already made	his first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of	imitation-caning	oilcloth to a painting on canvas	3109.8153985728723
1846. it is true that his first	collage looks more analytical than braque's which would confirm	the date he assigns it	2824.595468540836
1847. but it is also true that braque was the	consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography;	and moreover he had already begun to broaden and simplify the	facet-planes of analytical cubism as far back as the end of 1910	4615.910836400377
1848. when we examine what each master says was his first collage we	see that much the same thing happens in each	3033.2529282067785
1849. that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal	by its greater	corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper	or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more	vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures	had ever done	5036.810854453344
1850. but here again the surface-declaring device both	overshoots and falls short of its aim	1412.794791094621
1851. for the illusion of depth created	by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else	gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives	way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seems	to contain both- or neither	4602.35763774465
1852. because of the size of the areas	it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily	as more than an indication or sign	3491.7129649474546
1853. literal flatness now tends to	assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs:	the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before	3117.129694512173
1854. instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing	it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and	the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with	which to finish as well as start his picture	6575.718577742274
1855. the actual surface	becomes both ground and background and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically-	that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion	is in front of upon the surface	3331.692425496628
1856. in their very first collages	braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed	paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their	subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space-	or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains	imbedded in or flat upon the surface	8311.56870532514
1857. and the surface is driven back	in its very surfaceness only by this contrast	942.4310169462221
1858. in the upper	center of braque's first collage fruit dish	a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally	vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture	plane	5005.512569023206
1859. the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed	between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface	of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it	3096.4455630412767
1860. yet the	violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper and the	only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering	manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture	plane so that it does not jump	6824.561273499542
1861. at the same time the wallpaper	strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and	patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation	to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed	back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality	of the woodgraining	5315.834351388821
1862. thus every part and plane of the picture keeps	changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and	it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts	of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with	the surface	7350.056349859542
1863. and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents	of picasso's first collage	1416.3033224654855
1864. in later collages of both	masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the	same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving	and eye-undeceiving device they can think of	5483.213047317959
1865. the area adjacent	to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted-in	form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface while	something will be drawn painted or even pasted over another part of	the same shape to drive it back into depth	5032.754724097623
1866. planes defined as parallel	to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is	suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially	4292.623349866556
1867. all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to	encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it	2606.639317813137
1868. flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become	so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least	an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion	5188.270026025371
1869. depicted	cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal	undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms	the undepicted kind- and it does so moreover without depriving	the latter of its literalness; rather it underpins and reinforces	that literalness re-creates it	4803.218043539746
1870. out of this re-created literalness	the cubist subject reemerged	391.3157369308391
1871. for it had turned out by a	further paradox of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and	plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation	or imaging	3567.2170975932554
1872. in the analytical phase of their cubism braque	and picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply	in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it-	to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted	from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely	as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied	attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself	0.30166232349522504
1873. in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and	as the aspect of the subject	was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable	and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity	was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became largely	unrecognizable	4715.847607064063
1874. cubism in its 1911-1912 phase	was on the verge of abstract art	960.8492224303639
1875. it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with	a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation	2029.565462606325
1876. if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se-	an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as	to exclude the representation of individual objects	5007.972992304078
1877. if on the other	hand they opted for representation it had to be representation per	se- representation as image pure and simple without connotations	of the three-dimensional space	in which the objects represented originally existed	3750.0710911766714
1878. it was the	collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational	could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface	now that illusion and representation had become for the first time	mutually exclusive alternatives	6319.596915863291
1879. in the end picasso and braque	plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so	deliberately	1572.2969537083868
1880. but the inner formal logic of cubism	as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do	with shaping their decision	3894.8202188457276
1881. when the smaller facet-planes of analytical	cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes	formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to coalesce-	become synthesized- into larger planar shapes themselves	simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane	4737.551948198225
1882. left	in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly	into depth; and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would	have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane	6181.420338771695
1883. large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves	as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat	they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes	are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject	from which a picture starts	4745.081106303276
1884. it was	because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that	is because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage	as a shape- that the identity of depicted objects or at least	parts of them re-emerged in braque's and picasso's papiers colles	and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as	flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in	oil before the end of 1913	0.30166232349522504
1885. analytical cubism came to an end	in the collage but not conclusively; nor did synthetic cubism fully	begin there	1722.5362150143653
1886. only when the collage had been exhaustively translated	into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become	an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility	and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of	unmistakable three-dimensional identities	6579.19817710972
1887. synthetic cubism began	with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the	point at which he finally took the lead in cubist innovation away from	braque never again to relinquish it	3757.1024135708844
1888. but even before that picasso	had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path	in which no one had preceded him	3502.070595763404
1889. it was as though in that instant	he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly	tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality	3448.134922839711
1890. this he did by using utterly literal means to carry	the forward push of the collage literally	into the literal space in front of the picture plane	4298.990456702739
1891. some	time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the	shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper	and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real	and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture	plane	5312.40461415808
1892. the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were	and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief	3267.6634342278876
1893. and without	high density in the core rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained	economically let alone built from scratch at today's prices	2040.3251141959477
1894. however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever	559.4516189210997
1895. the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including	the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty	acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area	about the size of rockefeller center in new york	4207.3373749055
1896. it is hard to believe	that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law	calls the highest and best use of centrally located urban land	4068.994633883226
1897. as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is	ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should	be taxed to pay for the city services	3221.148439454151
1898. subways improved land values	without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less	and reduce	the acreage that can be taxed	2821.900146385563
1899. downtown los angeles is already	two-thirds freeway interchange street parking lot and garage- one	of those preposterous if statistics has already come to pass	2460.9937623425867
1900. the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and	mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial	isolating boundary	3269.7392059498316
1901. city planners do not always use this boundary	as effectively as they might	786.1385263345426
1902. less ambitious freeway plans may be	more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are	raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking	areas below the ramp	4843.041789425034
1903. meanwhile the automobile and its friend	the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance	1569.2281474485137
1904. in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or	in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction	2842.3183235352453
1905. the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry	which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants	enough land area to do the entire job on one floor	3658.7657272658544
1906. to light industry	the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency	engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for	ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers	5773.695440730903
1907. this movement of industry away from the central cities	is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe	1890.9346555795269
1908. it	is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern	of virtually all american cities	2574.148822335302
1909. the big factories which are	relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in	akron chrysler's detroit plants ussteel's pittsburgh	works- often began on these sites at a time when that was the	edge of the city yet close to transport and	power	4610.50974028619
1910. the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and	the steam turbine and the time when the belts of residence surrounding	the old factory area were not yet blighted	4654.779299941214
1911. the truck and	the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his	plant site	1578.211400206565
1912. until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near	a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community	of lower-class homes	3889.1585928222885
1913. the railroad siding is still important- it	is usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail is	cheaper than trucking	2170.1842895449554
1914. but anybody who promises a substantial volume	of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these	days and many businesses can live without the railroad	5020.658905715651
1915. and there	are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking	lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual	pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually	more convenient than the walk-to factory	4609.32702941838
1916. willow run general	electric's enormous installations at louisville and syracuse the	pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles	the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is	substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit	6439.174369726765
1917. they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied	with workers	1101.0306847492197
1918. and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are	lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry	3058.2975086042215
1919. the	drive along massachusetts' route 128 the by-pass which makes an	arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the future	2600.467288306996
1920. the future could be worse	22.28740954068277
1921. the plants along route 128	are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new england rocks	and trees	1731.0029850059211
1922. they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument	to the astonishing success of polaroid	1877.7890890954648
1923. but they deny the values	of the city- the crowded competitive tolerant city the melting	pot which gave off so many of the most admirable american qualities	2856.3590197902226
1924. they are segregated businesses combining again on one site	the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated	communities	3067.781507234783
1925. it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts'	route 128 draw most of their income either from the government	in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation	of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly	4236.616409278404
1926. while	the factories were always the center of the labor market they were	often on the city's periphery	2346.4278028021154
1927. in spreading the factories even farther	the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth	pattern of the cities	2174.7358630393705
1928. even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's	motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation	is becoming harder to find every year	3712.630935107082
1929. what hurts most is the damage	the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in	those cities where public transit is feeble	2189.8465317539117
1930. some retailing	of course always spreads with the population- grocery stores drugstores	local haberdasheries and dress shops candy stores and the like	3278.8087841239444
1931. but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a	new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior-	the family set off for the downtown department store where the	selection would be greatest	4227.988808817627
1932. department stores congregated in the	one hundred per cent location where all the transit lines converged	1884.366506833928
1933. these stores are still there but the volume of the downtown	store has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban	branch sells more and more dry goods	3344.2409923654895
1934. if the retailer and	hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing however his dollar	volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the	bank	4485.195215192329
1935. in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are	substantially inflated	502.2096118799567
1936. no suburban shopping-center branch- not even	hudson's vast northland outside detroit- does anything like	the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise	to be found in the home store	5491.495941774947
1937. telephone orders distort the	picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city	number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if	the local call eliminates city sales tax	3448.322986555014
1938. the suburban branch is thereby	credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass	doors had never opened	3287.7290974704397
1939. accounting procedures which continue to charge	a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store	make the branches seem more profitable than they are	2602.5589990017133
1940. in many cases	that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money	on our branches would be turned around if the cost analysis were	recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store	5761.90397167605
1941. fear of the	competition- always a great motivating force in the american economy-	makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate	both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new	branches	3665.840507006633
1942. the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are	uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important	as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will	support only so many big branches	6465.003021562071
1943. moreover the cost of operations	is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who	act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover	2860.7282058771148
1944. when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major	break with history in the development of american retailing	3253.8090004992746
1945. just	as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant	to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far	easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same	distance from home	4476.896536235132
1946. indeed there are some cities where the suburban	shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown	2350.4569077688748
1947. raymond vernon reports that residents of east st louis	have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown	st louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply	because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart	of town	4813.640937318174
1948. to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive	downtown management like that of lazarus brothers in columbus	ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot	next door	5480.41795044007
1949. if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened	away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store	can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways	or await the completion of the federal highway program	4313.486777318661
1950. and if the	affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with nice	people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports	the downtown department store the central location may be in serious	trouble	5889.525193658057
1951. today according to land economist homer hoyt shopping	centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres	of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's	central business districts put together	3968.053758802217
1952. the downtown	store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within	its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately	convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available	before making up her mind	6451.84827869898
1953. if anything may be predicted in the quicksilver	world of retailing it seems likely that the suburban branch will	come to dominate children's clothing	household gadgetry and the discount business	in big-ticket items	3548.510659540356
1954. department stores were built on dry goods especially	ladies' fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban	branches will be hard put to compete against downtown	4655.148109066706
1955. if this	analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's	cost accountants refuse to acknowledge marginal operations	rather than major factors	2724.150448769104
1956. historically in america the appeal	of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience	they offered	2589.2891255862014
1957. how ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm	263.4275481767269
1958. was	a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree	1172.6663327739848
1959. though	americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious	belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality	of downtown	2735.984822742597
1960. only a radical change in the nature of the population in	the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we	must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change	gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians is actually upon us	7095.219594842261
1961. in their book american skyline	christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt's	new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility-	a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to	vote	3962.848572739394
1962. the first superhighways- new york's henry hudson and chicago's	lake shore san francisco's bay bridge and its approaches	a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike- were built as	part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression	6435.547362347895
1963. at the same time roosevelt's federal housing administration	coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy permitted	ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes	2327.6843211315145
1964. bankers	who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house	itself got that security from the u s government; householders	who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest	mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per	cent under government aegis	7411.299942841402
1965. before losing itself in the sands of the 19th century the grand stream	of italian renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance	in the brumidi frescos of the capitol rotunda in washington	3450.555193646862
1966. the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris	of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended	to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were	easy to find	5603.865148097474
1967. but it is a great conception	43.901994453056645
1968. the open ceiling with	allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky:	the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly	tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line	of correggio and his baroque followers	6674.021759483502
1969. the descent may be remote	but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance	in the united states	2028.5666371862603
1970. constantino brumidi designed the	decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles	u walter at the time when plans were being made to replace	the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure	6175.324206702234
1971. after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish	the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning	with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william	penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career	4700.217007344859
1972. he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle	1644.367074090583
1973. these were carried out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini	who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of pennsylvania	and noting in pencil in italian that he began at this point	3633.3644658481016
1974. when costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six	feet of empty frieze were left over	1869.3208169273305
1975. a blank undecorated void plastered	in roughcast disfigured the wall of the rotunda until 1951	1095.3989740450925
1976. then	advised by the architect of the capitol the joint committee	for the library traditionally responsible for the works of art in the	building ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco to show	the peace after the civil war the spanish-american war	and the birth of aviation to match as nearly as feasible	brumidi's technique and composition	8137.983686495948
1977. later the cleaning and restoration	were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of	the canopy	1720.510064850852
1978. what follows is therefore a description of three separate	undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays	in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection	with each	5324.153195022508
1979. for the use of students and future restorers	a full day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete	technical reports on what we found and what we did	3087.310834491859
1980. these may be consulted	in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library	of congress	2361.126562008616
1981. the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished	length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all	in	bad condition	2020.0602646326083
1982. it was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks	and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree	with the older artists' preparation with a mortar one part slaked	lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers	7157.3768188349595
1983. cartoons were drawn	full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities	1102.8483234383834
1984. there was some difficulty here	22.152840351653605
1985. one had to manage the given subjects	three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical	frieze- that is a pattern of large figures filling the space	with not much else against a blank background	4118.59452221452
1986. moreover all three	representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the	length brumidi allowed for each one of his	3038.4776929212658
1987. when it was all	arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement	in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place	2585.3991998847278
1988. the scaffolding a	confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and	safe but obscured visibility	2580.3229229295057
1989. nothing could be seen from the floor	but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were	able to decide on some amplification of scale	2992.30322386621
1990. to be sure of matching	color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast	and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry	out to their final key	5626.433982473742
1991. later it was gratifying to note that they had	set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came	2170.637525559459
1992. the	scaffold was the length of the space to be painted	753.2799253413812
1993. what bits of brumidi	and costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good	order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust	2599.644227539097
1994. washed	they came out surprisingly clear and bright	250.2158019686902
1995. it could be seen that	both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch	and that both followed the traditional italian fresco technique as described	by cennino cennini in the 14th century and current in italy	to this day	4457.789683137278
1996. that is they used opaque color throughout getting solid	highlights with active lime white	1421.6294227522792
1997. painting a secco is much	in evidence	93.11656553714559
1998. a brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and	much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat	2603.5971722098343
1999. this brown	is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint	1099.7812765555234
2000. in our own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick	enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in	drying	we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first	set awhile before applying the second	7107.273183378362
2001. the mortar was three parts sand	to two of lime	373.72194862120875
2002. some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol	basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us;	but to make it stiffer of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking	we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands but we	could see no other disadvantage	7603.843304330253
2003. i am told that a mortar longer slaked	might have remained longer in condition for painting	1251.3155369769006
2004. as it was it	took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held	it firmly in setting	3022.8156098984846
2005. it was obvious that to match brumidi white must	be mixed with all but the darkest tones	1404.537905365282
2006. lime white hard and brilliant	has a tendency to jump away from the other colors in drying	and also by its capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made	gradations so useful in decorative work	5803.625496147522
2007. in older italian practice	lime dried and reground bianco sangiovanni entered into such	prepared shades	1099.564207097682
2008. for convenience we chose a stronger pigment	unknown	to the early italians or to brumidi titanium oxide reserving the	active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day's	stint	5493.787504561956
2009. other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and	a little yellow ochre	949.268164483392
2010. this last was probably not in brumidi's palette	but was needed to take the chill bluish look off the new work next	to the old where softening effects	of time were seen even after thorough	cleaning	5785.095032382733
2011. the use of secco we tried to restrict to covering	joints	498.9246693881998
2012. experience showed however that it is very difficult to	paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty	and uneven	3690.352105829269
2013. later brumidi and costaggini will be seen coping with this	same problem	641.0637702932065
2014. we were forced as they were to work a good deal of	tempera into background and dark areas	2356.8880803381194
2015. we made it by doerner's	recipe five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty;	ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof	in drying	3095.0691256855207
2016. figure 1 was taken in 1953	64.49289760322327
2017. the new part is finished	14.954055578159474
2018. on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after	cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end;	where of costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point	where his work stopped	6340.856044291539
2019. one is led to speculate as to why the empty	space was there left for our century to finish	1722.6048208393756
2020. costaggini said it	was brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle	1640.872060733994
2021. brumidi's son later maintained that costaggini had compressed	and mutilated his father's designs ambitiously coveting a bit he	could claim for his very own	2480.2088189685446
2022. this question might be settled by comparing	the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions	noted presumably in brumidi's hand above the various sections of	his long preparatory drawing which has been kept	5460.044817093547
2023. whose ever	fault	it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with	his histories and come full circle with the scene of the discovery	of california gold	3317.522857679898
2024. in painting a fresco the handling of wet mortar	compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right	not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering	5004.31211322183
2025. at the	very first then brumidi was required by the classically pyramidal	shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the	seated girl on liberty's right before starting on the allegorical	figures themselves	3947.1912750209513
2026. here he put a small man whose missing hands	might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first	sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this	was to be the closing figure of the party of forty-niners and	was to hold a basket	7322.611616623108
2027. one sees costaggini's rendering of the same	figure more than thirty feet away	786.0614956103676
2028. the photograph figure 1 of the completed	frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in	useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and	by juxtaposition given a new job	to represent the witnesses of the first flight at kitty hawk in	1903	7344.46063409201
2029. the startlingly bright effect of the first washings led	the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle cleaned	and restored to go with them	2722.2526362972194
2030. the fixed wooden scaffold was removed	and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built	up from the floor	3701.63096105221
2031. every few days in the early morning as the work	progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the	plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the rotunda	pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting	4401.858458451025
2032. on this	giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after	a first dusting we began to wash	2835.8065646147384
2033. a most useful tool for wetting the	surface without running down was made from a greenhouse mist spray	nozzle welded to a hose connection to be used at low water pressure	3339.118498842213
2034. a valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower	957.5637936346023
2035. one	man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting	639.7332905451834
2036. a second	assistant mopped with two sponges	141.40110971461252
2037. in parts a repeated sponging was	needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore	the original brightness	2018.1462078780605
2038. no soap or other cleaning agent was used that	might bring in unwanted chemical reactions	1641.8897295877919
2039. the painting a fresco	stood up superbly; a little of the secco came off	943.9432031123242
2040. necessary	retouching was put on at once	140.97413196568172
2041. altogether we found the craftsmanship	first rate especially brumidi's	262.0582162257656
2042. we were greatly helped by	there being no traces of former restoring	957.6381944579107
2043. apparently not more than	dusting had ever been done and not much of that	938.3911917176845
2044. the plaster was sound	the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated	with it in all but a few unimportant places	3684.2080630693963
2045. the greatest	source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings	above soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime	very conspicuous even after cleaning particularly in the landing	of columbus oglethorpe and the indians and yorktown	4227.265121807601
2046. here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a	public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative	effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches	4822.283910831503
2047. these frescos have had no care for eighty years	264.1949431320678
2048. with naked gas jets	below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any	medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot	and damp under the iron dome in summer	5756.599778683345
2049. those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most	part unknown to me	1406.6807119601215
2050. it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i	visited your country last spring you were living and working close	to the places we saw and the streets we walked	5005.353610825749
2051. as american artists	it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as	possible	1573.25959018181
2052. this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts	to meet and talk with you been more successful	2608.15112549523
2053. even though we did not	see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable	number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune	to encounter that we had been in your midst	4117.129213342724
2054. i am very pleased that	quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to	hear of our reactions and experiences in the ussr	4445.009842697935
2055. i	can well understand your curiosity	43.581314933826675
2056. we ourselves are always eager	to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live	2587.706838166684
2057. it is	my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the	good offices of the union of soviet artists	2319.58730197012
2058. there should	be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter	1411.1988892232232
2059. pozzatti	and i endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the	prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes	2017.8788710901474
2060. the time-span	of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert	on anything i saw	2838.9848623226508
2061. too much damage is done by experts who	have spent even less time if any at all in the ussr	1869.6802155482728
2062. nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment	as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative	individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific	geo-political interests	5627.826293920858
2063. if this attitude is seriously questioned	in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority	of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for	clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view	4455.042773278293
2064. it is	a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen	are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the	plight of a minority such as artists in any social order	5886.6153898996245
2065. i encountered	many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union	about my reactions to that experience	1884.5890991693454
2066. that which i found most	profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction	1887.8051939207776
2067. almost as if i were talking about something quite unreal	373.4119076252205
2068. apparently	this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen	objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions	of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments	5506.954983791981
2069. personal	predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice	as well	942.9681574880876
2070. i cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat	unusual travelogue	1410.057224258227
2071. i am equally impatient with the shrug of the	shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they	have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are	romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word revolution;	the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who	try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical	horizons	5822.227015624564
2072. difficult as it may have been at times pozzatti and i saw	enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize	that the issue is quite clear	4452.741502476394
2073. artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends	of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not	immediately decisive in everyday life	2458.808236514376
2074. by themselves they may not	be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would	be very little left worth saving	3875.911584344136
2075. it cannot be said that our	very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one	1888.0157852013604
2076. on that cold but bright april day we were guests of your government	in the reviewing stand of red square to witness the poeple's celebration	for yuri gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat	more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces	of the kremlin	7517.8535749443645
2077. if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of	a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national	achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and	very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost	complete silence	5069.713148911989
2078. we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country	just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of	a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to	the point of foregoing the highest international honor	6703.050834024785
2079. the grave about	half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church	rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green	the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual	paths through small forests	4457.408694061343
2080. just yesterday we had met and talked with	a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his	ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously	5192.705578337681
2081. but today we were aware of only two men	261.79958211498814
2082. one had taken a flight into	uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero	2606.442306344161
2083. the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted	space of the human spirit	1259.4594313046384
2084. the flowers on his grave attested to the	fact that he as well was somebody's hero	1877.8638908316348
2085. these two recollections	form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which	to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical	conflict between materialism and humanism	3553.5992577003026
2086. a struggle that is	being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest	1653.300255204893
2087. the	prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in	your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was	elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity	3539.3662057880647
2088. the socialist	environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme	seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit	3287.934025508931
2089. when i speculated	on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations	might be unable to propagate i was immediately accused of preaching	racial prejudice	2850.5060804881778
2090. i could not bring myself to answer that some	of my best friends are non-propagating mules	1886.2166321168638
2091. this kind of	reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to	936.5011024727601
2092. after a while	we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly	discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and	illogical comparisons	4283.338054339381
2093. a chance remark about lenin's sealed train	brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to george washington's	cherry tree	2023.4773891743378
2094. theories of the behavior pattern of population masses	were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern	of gaseous masses	2575.2904306674873
2095. no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty	in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural	exchange	2027.5609427981913
2096. typical of such an experience was the occasion	of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union	of soviet artists	3479.9625795220536
2097. we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our	first informal meeting with a number of moscow's artists	1868.1967189539973
2098. instead	we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming	addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind	3891.155718346906
2099. the terms	of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become	somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use	1562.42729222772
2100. i can only	hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between	our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion	3883.399362237051
2101. the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding	appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of	friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing	the arts	3203.442612613241
2102. it was only after we had responded with what i fear were	similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire	for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and	warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos	6685.277778879821
2103. she	retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might	well terminate right then and there	1718.7072480154275
2104. unfortunately she returned later	just as i had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the	room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange	program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia	with social realism regaining dominance in the us	7029.930980381959
2105. this	gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition	that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction	2458.1992251841634
2106. she	did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that	abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that	had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr	pozatti and i could not know then that we would experience	this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere	8127.22375089941
2107. we were	to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the	impression that in contrast to other soviet regions moscow's atmosphere	is depressingly subdued and official	3316.310738688976
2108. to have one's intentions	deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste	of time	1412.1966965599015
2109. until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary	to prepare any argument formally or informally	1409.5330772763525
2110. artists simply do	not talk to each other in that fashion; and furthermore i could	not presume the implication that i spoke for american artists as a	group	4470.133062888027
2111. to save time some clarification seemed necessary	94.46071680716136
2112. the following	is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists	in leningrad:   we have come to your land with the	express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your	ways	5898.8617570329325
2113. our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence	of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek	any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all	people	3745.12076771488
2114. we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future	depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between	individuals	3692.672887006041
2115. in spite of the relatively short period of time that we	have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of	your character and spirit	2726.8060152753997
2116. we are acutely aware that yours is a society	which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed	itself into one of the foremost nations of the world	4850.91142523461
2117. your past history	is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect	502.42335566309987
2118. your present history	is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements	959.6034006455872
2119. we have come to you to experience something of your way of life	while	also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours	2309.3516822843903
2120. while we as american	artists	believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual	activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves	if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as	well as the international community as a whole	7034.127270336406
2121. in stating this position	we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists	and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect	3220.489057272551
2122. as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people	so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artists	4261.234041246386
2123. but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge	and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful	exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead	us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding	4675.981440147687
2124. like yourselves we have pride and love for our country	564.2968799973104
2125. to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian	terror in order to live in dignified freedom	2602.352054576016
2126. as artists we	feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves	responsible citizens of a great nation	2837.263305356172
2127. the sane society is an ambitious work	95.24243002849207
2128. its scope is as	broad as the question: what does it mean to live in modern society	2125.5948277780317
2129. a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed	by a moral vision must necessarily fail	2177.1289552659855
2130. even a hasty reader	will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and	argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue	emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy	evidence and the like	6165.563877267571
2131. such books are easy prey for critics	94.86021907072538
2132. nor need	the critic be captious	65.27994808847586
2133. a careful and orderly man who values precision	and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be	put off by such a book	2449.503878101562
2134. it is a simple matter for one so disposed to	take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and	ends	3704.7118175035343
2135. the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large	and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects some outworn	and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but	now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one remembers	here and there a gem everything fascinating because it suggests	some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more	than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users	0.20124717349522497
2136. that could be easily done but there is little reason in it	955.386494724886
2137. it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush	and	that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression	he has from the outset	3556.7712371725675
2138. i mention these features of the book	because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must	be mentioned	2822.675569421524
2139. it would be superfluous to build a critique around them	375.4757547816705
2140. there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account	of capitalist civilization	1407.1603516172038
2141. it is worthwhile to recall that	fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects	938.9187272481856
2142. since	i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is	incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus	on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment	4815.782971696559
2143. i shall	first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's analysis then argue	that granted these weaknesses he still has much left that is valuable	and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus	a sociological approach to the question of alienation	4459.623393817254
2144. almost	no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation	967.3740407324258
2145. despite	its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising	hypothesis and not a verified theory	1418.4900816102775
2146. the idea has received much	attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general	social criticism such as the sane society	3688.937067414571
2147. what is missing is	work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and guttman-type	attitude scales such questions as these: what are the	components	of the feeling-state described as alienation	3567.7402002449935
2148. how widespread	is alienation	4.4153368018934644
2149. what is its incidence among the various classes	and subgroups of the population	790.4739682148006
2150. taking alienation as a dependent variable	with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated	1649.7542201101146
2151. considered as an independent variable how does it affect behavior	in various sectors of life	1091.9739764873352
2152. until such work is done there must	remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than	an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and	in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair	onto the broader social screen	7103.175230703261
2153. i am not suggesting that	fromm ought to do this kind of work	782.3861987881766
2154. nor do i think that alienation	is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual	2347.611885549141
2155. i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence	comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain	important limitations	2838.9685443523367
2156. until such evidence appears we must	make do with the evidence we have	1180.9679736560079
2157. here perhaps fromm is vulnerable	for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available	and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather	special ways	3219.1345294680996
2158. fromm's analysis of alienation	in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the	bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from	control and the broad	dispersion of stock ownership	5157.926199451321
2159. for all these	points he relies exclusively on berle and means's study of 1932 the	modern corporation and private property	1886.3089298161965
2160. the broad conclusions	of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research	has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested	important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and	has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area	6687.840729116913
2161. fromm seems unaware of these developments	43.48240778384074
2162. another example	is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys	designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on	a broad	range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three	times	6416.60802992173
2163. moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not	always the only ones possible	1105.5712246289147
2164. for example he cites the following	data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study 85 per	cent of professionals and executives 64 per cent of white collar people	and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with	their jobs; in the second study the percentages were 86 for professionals	74 for managerial persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for	skilled workers and 48 for semi-skilled workers	0.30166232349522504
2165. he concludes that	these	data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfied	and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers	2044.42570707536
2166. starting	from other value premises than fromm's some analysts might conclude	that the percentages really tell us very little at all while others	might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low	5168.989342591112
2167. eric hoffer	for example once said that america was a paradise- the only	one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children	2615.704612701128
2168. what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the	only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer	who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and	satisfied	6469.987384071812
2169. fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction	conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which	49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as	he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do	his best but should turn out only the average amount	5560.5275369667925
2170. fromm says these	data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread	960.7666542639159
2171. that	is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways	936.0246555578836
2172. one	might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary	associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter	to fromm's theory of alienation	4288.949131579767
2173. or he might remind fromm that	the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all the	medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per	cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's	trade unions announce pretty much the same view	4997.87819194644
2174. in view	of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of	survey-type findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms	which can be brought against fromm's philosophical anthropology	such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously	6354.780999588857
2175. are people	happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they believe themselves	to be	942.3368177664959
2176. considering the nature of man and the conditions for	happiness this can hardly be so	1645.5297565261567
2177. the ambiguities suggested	above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought	1091.4319729259346
2178. he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways	751.0134186687545
2179. sometimes	he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an	objective diagnostic one	1265.4906393933547
2180. that is sometimes it is used to describe	felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt	anxiety and discontent	3463.7953577684734
2181. the failure to keep these two usages	distinct presents hazards to the reader	791.9347551017087
2182. it also permits fromm to do	some dubious things with empirical findings	959.1917179639344
2183. when alienation is used	as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear	that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far	toward conquering it	3205.283851011897
2184. starting from this	and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society it	would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would	be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread stated	worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker dissatisfaction	6538.147967932607
2185. the point is that in a system such as fromm's which	recognizes unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical	absolutes empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition	the writer is urging at the moment	3965.444741751241
2186. thus in the example cited above	fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being	deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports	this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations	5597.387766070749
2187. he has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied	this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied	this shows unconscious alienation	3109.562251537165
2188. this sort of manipulation is	especially troublesome in fromm's work because although his system	is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions he asserts	that it	is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and	from his own consulting room	6491.331360240156
2189. while the empirical psychoanalytic	label which fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying	philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product	2719.7582623540156
2190. the final example of the failure to use available evidence	though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered	comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have	dealt with the same themes	6163.412376712913
2191. in a brief chapter dealing with various	other diagnoses he quotes isolated passages from some writers	whose views seem to corroborate his own and finds it most remarkable	that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held	by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth h	4827.818963850639
2192. he finds	it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis	should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of	the twentieth century	4291.345117749533
2193. there is nothing remarkable about this at	all	166.33296868446615
2194. it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes	963.9671648833503
2195. there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's	citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category	1726.0463254536376
2196. glance at the list: burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau	london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a	r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein	3277.2948221845486
2197. this is a delightfully	motley collection	43.211781140422055
2198. one can make them say the same thing only by	not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants	to hear	3708.4910192963157
2199. the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that	260.49978974907975
2200. furthermore	the list is interesting for its omissions	250.87866321188645
2201. it omits for	example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english	social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position	is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called	existentialists	3962.255649466594
2202. of course the list also excludes all writers who are	fairly optimistic about the modern situation; these almost	by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology	4087.468261800316
2203. it is not hard	to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable	when you ignore all who hold a different opinion	2455.008378699236
2204. turning from	these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty	in fromm's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use	of certain important terms	4620.264887755633
2205. one such instance has already been presented:	his use of alienation	498.3472701705356
2206. the only other one i shall mention here	is his use of the term capitalism	1646.7750325573015
2207. for fromm capitalism is	the enemy the root of all evil	503.57838807308747
2208. it is of course useful to have a sovereign	cause in one's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and	prescription much easier than they might otherwise be	4281.929361630881
2209. if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is	the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the	chorus- comes alive in the music	2603.824760691608
2210. much of this lifelike quality results	from mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech	inflections	2351.092884925288
2211. in this he followed a path that led back to the very	source of opera; such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell	with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively	attuned to their own languages	4141.399199883896
2212. through long experimentation	in his songs mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different	from others as the language itself	2605.335818228348
2213. giving most of his musical continuity	to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence	but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words	3120.0093013758706
2214. the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when	the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and	liturgical chants	4469.981399029733
2215. otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies	for prolonged expressions of emotion- boris' first monologue for	example	1251.515788574332
2216. even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that	the word comes first in importance	1640.6420298522175
2217. aside from boris himself	one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among	the masters of musical portraiture	1892.102342782402
2218. even those who appear in only one	or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision	2121.819763262063
2219. consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action:	pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni	1419.3472196252555
2220. under no circumstances	could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has	an individual touch	2127.1306808431227
2221. pimen is an old man weak in body- his	voice rarely rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind	2175.556608861269
2222. his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement	249.84494278453857
2223. a	quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever	the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past	life:    this theme comes to represent the outer world the	realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct	from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery	5298.590716387854
2224. it changes and develops	according to the text; it introduces pimen when he comes before	boris in the last act	2821.7921902748853
2225. once he has been identified however a	new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren	octaves creating a rather ancient effect:    an imaginative	storyteller pimen takes on the character he describes as if he	were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure	4853.617090504795
2226. here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification	of the mood through key relationships	2126.2889403292656
2227. the original d minor seems	to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move	away from it	1713.1260403058682
2228. as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light-	in the form of the major mode- begins to appear and at the moment	of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major	5651.467638231734
2229. varlaam	and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward	rhythmically	vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from	the more subtle and well-educated pimen	2728.93604874738
2230. their begging song might	easily be a folk melody:    the same could be said for the	song to which they make their entrance in the final scene	4277.925968195666
2231. apparently	their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated	641.6081502049112
2232. whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb	them now	1182.563480697069
2233. missail is the straight man not very talkative	mild-mannered when he does speak	788.3276878711897
2234. varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited	in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same	2117.4184027913752
2235. a	rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn	scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into	the action:    the song of kazan in which this figure	becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined	high spirits	4557.513225868928
2236. the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key	changes have a primitive forcefulness	1190.403153540321
2237. varlaam's music begins to ramble	as he feels the effects of the wine but he pulls himself together	when the need arises	2179.5221773110256
2238. both monks respond to the guard's challenge	with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch	is varlaam's labored reading of the warrant	4089.2085802440574
2239. as the knack gradually	comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony	of an unskilled reader	1880.7941839875555
2240. for the only time in the opera words	are not set according to their natural inflection; to do so would	have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene	4488.436744296651
2241. musically and	dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as	varlaam	951.6729627779307
2242. his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality	that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's	hoffman	2826.9147194691736
2243. his speech shows none of the native accent of the	russian characters; in spite of the italian name he sounds french	2037.9981521775885
2244. his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who	is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized	1876.270181917548
2245. rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth	in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it	2040.2089357497694
2246. the effect is as	if he had materialized out of nowhere	753.7420348542539
2247. he speaks quietly concealing	his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies	that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them	2853.190653824536
2248. he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess	at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme	that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the	position of a solicitous father	6314.077707319034
2249. curiously this scene is a close	parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time the scene	between amonasro and aida	2321.086256878986
2250. rangoni and amonasro have the same	purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her	country's cause- and their tactics are much the same	4477.194107075777
2251. rangoni begins	by describing the sad state of the church; this brings a reaction	of distress from marina	1582.2254608211947
2252. the music becomes ethereal as he calls	up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she he tells her who can	bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics	5004.974926523888
2253. as if in a trance	she repeats his words- then realizes with a shock her own audacity	1419.914427309086
2254. this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him	758.6310064364699
2255. now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time	a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic	motif of his sinister power	2974.3815750052604
2256. it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's	gesture with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness	3044.585640644406
2257. another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her	to gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor	2461.793922364718
2258. coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice:	marina rebels at this suggestion	2115.946184641922
2259. her pride is as much at	stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty the princess who	turns away suitors by the dozen	2459.6374720476188
2260. indignantly she denounces rangoni	for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her	1411.9251378576937
2261. at once the	jesuit pulls out all the stops	259.87860710522693
2262. to music of a menacing darkness	he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl poisoning	her soul with pride and destroying her beauty	4088.5340234875575
2263. the combined threat	of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified	at his feet	1720.4628179229244
2264. with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and	protective exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman-	and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction	4843.470994213057
2265. whatever	the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now; we	are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts	through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the	atmosphere	4311.02569920233
2266. the most unusual feature of boris however	is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus	2350.8079619526607
2267. this is the	real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not boris versus grigori	or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but boris	versus the russian people	3350.9740027149296
2268. mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the	extent to which choral scenes propel the action	1641.1490177209303
2269. boris' first entrance	seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene	with its dazzling confusion of tonalities	1867.6687504545214
2270. we have a brief glimpse	of the tsar's public personality the official boris but our	real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast	with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene its bitter	resentment and fury in the final act	6832.286900686608
2271. one reason for the unique	vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression	1098.784431115939
2272. it rarely	speaks as a unit	66.24129907520472
2273. even in its most conventional appearance the guests'	song of praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing	the princess for her coldness	2596.5608206598654
2274. in many passages- for example	the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character	group with a particular opinion	3281.0870363707554
2275. hot arguments arise between	tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an	idea	1725.8824277922054
2276. the opening scene shows this method at its most individual	561.0538758233579
2277. mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those	who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without	understanding the causes	2589.730126162236
2278. they are held in control by force but	barely	390.98578430687746
2279. they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely	intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath	but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and	grumble and fight among themselves	4133.214227949405
2280. there is a quick change from the	plaintive song to a conversational tone	1190.2309945365807
2281. hey mityukh asks one	group what are we shouting about	376.8192506444393
2282. and mityukh apparently	the intellectual leader of the crowd replies that he has no notion	1643.8881602032748
2283. the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then	the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending	it with a wail of despair	3231.756898359327
2284. mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical	music with considerable dramatic force	395.36070463803884
2285. in pimen's cell the	soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage not only help to set	the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori's thoughts	and his situation	3234.54047017714
2286. this is especially striking between pimen's	quiet exit and grigori's vehement outburst against boris	1412.3115872392189
2287. again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into	the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch	to the grim atmosphere:  the words are hardly calculated	to put the tsar's mind at ease	4162.980707243518
2288. they echo the words with which	he has described his own vision of the dying child who trembles and	begs for mercy- and there is no mercy	4297.852834194531
2289. the living as well as	the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal	one	1891.8536802168674
2290. one of the outstanding assets of the present production	is the restoration of the st basil's scene usually omitted	from performances and rarely included in a published score	4483.696450838952
2291. though brief	it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy	509.63138977367606
2292. in addition	it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of	the people's attitude toward boris and the false dimitri	3898.1507830362125
2293. the mayhem	in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel	504.16752265113007
2294. the st basil's	scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the	square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny	3262.5204030514496
2295. in the	orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato figure then	the insistent police motif as it appeared in the opening scene	2331.495634703254
2296. the service is over and a number of people come from the church	with their spokesman mityukh in the lead	2833.426237045041
2297. they bring the news that	the pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by	the hearers who claim that mityukh is lying or drunk	2737.66499123456
2298. contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn	there is still more news mityukh	announces: they have prayed for the soul of the tsarevich	3888.1624850197863
2299. so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly	assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse	expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development	3655.4848017096133
2300. for critics	hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early hardy	or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply	of hardy as of a poetic monolith	5650.724916897847
2301. this seems odd when one recalls	that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet: domicilium	is dated between 1857 and 1860; seeing the	moon rise is dated august 1927	3447.572175678074
2302. one might expect that in a poetic	career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would	have occurred some development taken place	3702.0196775909635
2303. this is not however	the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy	only in a very limited sense	2338.9639527254085
2304. in a time when poetic style and poetic	belief as well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stands out	as a poet of almost perverse consistency	4482.485109205985
2305. though he struggled with	philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his	twenties; the sober opinion of his letter to noyes written	when hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first philosophical	notebook entry made when he was twenty-five:	the	world does not despise us: it only neglects us		4501.156097615302
2306. and though in his later years he revised his poems many	times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style	which he had established before he was thirty; so that while it usually	is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one	7423.191124033401
2307. there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about	hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and	more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his	3762.7939812579425
2308. there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style	is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the	style of another poet or of the fashion of the time	5923.230528496583
2309. in the later poems	however the personal tone predominates	262.75136907575217
2310. the bad early poems are	bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the bad late poems are bad	hardy	2144.718144352084
2311. there are two ways of getting at a poet's development:	through his dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later	editions of his work	2851.2145311162594
2312. about a quarter of hardy's poems carry	an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive	years or two separate dates when hardy worked	on the poem or an approximate date		4152.134450208379
2313. these dates are virtually the only clues we have to	the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological	within themselves nor in relation to each other	3229.053876558316
2314. with the	exception of satires of circumstance each volume contains dated	poems ranging over several decades	; the internal organization rarely has any chronological order	except in obvious groups like the poems of pilgrimage the	poems of 1912-13 and the war poems	5094.003469391707
2315. from the dated poems	we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry	always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole	must remain tentative	2983.459541088636
2316. the dated poems suggest that while hardy's	concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not	2333.1492292041853
2317. he had two productive periods one in the late 1860's the other	in the decade from 1910 to 1920	latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all hardy's		2367.3302644001506
2318. there was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between	1872 and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to italy	in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890	5365.189723984162
2319. the dated poems also	give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past productions	for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication	of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time	4121.074505865918
2320. poems of the past	and the present and time's laughingstocks both published	while hardy was at work on the dynasts draw heavily on poems	written before 1900	4295.954145793534
2321. satires of circumstance and moments of	vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained;	the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that	is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the	latter has only a few such	4554.623664346411
2322. the last three volumes are again more dependent	on the past as hardy's creative powers declined in his old	age	2841.8674430556907
2323. these observations about hardy's productivity tally with	the details of his life as we know them	1259.639236792641
2324. the first productive period	came when he was considering poetry as a vocation before he had decided	to write fiction for a living	he wrote that he wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose		4306.523310156857
2325. during the poetically sterile	years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was	in addition burdened with bad health		1800.5003826496807
2326. two entries in the early life support the assumption that	during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry	3038.552415393994
2327. mrs hardy records that h at the end of november 1881	he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible	; and on christmas day 1890 hardy	wrote: while thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of	poesy' before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying	pettinesses to disappear	4372.550495494843
2328. there	are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- hardy	had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume	of his fiction- but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one	in 1895 the year of jude	6830.59582845846
2329. after 1895 the number increases and	in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no	dated poem- 1903 when hardy was at work on the dynasts	3451.490198169795
2330. the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can	be related to three events: the completion of the dynasts in 1909	which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years;	the death of emma hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional	effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the first	world war	8474.335977216162
2331. it may seem strange that a poet should come to full	fruition in his seventies but we have it on hardy's own authority	that h he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was	five-and-twenty	and a young man till he was nearly fifty	life		3993.1663157213106
2332. we may carry this sequence one step further and say	that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only	the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to	loose those powers in poetry	6457.205579819494
2333. hardy's two productive decades	were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in	that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing not an expanding	process	3200.6686535749977
2334. like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian	sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction	to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock	of his talent flourish	5923.419581403563
2335. the range of the later poetry is considerably	narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater	1570.4297879895728
2336. we	can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look	at two poems of very different qualities: revulsion	and neutral tones	3717.460563680101
2337. there is not much to be said for revulsion	259.62995296119306
2338. like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet	on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love	2608.6577838630724
2339. almost anyone could	have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent	statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it	is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy	3755.811051764346
2340. the language	is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image	that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality	to the poem	4849.517998152898
2341. it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the	smoothness of anonymity	787.0582701308576
2342. it is obviously a young man's poem written	out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion	without evoking it- that is to say it is sentimental	4622.381768048852
2343. there are many	such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems	506.63599472146507
2344. neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in	hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial	language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd	stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to	resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems	7555.673166238843
2345. the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic	sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech-	only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept therebylike an	ominous bird a-wing or wrings with wrong or would describe	a winter sun as god-curst	4978.267666567133
2346. the details of the setting	of neutral tones are not strictly speaking metaphorical but	they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal	winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the	emotions and the elements symbolize each other in a way that is common	to many of hardy's best poems	and to	some moving passages in the novels as well		0.30166232349522504
2347. neutral	tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style drawn	from his earliest productive period; i cite it as evidence that he	did not develop through new styles as he grew older	but that he simply learned to use better what he already had	4591.5576720335
2348. in the	poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if	it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to	the vision	4669.324302137744
2349. in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism is	a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's	right to speak as he does	3111.674409692387
2350. in the 1860-70 decade there are	many poems like revulsion but there is only one neutral tones	2138.189850913448
2351. hardy was not hardy very often	43.72959889518696
2352. the poems of 1912-13	offer a good example of hardy's style as it was manifested	in the later productive decade	2816.911682872834
2353. these are the poems hardy wrote after	the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what	might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness	and ended in long years of suffering and hatred	4376.840421930697
2354. hardy obviously felt	that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes	called them an expiation and he would not allow them to be published	in periodicals	4472.455538588835
2355. they are the only poems that he rearranged as	a group between their first appearance	and the publication of the collected poems	2187.665001894108
2356. the elegiac	tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising	that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his	3502.5471039487284
2357. the	view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic-	hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable	pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead	3965.250882889287
2358. the	poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient flame;	the fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does	in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks	and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted	7566.000560320373
2359. critically invisible modern revolt like x-rays and radioactivity	is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels	where	it is called delinquency	2472.0494456594906
2360. disaffiliation by the way	is the term used by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who has	written several articles on this subject the first of which in the	nation quoted as epigraph we disaffiliate h- john l	lewis	6222.501932867346
2361. like the pillars of hercules like two ruined titans	guarding the entrance to one of dante's circles stand two	great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation:	the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thomas	3952.828846925987
2362. if	the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately	destroyed themselves	1178.2646320090055
2363. both of them were overcome by the horror	of the world in which they found themselves because at last they	could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical	art	3653.040788430004
2364. both of them were my friends	65.0635115516768
2365. living in san francisco i saw	them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted	by exasperation or fatigue	2307.514536681634
2366. so as the years passed i saw them	each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration	2355.033255288391
2367. the last time i saw bird at jimbo's bob city he was so	gone-	so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he	realized i was there	3440.7573978705104
2368. what happened man	0.30041514999999996
2369. i said referring	to the pretentious jazz concert	167.393886162083
2370. evil man evil he	said and that's all he said for the rest of the night	1888.5097816807113
2371. about dawn	he got up to blow	93.89031064241428
2372. the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent	melody spiraled through it	1186.7222512031217
2373. the last time i saw dylan	his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality	1257.306470105348
2374. it	had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter	391.33228918388807
2375. being with	him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones	939.5266933139526
2376. now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common	than the same disastrous end	2352.453623882242
2377. as artists they were very similar	43.36154182164843
2378. they were both very fluent	22.423288149749066
2379. but this fluent enchanting utterance had	compared with important artists of the past relatively little content	1255.4471755806778
2380. neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture	at his own creativity	1887.3650857624384
2381. the principal theme of thomas's poetry was	the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation	1563.8284429804733
2382. music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew	charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own	gift	4273.726029228157
2383. both of them did communicate one central theme: against the	ruin of the world there is only one defense- the creative act	2189.258894709235
2384. this	of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry	955.8303746153846
2385. it is	the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance	to parker or thomas	1248.7751297594275
2386. the difference is that horace accepted his theme	with a kind of silken assurance	1403.9183003002245
2387. to dylan and bird it was an agony	and terror	373.82444169305205
2388. i do not believe that this is due to anything especially	frightful about their relationship to their own creativity	2587.8614452112147
2389. i believe	rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity	seemed to be the sole value	2023.411752196086
2390. horace's column of imperishable	verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome	1633.5321053621071
2391. art	may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity	of man	1097.4150400386445
2392. but the other activities of his life partook of these values	746.3073135599936
2393. they did not actively negate them	43.3000841208303
2394. dylan thomas's verse had to	find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews	1880.008685022558
2395. he was	able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air	raids and gas ovens	2174.110928650877
2396. as the world began to take on the guise of an immense	air raid or gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him	3893.6195145806932
2397. i think all this could apply to parker just as well although because	of the nature of music it is not demonstrable- at least not	conclusively	2726.2721822314143
2398. thomas and parker have more in common than theme	attitude life pattern	959.428397726648
2399. in the practice of their art there is an	obvious technical resemblance	640.6130943505925
2400. contrary to popular belief they were	not great technical innovators	557.8926556229085
2401. their effects are only superficially	startling	44.057304016814776
2402. thomas is a regression from the technical originality and	ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire	2134.6454332444087
2403. similarly	the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly	overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus	the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado	2971.1129251523253
2404. the tonal novelties	consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music	for centuries	2109.8675840563747
2405. and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive	jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is	between two movements of many conventional symphonies	2603.1898847311486
2406. what parker	and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach	etc- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation	of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became	an integral part and with which it then developed	6179.447438497524
2407. this is true	of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages	of almost anybody- benny carter johnny hodges	2169.5559675127543
2408. it is true of	the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least	is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow	the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or	strophe	6437.571415730317
2409. this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque	to rococo music	786.1624563997043
2410. it is the difference between bach and mozart	250.01979107523204
2411. it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas	did to poetry	1249.600884709993
2412. the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith	sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern	2133.904511316812
2413. the metaphysical	conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation still	dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries	1245.891890731011
2414. thomas's	ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves	248.51834632453557
2415. the immediate	theme if it exists is incidental and his main theme- the terror of	birth- is simply reiterated	1732.2917819875788
2416. this is one difference between	bird and dylan which should be pointed out	1176.2772059284919
2417. again contrary to popular	belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically	or emotionally	1419.3221810844657
2418. his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence	of all experience	957.1210236055573
2419. emotionally it does not resemble berlioz	or wagner; it resembles mozart	500.47333267904077
2420. this is true also of a painter	like jackson pollock	564.1654039512729
2421. he may have been eccentric in his behavior	but his paintings are as impassive as persian tiles	1417.8543667830238
2422. partly this difference	is due to the nature of verbal communication	756.2165137366419
2423. the insistent talk-aboutiveness	of the general environment obtrudes into even the most	idyllic poetry	948.4321189864746
2424. it is much more a personal difference	141.7831985782025
2425. thomas certainly	wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world	945.5461824904529
2426. parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world	1183.4250004634434
2427. technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance	but it is interesting that parker following lester young was	one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution	3097.71537483707
2428. in modern	jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional	embouchure	1668.643884045232
2429. metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional	as was incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart	crane	1569.0792067032266
2430. i want to make clear what i consider the one technical	development in the first wave of significant post-war arts	2815.7623467839285
2431. ornament	is confabulation in the interstices of structure	165.91854323559153
2432. a poem by dylan	thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson	pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves	3706.1331362186875
2433. confabulation	has come to determine structure	43.3182161511377
2434. uninhibited lyricism should	be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile extraneous	invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic	professors	3490.0216141534665
2435. just as hart crane had little influence on anyone	except very reactionary writers- like allen tate for instance	to whom valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities	of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard were nonsense- so dylan	thomas's influence has been slight indeed	4905.006165823173
2436. in fact his only	disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was w s graham	who seems to have imitated him without much understanding and	who has since moved on to other methods	5475.668283265021
2437. thomas's principal influence	lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct	british romantic school of the new apocalypse- henry treece j	f hendry and others- all of whom were quite conventional	poets	3850.7160018449636
2438. parker certainly had much more of an influence	250.89223587855463
2439. at one	time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school	band in america to blow like bird	2179.4129297299087
2440. even before his death this influence	had begun to ebb	562.0315839707341
2441. in fact the whole generation of the founding	fathers of bop- gillespie monk davis blakey and the	rest-	are just now at a considerable discount	2623.744631905721
2442. the main line of development	today goes back to lester young and by-passes them	1408.523890462688
2443. the point	is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays	are aberrant idiosyncratic	1400.7046178646945
2444. there is no longer any sense of continuing	development of the sort that can be traced from baudelaire to	eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to	gertrude stein	5157.504387490955
2445. the cubist generation before world war 1 and	on a lower level the surrealists of the period between the wars both	assumed an accepted universe of discourse in which to quote andre	breton it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the	sciences	4608.974198771315
2446. i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today	250.45887371130857
2447. continuity exits	but like the neo-swing music developed from lester young it is	a continuity sustained by popular demand	1737.4386643059545
2448. in the plastic arts	a very similar situation exists	392.0238126981588
2449. surrealists like hans arp and max	ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by	walking on them with painted soles or by tossing bits of paper up in	the air	3540.4083449179293
2450. but it is obvious that they were self-deluded	246.86472572234862
2451. nothing looks	anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp	949.9129526439863
2452. nothing	looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion	964.107188581224
2453. many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles	of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look	like accidents	2335.390835625216
2454. the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random	may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal	2583.3030785853994
2455. once again what has	happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents	of painting	1262.0559728977912
2456. it is curious that at its best the work of this	school of painting- mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still	robert motherwell willem de-kooning and the rest- resembles	nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters:	the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee	itself a formula derived from renoir; the splashes of light and	black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of hals and sargent	0.30166232349522504
2457. often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure	utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values	2034.4657541801867
2458. you have only to compare such painting with the work of say	sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly	3480.697004731474
2459. at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo	decorative surface	641.5141611356679
2460. its poverty shows up immediately when compared	with tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity	and power	2816.932319087369
2461. a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a	universe of tensions in vast depths	788.7266056662897
2462. a pollock is an object of art-	bijouterie- disguised only by its great size	1413.8448613889254
2463. in fact once the size	is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than	extremely expensive wallpaper	2180.55748332066
2464. now there is nothing wrong with complicated	wallpaper	251.03504368060763
2465. there is just more to tiepolo	43.70955804749629
2466. the great ashikaga	brush painters painted wallpapers too- at least portable ones	screens	1190.349309386597
2467. a process of elimination which leaves the artist with	nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest	in either artist or public for very long	2998.016018623134
2468. so in the last couple	of years abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion-	indications of landscape or living figures	2824.3526945220196
2469. anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions	a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic	age	2182.4927977721677
2470. hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg	and improvises the tale of beowulf's exploits in	a complimentary comparison of the geatish visitor with sigemund	; alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery	of ares and aphrodite and takes up	a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on		5123.1673321544495
2471. nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike	the poets of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf is	not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the odyssey	reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel	demodocus	4472.9723749780305
2472. since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing	is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there	is prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each	derive from an oral tradition	5649.1375061259805
2473. that such a tradition lies behind	the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny	1416.0255950679418
2474. milman	parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant homeric	poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could	be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survived;	he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate	oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary	that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas	8474.907725379559
2475. proceeding from	parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata francis p	magoun jr argues that beowulf likewise was created from	a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive	generations and the thesis is striking and compelling	4298.90587061827
2476. yet a fresh	inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: beowulf and	the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent	3493.8271312787883
2477. the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a	very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained	narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even	in a language of many terminal inflections	4536.2790514160015
2478. assonance seems nearly	as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury	declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle	commenced at hastings	4649.722379170484
2479. the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the	homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse	of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy	to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents	perforce in earning a livelihood	4691.62298479324
2480. yet certain aids were valuable	and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without	a pause	2357.209469365883
2481. the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots	a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame	2313.179030029265
2482. but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously	with no apparent effort	1412.053142834633
2483. even though the bondage of his verse is not	so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for	him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid	composition	3943.324376455638
2484. the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which	provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the homeric poet	had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter	4669.933936069595
2485. either	poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply	his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings	and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous	synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns	4457.020005929612
2486. other synonyms	could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i	shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble	sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the danes	6201.451174066869
2487. verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction	but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and	adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the	members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic	language	4600.666073848102
2488. limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon	as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently	the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same	soil	5470.973743066123
2489. but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before	him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and	substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably	be ascribed to an oral tradition	4132.527344848196
2490. one of the greatest	homerists of our time frederick m combellack argues that when	it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the	postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited with	or denied originality in choice of phrasing	6686.143363190533
2491. any example of grand	or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous	lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his	completely	unknown fellow-craftsmen	3767.0503336255824
2492. the quest of the historical homer	is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the	iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man; no strikingly	effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance	be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus	that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before	christ	8831.93891107659
2493. this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric	poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well	1873.8132081621575
2494. to the	extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although	plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the	standard modus dicendi	4827.644556885351
2495. combellack argues further and here	he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey	are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to	formulaic poetry homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they	previously found arable	4309.1933014897
2496. with a few important and a few more unimportant	exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its	context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established	practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow	6210.666239249282
2497. words	or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or	humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable	time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not	3113.323947822577
2498. this observation	too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry	389.56787121576747
2499. to the extent that	a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded	as no more distinguished than other cliches	2029.2456281415496
2500. w f bryan	suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected sometimes	for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but	such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language	of beowulf is formulaic	5921.46923345854
2501. if the master of scops who was most	responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he	was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd	and sophisticated misuse of speech elements	4035.2210258426844
2502. once many significant	phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for	prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties	in isolated contexts	4831.948462041329
2503. it is false to be certain of having discovered	in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony	1721.4364547294904
2504. yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a	great deal in bryan's view after all	2596.453069846598
2505. a formulaic element need not	be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious	reflection	1407.8370392172285
2506. time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are	they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous	1636.197047223713
2507. a long evolution	in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic	age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things	and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually	accurate	4026.4787367341514
2508. true we do not know how they were regarded in their	day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive	to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who	have read germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found	much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases	8170.281407084125
2509. nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce;	in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus	and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation	3546.338685990492
2510. reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars	in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable	ruins of heorot or the palace of priam	5005.260086769707
2511. a ship at dry-dock	could be called a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift	ship in greek	1568.8113310798508
2512. even when defenseless of weapons the danes would be	gar-dene and priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s	1644.9990364422586
2513. achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied	is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly	be called swift-footed even when he stands idle	2318.1948721466542
2514. in coriolanus	the agnomen of marcius is used deliberately and pointedly but the	homeric epithets and the anglo-saxon kennings are used casually and	recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or	pleasant quality of the referent	6479.410313561611
2515. the epic language was not entirely	the servant of the poet; it was partly his master	1255.6842721026278
2516. the poet's	intentions are difficult to discern and except to biographers unimportant;	the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the	effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable	5318.582436070992
2517. beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions	167.21291874372264
2518. yet	they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed	1173.8708696124886
2519. albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated	to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured	but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it	would	be useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf	poet and cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion	5516.89694356349
2520. this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by	the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional	manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes	into his works	6187.068008075721
2521. if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet	may have been also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and	the odyssey	2326.838399748655
2522. in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate	bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry	recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids	to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of	the compositions of the past	7531.704779609921
2523. other theories of origin are compatible	with the formulaic theory: beowulf may contain a design for	terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering	to a ceramic pattern produced during the geometric period in	pottery	4041.4936954549084
2524. the account of the growth and final transcription of these	epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic	3259.012999863002
2525. carl eduard schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated	exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so	as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted	2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times	4216.188793523108
2526. thus one line in	five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere	else in the two poems	3059.6118976868925
2527. the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the	lines are so long- half again as long as those of beowulf	1724.7581807474191
2528. anglo-saxon	poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition;	there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines	and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric colleague	5622.317684428247
2529. in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle	however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety	for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet	to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs	4601.364236393734
2530. the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric	epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be	3500.2651486334516
2531. the iliad has two words for the shield |a|s|p|i|s	and |s|a|k|o|s	505.1308379931638
2532. recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize	its symbolic and mythic content to show as m d zabel has	said of dickens generally that much of the novel's impact resides	in its allegoric insight and moral metaphor	6177.115935550582
2533. j h miller's	excellent chapter on great expectations has lately illustrated	how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective	2179.8145427039067
2534. in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea	generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is	central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature	of the narrative	6302.0508006534155
2535. this essay seeks to make that exploration	92.82603365888981
2536. dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian	writers	1184.3219726310483
2537. he knew instinctively that next to voice and face an	actor's hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as	in the theatre gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing	character and dramatizing action and response	3958.3448195162264
2538. it is hardly accidental	therefore that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or	eccentric things with their hands	2818.816887202571
2539. in great expectations the hands	become almost an obsession	262.5246545499902
2540. mr jaggers habitually bites his	forefinger	a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness	that half fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him	4264.257594478587
2541. miss havisham's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were	somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her	broken heart and her walking stick	2714.52230755211
2542. pumblechook's signature	is the perpetually extended glad hand	248.89538088615828
2543. wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction	by regularly rubbing his hands together	370.17176409200226
2544. old mr pocket's	frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing	wife is to put his two hands into his disturbed hair and make	an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas	joe gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of mrs joe by apologetically	drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose	8007.923083598691
2545. such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it	not that in great expectations as in no other of dickens' novels	hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme- a kind of unifying	symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships	and the values and attitudes that motivate them	5173.768606674212
2546. dickens	not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial	element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel	by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters	and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit	crime greed education materialism enslavement	friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption	8218.02480237556
2547. we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer	in thomas burke's famous story the hands of mr ottermole	to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment	3534.2784162674952
2548. so it is with great expectations whether the hands be	orlick's	as he strikes down mrs gargery or pip's as he steals a	pie from her pantry	4303.695577794189
2549. such associations suit well with the gothic or	mystery-story aspects of dickens' novel but on a deeper plane they	relate to the themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently	been analyzed by other critics	3854.0545172815823
2550. the novel opens with a fugitive	convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being laid hands	on- a mysterious figure who looks into pip's frightened	eyes in the churchyard as if he were eluding the hands of the dead	people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist	upon his ankle and pull him in	8194.020833847926
2551. magwitch terrifies pip into	stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination	of a bogy man who may softly creep h his way to him and tear	him open in him	3957.2022826208863
2552. as pip agonizes	over the theft that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience	projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transforming	it into a phantom devoting me to the hulks	5628.66130228853
2553. held	upside down in the graveyard pip clings in terror with both hands	to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table	just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the	front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which	he has brought to gargery's forge for mending	5555.085744840818
2554. through such details	dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic	bond between pip and magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter	both their lives	4848.152438644508
2555. since they commonly translate thoughts and	feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly	half the characters in great expectations are of the underworld	or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence	is not to be wondered at	4619.625417200653
2556. dickens for excellent psychological reasons	never fully reveals magwitch's felonious past but pip at the	convict's climactic reappearance in london shrinks from clasping	a hand which he fears might be stained with blood	5329.79629388713
2557. orlick	slouches about the forge like cain with his hands in his pockets	and when he shouts abuse at mrs joe for objecting	to his holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them upon her	bosom and upon her knees and clenches them in her husband's	hair	4869.1830035158055
2558. this last rampage is only the prelude to the vicious	blow upon her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity	is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action- the tracing	of orlick's hammer upon a slate	6200.979087832261
2559. pip himself is to feel the	terror of orlick's murderous hand in his secret rendezvous	at the sluicehouse on the marshes	2027.3738665281512
2560. dickens lays great emphasis on	the hands in this scene	559.3946863851804
2561. orlick shakes his hand at pip bangs the table	with his fist draws his unclenched hand across his mouth as if	his mouth watered for his victim lets his hands hang loose and	heavy at his sides and pip observes him so intensely that he knows	of the slightest action of his fingers	5123.139855889721
2562. orlick might almost	be magwitch's bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip's	phantasy of guilt	2355.2975488248308
2563. the scarred disfigured wrists of mr	jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister	past for her master coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests makes	a point of the force of grip there is in these hands	4116.4035406848
2564. jaggers'	iron control over her	any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling	rests on his having once got her acquitted	of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to	conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs	of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails	8545.920658457786
2565. it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's	that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and	establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and	the genteel cruelty of satis house	4120.251887465904
2566. finally magwitch's pursuit	of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begins by his holding him	in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates	in his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him	thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which	compeyson drowns	7513.41448803254
2567. magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent	of justice	260.1372894085857
2568. but only in one of its aspects is great expectations	a tale of violence revenge and retribution	2122.3929222660236
2569. money so	important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central and hands are	often associated in some way with the false values- acquisitiveness	snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice-	that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth	4298.252389109974
2570. dickens suggests	the economic evils of such a society on the first page	of his novel in the description of pip's five little dead brothers	who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal	struggle who seemed to have all been born on their backs	with their hands in their trousers-pockets and had never taken them	out	in this state of existence	8626.189864671253
2571. pip's great expectations his	progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat as they	do for the naive hero of dreiser's american tragedy upon	the	lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income- what wemmick calls	portable property and what jaggers reproaches pip for letting	slip through his fingers	4728.185978637494
2572. since a gentleman	must if possible avoid sullying them by work his hands as importantly	as his accent become the index of social status	3704.9927123113057
2573. almost the first	step in the corruption of pip's values is the unworthy shame he	feels when estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands: they	had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar	appendages	4121.274913134826
2574. pip imagines how estella would look down upon	joe's hands roughened by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast	between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize	the opposition of values between which pip struggles- idleness	and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness	and affection- in fact between satis house and the forge	8269.427350416383
2575. when the snobbery that alienates pip from joe finally gives way before	the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an	embarrassed handshake at which pip exclaims no don't wipe it	off- for god's sake give me your blackened hand!	pip's abject leave-taking of miss havisham during which he kneels	to kiss her hand signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who	seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour; when on the	journey to london that immediately follows he pauses nostalgically	to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden	pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence	and the corruption of worldly vanity	0.20124717349522497
2576. incidentally one cannot	miss the significance of this gesture for dickens reintroduces it associatively	in pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis-	his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his	hopeless attachment to estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic	6895.900862032747
2577. in both cases the finger-post represents pip's heightened awareness	of contrary magnetisms	639.5207766057907
2578. a variety of hand movements helps	dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world pip encounters beyond	the forge	2605.157804335472
2579. the vulturelike attendance of the pocket family upon	miss havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of miss camilla	pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of	grief-stricken choking then lays it upon her heaving bosom with	an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kisses it to	miss havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward estella	5709.554335574788
2580. pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed	and hypocritical self-aggrandizement	961.6523807878502
2581. we first see him shaking mrs	joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid	to her husband for pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping	pip's hands for the hundredth time at least	in effusive congratulation to pip on	his expectations	4594.737981553184
2582. we take leave of pumblechook as he gloats over pip's	loss of fortune extending his hand with a magnificently forgiving	air and exhibiting the same fat five fingers one of which	he identifies with the finger of providence and shakes at pip	in a canting imputation of the latter's ingratitoode and	his own generosity as pip's earliest benefactor	8121.70777586167
2583. pip first learns the stupendous power of money from the	sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly	matches	the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawning	hands touch the outside of each elbow and rub	pip out of the shop	4686.7576294817645
2584. the respectability which money confers implies	a different etiquette and upon taking up the life of a london gentleman	pip must learn from herbert pocket that the spoon is not generally	used over-hand but under	5662.960899038207
2585. the following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the	operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items:	channel unit combined channel and unit combined arm and file unit	record synchronizers inquiry synchronizers and alteration switches	4335.496521976302
2586. the declarative operation equ is used to equate symbolic names	to item numbers	1175.9964210706914
2587. certain autocoder	statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained	in the operand of a single line on the autocoder	coding sheet	2459.3177829780507
2588. when this is the case the appropriate section of this	manual will indicate that continuation cards may be used	2575.7094818498013
2589. thus	when specifically permitted the operand of a given line on the autocoder	coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to	four additional lines which immediately follow	3343.900004890408
2590. the label and	operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand	must begin in column 21; ie it must be left-justified in the	operand column of the coding sheet	5161.577200222186
2591. the operand need not extend across	the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation	cards but may end with the comma following any parameter	2854.811294096612
2592. remarks may	appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they	are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces	4089.908999847293
2593. illustration	of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the	examples illustrating the various statements	1261.0904068466532
2594. if a continuation	card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards	the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message	3712.0672629210567
2595. additional	restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions	appear on page 106	939.475544314763
2596. electronic switches	the assignment of actual addresses to symbolic	index word and electronic switch names occurs in phase 3 of the	autocoder processor	3481.601588535097
2597. the initial availability of index words and electronic	switches is determined by a table which is included in the compiler	systems tape	2181.340770819352
2598. this table originally indicates that index words	1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for	assignment to symbolic references; index words 97 through 99 are	not available	4976.465177741637
2599. the initial setting of this table may be altered however	as described in the 70707074 data processing system bulletin	ibm 70707074 compiler system: operating procedure	form j28-6105	2847.4868253581203
2600. during the first pass of phase 3 references	to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches	are collected and the availability table is updated	4093.4623488470256
2601. at the end	of this pass the table indicates which index words and electronic switches	are not available for assignment to symbolic references	2308.7913833693665
2602. both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable	before the start of assignment in one of the following ways:	the initial setting of the availability table indicated that the	index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment	6563.471090970741
2603. the one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch	was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify	indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic	switch eg   the one- or two-digit number of	the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an equ	statement eg    when the index words or electronic	switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements	described above the position or order of the statements within the program	is not important; any such reference will make the index word	or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass	0.20124717349522497
2604. during	the assignment pass of phase 3 index words and electronic switches	are reserved as they are encountered during assignment	2819.5946377741134
2605. index	words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways	640.5496158344911
2606. the first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches;	the third applies only to index words	2614.616955521516
2607. during the assignment	pass each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic	name of an index word or electronic switch	2039.5764606060334
2608. when such a reference	is found an actual address is assigned and the availability table is	changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available	for later assignment	5189.926867412036
2609. if the one- or two-digit address of	an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand	of an xreserve or sreserve statement	the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved	3872.9225923389736
2610. if a statement has been assigned an address in the index word	area  by means of an	origin statement which refers to an actual address the	corresponding index word will be reserved	5176.183573602926
2611. these entries should normally	appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each	litorigin statement	1418.4217383278324
2612. otherwise symbolic names may have	previously been assigned to these same index words	1182.992061571395
2613. the preceding methods allow	efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized	or multi-phase program particularly when used in conjunction	with the litorigin statement	2862.117241162746
2614. extreme caution should	be used however to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic	switch which may result from the assignment of more than one	name or function to the same address	5657.0640803011875
2615. if the symbolic name or	actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included	in the operand of an xrelease or srelease	statement the specified index word or electronic switch	will again be made available regardless of the method by which it	was reserved	4843.6481755385375
2616. it will not however be used for symbolic assignment until	all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for	the first time	3684.985065176814
2617. if at any time during the assignment pass	the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment	the warning message no more index words available	will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered	to show that index words 1 through 96 are available and the assignment	will continue as before	5482.146329380621
2618. if the compiler finds that there are	no more electronic switches available for assignment the warning message	no more electronic switches available will be placed in	the object program listing the table will be altered to show that electronic	switches 1 through 30 are available and assignment will continue	as before	7556.512350949366
2619. the resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic	switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names	used eg through the proper use of the equ xrelease	or srelease statements	3541.484382507554
2620. as noted in appendix	c index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment	to symbolic names by the compiler; also index words 93 through	96 may have been made unavailable for assignment	5457.341647359668
2621. statements	autocoder declarative statements provide the processor	with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations	properly	1424.3414176772867
2622. declarative statements are never executed in the object program	and should be separated from the program instruction area placed	preferably at its beginning or end	3905.938212499812
2623. otherwise special care must be	taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute	something in a data area as an instruction	2856.214854305431
2624. if the compiler does	encounter such statements a warning message will be issued	1187.4139086872906
2625. 70707074	autocoder includes the following declarative statements: da	dc drdw	dsw dline	equ code dtf	diocs	and duf	1563.142636648745
2626. da dc	dtf and dline require more than one entry	562.2228756395509
2627. the da statement is used to name and define the positions and	length of fields within an area	1578.7917166425323
2628. the dc statement is used to name	and enter constants into the object program	1416.9452464360375
2629. since the 7070 and 7074	make use of record definition words to read write move	and otherwise examine blocks of storage the da and dc statements	provide the option of generating rdws automatically	3552.5784571867493
2630. when so instructed autocoder will generate one or more rdws	and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area	with which they are to be associated	4104.159321927963
2631. an rdw will be of the	form f where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy	is its ending location	2330.396480074464
2632. these addresses are calculated automatically	by the processor	251.95879075347585
2633. in some cases it may be more advantageous	to assign locations to rdws associated with da and dc	areas in some other part of storage ie not immediately preceding	the da or dc areas	3646.67516748913
2634. the drdw statement may be	used for this purpose	388.2757759089753
2635. the drdw statement may also be used to	generate an rdw defining any area specified by the programmer	1570.5641463457273
2636. as many as ten digital switches may be named and provided	by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and	logic macro-instructions	3483.838024007837
2637. each switch occupies one digit position	in a word can be set on or off and is considered	as logically equivalent to an electronic switch	2617.727669678253
2638. it cannot however	be referred to by electronic switch commands eg esn bsn	etc	1408.4972393386956
2639. an individual switch or the entire set of switches in	a word may be tested or altered as desired	1733.4264949286558
2640. through use of	the dline statement a means is provided for specifying both	the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout	of the area itself	5172.138354553277
2641. the area may include constant information supplied	by the programmer	376.33257259224445
2642. the area may also be provided with additional	data during the running of the object program by means of edmov	or move macro-instructions	3486.5486967719103
2643. the declarative statement	equ permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual	index words electronic switches arm and file numbers tape channel	and unit numbers alteration switches etc and to equate a symbol	to another symbol or to an actual address	4409.440191901405
2644. the diocs	dtf and duf statements are used when required by the inputoutput	control system	1640.6639163434295
2645. diocs is used to select the major	methods of processing to be used and to name the index words used	by iocs	2185.8486926225187
2646. each tape file must be described by tape file specifications	produced by dtfs	1180.8392719385088
2647. in addition to information related	to the file and its records the file specifications contain subroutine	locations and the location of tape label information	2465.765801487868
2648. a duf	entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type	of file and the unit record equipment to be used	3716.445496755473
2649. the duf also	supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are	unique to the file	1571.738958580096
2650. a full description of the diocs	dtf and duf statements is contained in the 7070 data processing	system bulletin ibm 7070 inputoutput control system	form j28-6033-1	4082.916285198016
2651. brief descriptions of these three declarative	statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions	of each of the other 70707074 autocoder declarative statements follow	below	2734.097249524934
2652. when	the inputoutput control system is to be used in a program a	diocs statement must be used to select the major methods of processing	to be used	4465.848077108401
2653. this statement also allows the naming of the index	words used by iocs	794.0047070728052
2654. the basic	format of the diocs statement is as follows:  anylabel	is any symbolic label; it may be omitted	2590.329260720361
2655. the entry diocs	must be written exactly as shown	261.9904815991651
2656. the first item in the	operand iocsixf is used to specify the first iocs index	word for programs using tape files	3056.9882496705136
2657. this item may be a symbolic	name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range	3-94	1891.334234499746
2658. if the first item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name	iocsixf will be assigned	1895.261365816185
2659. when an actual index word or a	symbolic address is specified autocoder will equate the name iocsixf	to it	1741.2019866406197
2660. the second item in the operand iocsixg	is used to specify the second iocs index word for programs	using tape files	3043.8085904337854
2661. this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit	or two-digit index word address in the range 3-94	1891.334234499746
2662. if the second	item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name iocsixg	will be assigned	1890.0800224332918
2663. when an actual index word or a symbolic address	is specified autocoder will equate iocsixg to it	1419.1376419719359
2664. in the midwest oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment	of domestic sewage from suburban areas	2134.7621912352897
2665. the high cost of land	and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have	created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational	characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat	more organic matter per unit volume	4486.489292135952
2666. research at fayette missouri	on oxidation ponds has shown that the bod in the treated	effluent varied from 30 to 53 mgl with loadings from 8 to	120 lb boddayacre	4837.554465600995
2667. since experience indicates that effluents	from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these bod	concentrations the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated	treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds	3883.1389361816073
2668. recent studies by weston and stack had indicated that a turbine	aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen	transfer	4079.7525985955735
2669. their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3	to 4 lb of oxygenhrhp	1089.5134726404106
2670. o'connor and eckenfelder	discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes	1178.552075413382
2671. they indicated that a 4-day retention aerated lagoon would give 60	to 76 per cent bod reduction	1425.0138208798958
2672. later eckenfelder increased	the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer	months	2349.1548848750294
2673. it appeared from the limited information available that the	aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity	of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree	of treatment in a smaller volume	3982.5648555730745
2674. with	the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city	missouri the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate	sewage disposal	3897.6482899745897
2675. the sewage system from kansas city was not	expected to serve the red bridge area for several years	1570.13489855936
2676. this necessitated	the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with	an expected life from 5 to 15 yr	2364.765020368045
2677. for the initial development an	oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1	942.8104565748193
2678. the oxidation pond	has a surface area of 4	392.6572725865602
2679. 77 acres and a depth of 4 ft	167.3076078889667
2680. the pond	is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre	962.8557056417751
2681. in the summer	of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted	obnoxious odors	1105.207566449196
2682. it was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the	pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased	and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae	4804.800092832558
2683. the anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond	necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen	than by sodium nitrate	2024.9627207557278
2684. at the same time further expansion in the	red bridge subdivision required the construction of additional sewage	treatment facilities	2594.134186733761
2685. the large land areas required for oxidation	ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer	1569.3302184617833
2686. it was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the	problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary	treatment for the additional development	4316.373367903205
2687. the lack	of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer	to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility	for treating domestic sewage	3000.9467560280405
2688. the pilot plant was a circular lagoon	81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom	4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121000 gal	5338.507933759216
2689. the	side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to	prevent erosion	936.3669109331701
2690. the pilot lagoon was located as shown in figure 1	to serve the area just south of the existing housing area	3055.4324209072615
2691. the major	contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system	as the subdivision developed	1582.5537711055017
2692. the pilot lagoon was designed to handle	the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period	2124.0076841190144
2693. initially	the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the	domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period	2195.9018777599786
2694. this	operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly	increasing load over a reasonable period of time	2824.920964558126
2695. the pilot	plant was equipped with a 3-hp turbine aerator	375.07118941165066
2696. the	aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range	of speeds	1420.8868976171816
2697. the sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and	continuously recorded on 24-hr charts	1098.3995106229063
2698. the raw sewage was introduced	directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the	raw sewage with the aeration tank contents	3491.891678215533
2699. the effluent was collected	through two pipes and discharged to the blue river through a surface	drainage ditch	1573.058024758135
2700. composite samples were collected at	weekly intervals	140.50509114575775
2701. the long retention period and the complete mixing	concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent	2034.7386236268067
2702. weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible	than daily samples	949.7198858282609
2703. the composite samples were normally collected	over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite was made	1415.6224191506267
2704. examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation	of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr operations	2354.76621468053
2705. the	data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr composites was	essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load	2021.2896772612708
2706. grab samples	were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its	operating conditions	1419.0084674855643
2707. efforts were made to take the grab samples at	random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr	composite sample	2594.0758425358704
2708. a single 24-hr composite sample indicated that the	sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical	1643.3349471008726
2709. operations	the bod of the influent to the pilot plant varied	between 110 and 710 mgl with an average of 350 mgl	2177.7306472102296
2710. this was equivalent to 240 mglbod on a 24-hr basis	559.9409404711012
2711. the	bod of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a	subdivision	947.4440767146004
2712. the bod in the effluent averaged 58 mgl a 76-per	cent reduction over the 24-hr period	1877.0454094902202
2713. examination of the data	in table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent	bod	1567.3999174479873
2714. the periods of high effluent bod occurred during	cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted	2123.2689397688478
2715. ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts	375.44180967273326
2716. the	slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce	oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage	3919.3964156186835
2717. the	organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of bodday or about	2 lb bodday1000 cu ft aeration capacity	1887.403260415337
2718. needless	to say the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis but was	270 lb boddayacre on a surface loading basis	3476.1745505224835
2719. it seems that	the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly	loaded activated sludge system	1896.8984995921492
2720. the flow rate remained relatively	constant during the winter months as shown in table 1	1643.7032115413429
2721. with	the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open	sewers	941.2033099639086
2722. as construction progresses the volume of storm drainage will	be sharply reduced	962.1106646715383
2723. the retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged	from 9	377.28746293740517
2724. 6 days averaging 6	4.462847317279411
2725. the large amount	of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center	created a suspended solids problem	1728.9953863919648
2726. the vegetables were not readily metabolized	by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on	the surface	2821.985310558149
2727. a skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of	most of these light solids	1097.3556684092628
2728. the average volatile suspended solids in	the effluent was 75 mgl while mlss averaged 170 mgl	volatile suspended solids	2564.7443612374523
2729. the average sludge age based on displacement	of solids was calculated to be 14	938.3516216653934
2730. the oxygen uptake rate	in the mixed liquor averaged 0	560.3280189643531
2731. 8 mglhr during the first	four months of this study	373.7462246209271
2732. variations in aerator speeds during the latter	two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen	demand	2590.4172395891414
2733. the increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1	167.9603499513425
2734. 6 mglhr	which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to	be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower	rotor speeds	4089.9785699233203
2735. it appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids	were active microbial solids with the heavier less active solids	settling out	2167.653291959709
2736. the suspended solids discharged in the effluent	were found to be the major source of the bod	2119.611748646719
2737. removal of the suspended	solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing	only 20 mgl bod	1572.2787800286671
2738. the bod in the drainage ditch	receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mgl	1409.98278383239
2739. this low bod	was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation	since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during	this study	2978.7733895611846
2740. routine microscopic examinations	were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by mckinney and	gram for the various types of protozoa	3045.8028367192705
2741. it was found that the	aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation	pond	1419.0184186411695
2742. at no time were algae found in the mixed liquor	558.3402963637903
2743. the bacteria	formed typical activated sludge floc	94.73467946769415
2744. the floc particles were all small	as the heavier floc settled out	960.1469428698931
2745. initially the flagellated	protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated	protozoa	1257.5785459746126
2746. as the temperature decreased the number of free swimming	ciliated protozoa decreased	970.1056580707478
2747. very little protozoa activity existed	below 40`f	94.15721947879476
2748. when the temperature reached 32`f all protozoan	activity ceased; but as the temperature rose the numbers of	protozoa increased rapidly	2821.888324056189
2749. only once were stalked ciliates found in	the mixed liquor	374.8191906706735
2750. the predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa	is indicative of a high bacterial population	1424.2373515324211
2751. one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen	transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator	1715.0854561188037
2752. routine determinations	were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen	uptake rates	1880.9640848084969
2753. the data given in table 2 show the routine operation	of the aerator	790.681496984346
2754. the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently	high until january 29 1961	1411.1707299972243
2755. an extended cold spell caused	ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform	and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water	3216.686755784717
2756. the added	resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen	transfer capacity	1895.2131853552473
2757. it was approximately one month before the belt	problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency	of dissolved oxygen	2461.7399356974033
2758. a series of eight special tests were	conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer	rate	2349.8594534228955
2759. five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to	simulate an ice cover	1095.242744510059
2760. the rate of oxygen transfer at 1	140.56145789045232
2761. 0-mgl	dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`c for various rotor speeds	is given in table 3	1099.2801387888185
2762. the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1	249.3783056728426
2763. 0	mgl dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lbday at a maximum	rate of 9	1093.345178455657
2764. the actual power requirements indicated	2lb oxygen transferhrhp	249.34706352201124
2765. the polyethylene cover reduced	the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum	oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface	2860.033695523303
2766. pond	during this study septic conditions developed in the	oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted	2358.7636617880808
2767. shortly after this	study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of	sodium nitrate	1096.773532336201
2768. the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value	residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer	2834.489859253073
2769. the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from	160 to 270 mgl of bod with an average of 230 mgl	2170.8051990303215
2770. the bod data are given in table 4	249.49833994954642
2771. a single 24-hr composite	sample had a bod of 260 mgl indicating a typical	domestic sewage	1266.435374616837
2772. the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged	147000 gpd giving a retention period of 42 days	2346.926503451853
2773. the organic	loading on the pond was slightly under 60lbboddayacre	375.1972829943751
2774. the effluent bod averaged 34 mgl a little lower	than that of the study at fayette indicated for a loading of 60lb	boddayacre	3460.1544398272335
2775. the bod of the effluent ranged from a	minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47mgl	1253.5961899851443
2776. microscopic examination of	the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began	to decrease with cold weather	2587.623687699493
2777. when the algae began to build up	again the effluent bod rose	638.5994120271217
2778. during the two weeks when the algae	disappeared from the effluent bod's in the effluent were 18	and 16 mgl	2808.2674688537195
2779. thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations	are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense	1874.434360827951
2780. the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and	near terminals and bases	1414.7507211261045
2781. to effect these operations five elements	exist	fixed installations	261.29116560645633
2782. surface forces have been used to provide defense	zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area	surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas	4291.461880141232
2783. submarines and	shore installations are new elements	93.33175577889295
2784. the submarine now has a definite	place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to	ocean areas	2356.672769055938
2785. fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection	93.98684951763386
2786. mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets	248.87148356206916
2787. a sixth element not always considered is intelligence	167.4493870442147
2788. it includes	operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment	967.5867169071989
2789. operational intelligence presumably will be available from our	national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will	come from the recently augmented program in oceanography	2479.8446319787354
2790. the major	postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be	considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting	3491.4542269948133
2791. thinking on submarine defense	has not always been clear-cut	261.25876550058746
2792. proponents of single elements tend	to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified	and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents	has assumed the greatest importance	5163.635179738834
2793. consequently air surface	and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations	and intelligence	792.6158718438093
2794. these have sought more and more of what they have	560.1360397614715
2795. each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others	644.3693940640458
2796. this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are	necessarily mutually supporting	960.5263489167471
2797. thus the most productive areas are	not necessarily the most stressed	503.17038794678604
2798. this is stated to emphasize the necessity	for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would	provide positions of relative importance to asw elements based on	projected potentialities	4638.535602800668
2799. then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements	can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common	objective	1731.4869873848406
2800. an over-all concept would have other advantages	141.16420713589864
2801. it would	allow presentation to the public of a unified approach	503.7206271900062
2802. now the problem	is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily	392.52626537422975
2803. while one	element	is announcing progress another is delineating its problems	502.0904873614484
2804. the	result can only be confusion in the public mind	565.7522340925594
2805. a unified concept	can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will	command congressional support	1898.5670501998557
2806. industry's main criticism of the	navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any	one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how	3905.8407725448255
2807. lacking guidance	industry picks its own areas	94.00625090316598
2808. the result coupled with the salesmanship	for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure	of funds and efforts in marginal areas	3267.0480083780812
2809. an over-all concept	will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield	greatest dividends	1105.095705067829
2810. therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine	defense is needed for co-ordination of the navy's efforts for a logical	presentation to the public for industry's guidance and as a	basis for a program to the congress	5784.760537372723
2811. concept	that which follows will be a discussion of principles	and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare	1882.4573499378905
2812. russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided	between her various fleets	1405.4666432638069
2813. some are also in albania and others	are on loan to egypt	642.6218782757603
2814. other countries which may willingly or unwillingly	become communist can furnish bases	966.4472173405165
2815. communist target areas can	be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide	with soviet intentions	1567.8943917190186
2816. attack can come from almost any direction against	many locations	557.8852110687076
2817. logically then the first principle of the plan	must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area	1872.6286411453216
2818. it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while	building at bases in transit and on station	2570.6240941054402
2819. destruction of the enemy's	building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy	territory which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities	2323.049277341163
2820. in	transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines	until commission of an overt act	2798.7622947860414
2821. the communists are adept at utilizing	hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is	to their advantage	2040.0549157872094
2822. therefore the second principle of the plan must be	that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is	not dependent on general war	3477.123786286074
2823. antisubmarine warfare does not involve	clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result	of a single battle	1724.2115356503996
2824. it is a war of attrition of single actions	of an exchange of losses	1406.0772370312977
2825. this exchange must result in our ending up	with some effective units	645.0266770237255
2826. initially having fewer units of some elements-	especially submarines- than the opponent our capabilities need	to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will	be in our favor	4840.503336287018
2827. therefore the third principle of the plan must be that	it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types	unless at an assured favorable exchange rate	3098.189109137731
2828. the submarine	has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since	world war 2	1648.1373485464756
2829. its speed has increased it operates at increasingly	greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and	it will become even more silent	2336.63910642666
2830. the next developments will probably	be in weaponry	251.0256589039805
2831. the missile can gradually be expected to replace the	torpedo	375.27741751016384
2832. as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to	attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges	2352.342638848463
2833. therefore	the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously	increasing capabilities in the opponent	1726.6211968890336
2834. no element can accomplish	the total objective of submarine defense	558.0275054941895
2835. some elements support	the others	but all have limitations	260.4492347012345
2836. some limitations of one element	can be compensated for by a capability of another	1410.666811718378
2837. elements used	in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum	of the capabilities of the individual elements	1889.0479031045184
2838. therefore the plan's	fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of	all elements in combination	2351.654095570882
2839. conceivably the submarine defense	problem can be solved by sufficient forces	505.5044087822069
2840. numbers would be astronomical	and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution	1174.9640813066276
2841. shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that	there will not be enough of anything	1089.0770783357232
2842. therefore any measures taken	in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute	greatly to success when hostilities occur	3029.952130736779
2843. therefore the sixth	principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures	which will reduce future force requirements	2017.6271701140915
2844. the world is constantly	changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today	955.2434283238948
2845. the	seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough	to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and	changes in world conditions	2597.4167321668933
2846. to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense	has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles	delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed	5190.545578040659
2847. before considering these elements in more detail an additional	requirement should be stated	795.7025804315905
2848. large area coverage will accomplish all	other tasks	248.34068901481388
2849. therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction	of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage	1723.919915549719
2850. but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented	geographically	1184.8810926713763
2851. consequently the system giving area coverage	must be flexible and hence at least	partially mobile	1099.697101576242
2852. since effective area coverage appears fairly remote	the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements:	air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence	4118.883738984479
2853. these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness	of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order	in the hope that the true order of importance will result	3426.0547964677235
2854. intelligence	as used herein will include information on possible	opponents and on the environment which can affect operations	2359.8380312952486
2855. these can	be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence	504.05022078451304
2856. in submarine defense these must have maximum stress	250.12553321446384
2857. good operational	intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force	requirements	and increase tactical effectiveness	1099.9717397022846
2858. environmental intelligence	is just as important	65.5149581797016
2859. the ocean presently co-operates with the	target	93.50495034740635
2860. full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the	environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of	equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development	of methods of capitalizing on the environment	6193.388400960584
2861. therefore improved	intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as	it supports all other elements rates a top priority	1885.8999135448807
2862. gathering intelligence	is important but of equal importance is its translation into	usable form	1410.7036681725695
2863. a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic	research into tactical and operating instructions	1259.3041969865567
2864. approaching	this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent	has the same sources available and will be encountered not under	average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him	5333.592243944147
2865. therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating	instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time	of encounter	2171.3800612921405
2866. all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage	then	390.22530393251475
2867. temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and	animal life are the chief environmental variables	1106.1514858144853
2868. variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature	because more of the variables would be encompassed	2356.144078977844
2869. these variations	must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically	503.15753790019335
2870. progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little	guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information	3461.123873060905
2871. a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on	the spot	791.0028457678357
2872. mine warfare has in the past been directed against	surface targets	756.0707246830386
2873. by its nature it has always been of great psychological	advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater	counter-efforts	1727.2746195597106
2874. mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine	targets	249.72818685747848
2875. they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters	however and targets must come within a few yards of them	2164.8735589524517
2876. mines	need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment	extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit	increased	3903.126711980693
2877. mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they	are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and	can be put into place quickly	2965.970588126952
2878. a most attractive feature is that detection	and attack are combined in a single package	1647.4045790718974
2879. effective employment	will reduce force requirements	43.62112532052739
2880. for example effective mine	barriers from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from	cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense	inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for	the entire gulf of mexico	6322.243892570967
2881. more extended systems covering all passage	into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico	from the previously listed requirements	2342.1958552048063
2882. systems covering the gulf	of st lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the united	states are not impossible	2591.737926668928
2883. such mine defense systems could permit concentration	of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase	in the probability of success	2170.159205808371
2884. the advantages inherent in mine warfare	justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any	of the other elements	3268.5118851417524
2885. fixed installations are increasingly	advocated as the problem of area defense emerges	641.5561631048125
2886. the proponents	are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence	on their military counterparts	1647.2166826696598
2887. systems which detect submarines over	wide areas are attractive although they can be only burglar alarms	1258.4600433720852
2888. mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets	since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target	2804.6590627431488
2889. such systems	are expensive and are oriented geographically	166.4578576415233
2890. in an over-all	asw concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems	should be limited to those with proven capabilities	3041.7320737161
2891. no general installation	should be made until a model installation has been proved and	its maximum capability determined	1575.420617663646
2892. in addition proposals for fixed installations	should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile	system	1650.7157102467713
2893. for fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that	should be inherent in naval systems	1090.556636973331
2894. the submarine has become	increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system	758.3989910215871
2895. it operates	in its target's environment and any advantage gained therefrom	by the target is shared by the attacker	1727.9696332734736
2896. but the submarine is a weapon	of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed	1888.4703101832395
2897. two metabolites	which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast	bacteria are biosynthesized from paba	1570.3158440290567
2898. the 7 carbons of paba	are incorporated directly into metabolite 2		393.31948130359507
2899. thirty-five of the 36	carbon atoms arise from paba	261.96368703986315
2900. all 28 carbons of metabolite 1	arise from paba	392.8364313023116
2901. metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower specific	activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite	1736.1594756375248
2902. vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the	biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines	2363.7855133420053
2903. fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt	and free base	1109.6787038132875
2904. preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the	molecule is cleaved at a secondary amide bond	1418.3161467494497
2905. h sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation	- research	on esterases in mammalian sera was continued	985.3646435744442
2906. one of the most interesting	findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to	rare earth ions	2112.6698687055014
2907. the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations	of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect	of rare earth salts	2321.0909110007974
2908. various metal ions have been found to protect plasma	arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine	1874.941000441178
2909. the effects	can be related to the structure of this -sh enzyme	637.9250891804977
2910. the non-identity	of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established	953.441669929635
2911. furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian	sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin	in addition to arylesterase	2444.678894079745
2912. selective inhibitors can	distinguish the two activities	140.87117725669378
2913. investigations on the acceleration of	human plasma cholinesterase were carried further	498.3129602090855
2914. biophysical studies on	- electron-microscopical and physical-chemical	methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured	collagen and ribonucleic acid	1648.5347970979
2915. a method	was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen		262.2876235445891
2916. it was observed that ewc macromolecules are the	same diameter than	vertebrate tropocollagen	1184.0437940773656
2917. this unusual collagen also was shown to undergo	a reversible thermal phase transformation	792.3321134180609
2918. this investigation	involved several aspects	22.215333655296835
2919. substance z an active urinary	peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated	column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography	were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological	effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo	on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering	respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles	under various conditions was developed by the instruments section	; and enzymes	which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps	substance z were studied	0.20124717349522497
2920. experiments are in progress to develop	ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes	and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions	3042.093322101863
2921. c d mackey a g renfrew w b severs	- in a physiochemical study	of seed proteins the globulins of the brazil nut have been investigated	1804.829039798872
2922. in addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three	other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed	1882.2109858656943
2923. a	water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight has	also been found in this system and partly characterized	1575.0840549338784
2924. on the basis of	a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove	that for materials having the property that the stress is given by	a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical	theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation	has been infinitesimal for all times in the past	7968.671811836257
2925. by strengthening	the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second	and higher order theories of viscoelasticity	1570.18880541095
2926. in the second-order	theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the	first-order stress relaxation function	2616.338996998635
2927. an extensive series of	measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum	instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation free vibration and	creep measurements over the temperature range of f to 80`c	3543.3812075232613
2928. as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally	1185.351356469257
2929. the simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous	systems did not hold here	783.8718111862047
2930. it was possible however to decompose	the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two	viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the boltzmann superposition	principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence	factors	5640.4055145200455
2931. and related	- the results of microanalysis of tektites	for gallium and germanium have shown that	these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial	matter by impact of a celestial body	2254.7323079355515
2932. the galliumgermanium	ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary	matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components	of the tektite	4099.980021200668
2933. gallium oxide is less volatile than silica	and germanium oxide is more volatile	792.1544010729119
2934. australites	give the appearance of a second	melting	249.33478630965928
2935. in conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium	content was found in the portion that has undergone a second	melting	2031.2385567345268
2936. the silicate fractions of stony meteorites show galliumgermanium	ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone	melting at some point in their histories	4078.8259806184624
2937. libyan desert silica-glass	another natural glass is composed of nearly pure silica	and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area	2470.6308233667246
2938. the gallium	content however has been enhanced five-fold	250.90394076019635
2939. this glass is probably	formed from libyan desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite	impact	942.9050983616441
2940. nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy	to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only	small quantities of material	2584.2966955891743
2941. most of the impact energy is spent	in crushing and fragmentation	503.8124902433886
2942. when rapid quenching follows melting	impact glasses may result	393.76173573808575
2943. these always contain metallic inclusions	14.982563634433436
2944. impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been	produced by stony meteorites or comets	1639.2805750905452
2945. no meteorites have ever been	recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing	impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception	of aouelloul crater adrar western sahara desert	3422.691393955195
2946. this	crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic	material has been recovered	1892.9987371458599
2947. preparation of a coordination compound is often	accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a	ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol	2994.897321065823
2948. by applying this general	principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium	iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine	and triphenylstibine	have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few	years	5316.9311330872415
2949. in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary decomposition of	solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were	not considered following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in	preparative coordination chemistry	3541.299892643842
2950. recent work with radiocarbon and	deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido	and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction	with alcohol in some of these systems	4982.900545484701
2951. some of the previously reported	compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and	carbonyl compounds discovered the more representative examples being	f f f f and f	3333.805908145944
2952. the coordination complexes	formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and	arsines are being investigated	2122.149986444114
2953. particular interest	is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal	halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes	1897.4152601881674
2954. during the	past year these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes	of nickel and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged	complexes of palladium as well as new compounds	of the well-known type f	5182.265084130889
2955. the structures properties and reactions	of these compounds are being studied	503.4104132872243
2956. in another study	chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared	homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized	and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view	to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed	under varying preparative conditions	6352.982962254285
2957. _elasticity	- the theory of elasticity of	gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the	equations of state relating variables of pressure volume temperature	stress and strain have been precisely formulated	2765.708694431959
2958. simple elongation	has been treated in detail	140.76551455302894
2959. the various stress-temperature coefficients	for constancy of volume and strain constancy of pressure and strain	and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated	2453.4341872731043
2960. the	dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy	of compressibility have been related to the elongation	2119.936276798827
2961. in continuation	of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of	the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought	1886.8481714873883
2962. chain conformations of polymeric	- recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions	of polymeric chains by volkenstein and lifson has been extended to include	more general types of chains	3219.3048943950307
2963. the mean-square end-to-end distance	of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement	with values deduced from viscosity data	1886.183477237192
2964. these studies are being	extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the	hindrances to rotation around chain bonds	2811.9735444499015
2965. the crystallization of copolymers comprising f units interspersed	with a minor percentage of f is limited by the inability of the	crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky	side group of the latter	3857.562322211448
2966. only uninterrupted sequences of the former	are eligible for formation of crystallites	955.4899957879877
2967. limitations on the lengths	of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short	crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening	of the melting range	3212.6759578623796
2968. carefully executed melting studies on this system	permit quantitative estimation of the instability	engendered by reduced crystallite length	2349.8602294555376
2969. the complex morphology of	polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor	788.1366906024856
2970. hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations	in the latter field	1421.2940044275367
2971. glycerinated	muscle in the presence of the physiological agent	262.7667213147875
2972. responsible	for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins	of muscle has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive	both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of	alcohols and water	5635.302738078861
2973. experiments carried out over long periods of time	in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the	onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of	several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several	per cent	4668.785339874613
2974. the contraction therefore partakes of the character of	a phase transition	755.0980383903212
2975. while atp appears to be necessary for the	occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it	by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction	3229.094003952877
2976. one of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques	is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight	distribution	2814.4993329418294
2977. a simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse	polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed	1416.401770299292
2978. the preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore	employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental	skill and starting materials of a high purity	4276.563853041409
2979. in the new process	impurities present in the solvent the monomer and in the	reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers	are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of	initiator a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium at	a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth	4936.696947170639
2980. upon completion	of the purging step additional initiator appropriate for the molecular	weight of the sample desired is added and the system is then warmed	to the polymerization temperature at which the reaction is allowed	to go to completion	6197.273871238893
2981. the predictability of the molecular weights was	found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared with f ratios less	than 1	2171.1476868470772
2982. contrary to observations with ethers no apparent	change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable	periods of time in benzene as solvent	4075.011779720545
2983. in this publication measurements of interfacial	angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances	1408.85507471165

3091. all crystalline	substances and other solid-state materials	94.42877154283507
3092. the	aim is to collect a very broad range of physical chemical morphological	and structural data for crystals on an encyclopedic scale and to	seek all possible useful and revealing correlations of properties with	internal structure	5762.41063713869
3093. the first stage of operation	has centered on the literature imaging of critical or summarizing	tabulations such as the barker index	2038.45872582518

3096. critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this	project	1415.259054297249
3097. however the proposed correlation of the many interrelated	properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data	and suggest areas for reinvestigation	2302.8715829116218
3098. in addition the availability	of computers will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural	information	1633.8120258251943
3099. physical	for punched-card or tape storage of information all	literature values must be conformed to a common language	1560.1426258261536
3100. in this	way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbols and units will be	realized	1657.4226168358691
3101. because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements	for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years	involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration	fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and	freezing	4141.549471197206
3102. the basic objectives in each instance are to make available	supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter	to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and	insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of	harvest or production to areas of consumption	7403.655218263161
3103. in earlier years	the preservation of food was essentially related to survival	640.5173821056085
3104. in	the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations food-preservation	techniques have sought also to bring variety peak freshness	and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the	comsumer	5175.058557863959
3105. with the development of nuclear technology isotopic	materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities	of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted	the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout	the world	4142.786355864066
3106. an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate	answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled	2572.2516621021477
3107. interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve	as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses	and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or	without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations	4306.358386323336
3108. the chief	factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are microorganisms	such as bacteria molds and yeasts insects	sprouting and chemical reactions	3507.766891532277
3109. microorganisms are often	responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods	372.8478965022251
3110. of special concern is	the growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum which generate	poisonous products	1884.6841444885188
3111. enzymatic action in stored food produces changes	which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability	1573.0961801641079
3112. spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group	of components in the food with others or with its environment as in	corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with	oxygen in the air to produce rancidity	6816.149342229973
3113. sprouting is a naturally	occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets	and similar root vegetables	1260.1739953779731
3114. insect infestation is a problem of importance	chiefly in stored grain	755.8517942539447
3115. the presence of parasitic organisms	such as trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which	must be dealt with in food processing	2169.4993035551283
3116. to permit the storage	of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish	the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic	action	4070.1014127984117
3117. the term sterilization applies to methods involving essentially	complete destruction of all microorganisms	780.6471607000504
3118. food treated in	this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging	and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without	refrigeration	3883.59869244113
3119. the process of pasteurization involves milder	and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction	of most but not all of the microorganisms	2310.4452637537406
3120. less severe thermal	treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes	1185.2695862835033
3121. effects of ionizing radiation	ionizing radiation can cause	the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage	or at lower doses can inhibit their action	2740.0364024169503
3122. it furnishes a means	of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic	organisms present in meats	2834.855774199074
3123. deactivation of enzymes is also	possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad	or more	1585.0402051971482
3124. because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally	low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude	the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation	by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching	5481.874251160019
3125. radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food	262.31496163077
3126. it will	however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables	964.6797413659149
3127. the radiation doses required for the preservation of foods	are in the following ranges:  for radiosterilization to destroy	all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4	2586.925403882522
3128. 5 mrad for	nonacid foods of low salt content	391.07008264792313
3129. for radiopasteurization	to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food	storage conditions and objectives of treatment- commonly of the	order of 0	2458.9971718224515
3130. 2 mrads but up to about 0	141.02175197143006
3131. for	destruction of insects- about 25000 rads	94.19013509978272
3132. for inhibiting	the sprouting of root vegetables- 4000 to 10000 rads	751.599156101869
3133. preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side	effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages	1418.5590793733943
3134. in this respect	the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized	foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with	fresh and commercially processed foods	4650.326654811814
3135. a number of foods are quite	acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially	less than sterilization levels	1889.7258459270827
3136. moreover the nutritive value	of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although	some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization	doses	3694.397268850279
3137. for irradiation of food the results	obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation	and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable	2864.506046820599
3138. aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain	practical advantages; for example gamma rays give deeper penetration	but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron	beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the	food package to be irradiated	7031.168910206546
3139. selection of a source for commercial irradiation	would involve consideration of numerous factors including required	dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most	important costs	2717.896456344606
3140. of the potentially useful sources of ionizing	radiations gamma sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products	or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium	salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems	5626.593178114628
3141. of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines resonant	transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available	for commercial use	2332.3266574384206
3142. costs of the effective energy produced	by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation	processes	2602.9437079241734
3143. estimated production costs of radiation energy	from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per kwhr	1581.3312024707643
3144. conventional	energy for processing foods is available in the range of	at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent	of a few mills per kwhr for process steam	5310.210703655101
3145. radiation therefore is	at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as	much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization	or radiosterilization	3138.792944571932
3146. what are the possibilities of lowered radiation	production costs for the future	963.9302164842178
3147. it has been estimated that for	applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood	of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for	gamma radiation generated in a reactor core	3754.0571179356302
3148. no comparable reductions	in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen	754.4577857453921
3149. such projections however	appear highly	speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond	those foreseen for food-preservation facilities	1577.5068524074798
3150. because agricultural	activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest	of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of	the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance	to a central processing location the use of large central processing	stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt	range might be utilized is inherently impracticable	8183.6233547980955
3151. of irradiation preservation of foods	the objective of complete	sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product	capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods	of time	3333.767537612409
3152. chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military	services	391.62862493143405
3153. for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency	conditions is a paramount consideration	947.346746480786
3154. they require completely	sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably	items already cooked and ready to eat	2578.9088092914144
3155. high nutritional value variety	palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons	of morale	937.9761618050941
3156. foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration	are also of interest	1409.1367528227684
3157. of primary interest are meats	14.944964191564136
3158. radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes	in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping	qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items	3697.228205070286
3159. thus food so processed	might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more	produce at peak freshness and palatability	2191.4273164216443
3160. commercial interest is chiefly	in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime	conditions	1887.3723461883576
3161. the present status of food preservation by ionizing	radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs	1568.704246098728
3162. the radiation processing of meat has received extensive	investigation	393.383635098573
3163. to date the one meat showing favorable results at	sterilization doses is pork	788.6020567361365
3164. of particular interest to the military	services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization	is superior in palatability to available canned pork products	3689.742679742542
3165. tests	with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development	of off-flavors	787.1871733782663
3166. a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps	program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means	of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item	5156.988997857762
3167. partly	because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes	before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of	boiled or canned meat	2317.1499345974303
3168. off-flavor is a less severe problem with	the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability	remain	2115.9241527193453
3169. moderate radiation doses of from 100000 to 200000 rads	can extend the shelf life of fresh beef from 5 days	to 5 or 6 weeks	2603.8918986920316
3170. however the problem of consumer acceptability remains	140.7287306738896
3171. the preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef	and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts	943.3779636378183
3172. cooked beef irradiated in	the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color	1178.1450045257102
3173. when lamb	and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes	dehydrated the fat become chalky and again unnatural changes in	color occur	2463.9360929985764
3174. ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger	have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization	might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping	qualities	4476.722747873101
3175. however a major problem here is one of scale of processing;	ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local	level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require	central processing and distribution facilities	3957.6906112028455
3176. the problems of	color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are	the same as for solid cuts	2823.2480363906134
3177. specialty cooked items containing	meat portions as in frozen dinners might offer a potential use	for radiopasteurization	1417.0507123894452
3178. the principal potential advantage would be	that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost	under refrigeration instead of being frozen	3712.5450715524958
3179. a refrigerated item	could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen	foods of the same type	2175.452475794291
3180. competitive processes for preserving	meats are by canning and freezing	566.2566112451732
3181. costs of canning meat are in the	range of 0	371.89218763600536
3182. 8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area	of 2 to 3	2118.8568748958305
3183. the table on page 10 shows costs of canning	and freezing meat and estimated costs for irradiation under certain	assumed conditions	2038.151286038168
3184. under the conditions of comparison it will	radiosterilization is more	radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137	irradiation	using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator	5183.900121860696
3185. results of irradiation tests with poultry have	been quite successful	374.0002974278896
3186. at sterilizing doses good palatability results	with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor	1887.0795650648677
3187. radiopasteurization	has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken	can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared	with about 10 days for the untreated product	3459.2386007564505
3188. acceptable taste and	odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken	965.4924081238263
3189. acceptance	of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two	reasons: the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration	is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation	and distributing practices and treatment by antibiotics a measure	already approved by the federal food and drug administration	serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0	5672.990093112081
3190. fresh seafood products are extremely	perishable	65.76599191200023
3191. although refrigeration has served to extend the storage	life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible	if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately	3000.282451641553
3192. furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms	possible	969.9370310530473
3193. the instrument is shown in fig 1 and consists	essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed	along the substrate to remove the coating	2855.7027637835586
3194. the force required to accomplish	removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against	distance of removal	2353.0727792428575
3195. since the removal force is a function of coating	thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into	the instrument to accurately measure film thickness	2614.9126016507985
3196. this too is	recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously	cut	1881.8735919363494
3197. a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer	to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited	on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and	plastic surfaces	3547.5820431311477
3198. the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily	be carried out	958.5563889786906
3199. hesiometer results have been found to compare	excellently with manual knife scratching tests	784.7078257098349
3200. the instrumental	method however is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical	results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time	4098.0455710077895
3201. if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from	a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant	rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed	which depend upon the thickness of the coating	4306.116683429611
3202. at low thicknesses a	cutting phenomenon is often encountered	394.0894293332641
3203. as the coating	becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of	failure	1251.3218132582963
3204. if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure	finally can occur	1179.888251544129
3205. the typical appearance of these various mechanisms	is illustrated in figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements	of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal	process	3560.0288168220272
3206. it can be seen from fig 2 that the cutting removal	of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the	coating	3692.5407200759864
3207. the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are	obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and	failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife	and extending to the coating surface	4225.612316114286
3208. the pictures of figs	3 and	4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating	is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between	coating and substrate	5652.269113931872
3209. if the force required to remove the	coatings is plotted against film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically	in fig 5 may characteristically result	2457.962562300342
3210. here h	is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the	substrate and t is the film thickness	3057.134322027955
3211. it can be seen that	the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly	from cutting to cracking to peeling removal	2331.471833839967
3212. also it can be readily	seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state	response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature	4484.820369631098
3213. it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the	same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of	changes in coatings thickness	2976.09320428734
3214. presumably the interfacial bond strength	and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case	1410.9995967953105
3215. what then	are the factors that contribute to these phenomena	376.37611232021453
3216. why should	the practical adhesion of a coating as assessed by a knife method	change initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise	to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing	thickness	6060.192877111462
3217. the	cutting removal process has been previously described	167.62390797656843
3218. it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely	by cohesive failure	1636.7247848078132
3219. the details of the removal process are shown	schematically in fig 6	646.0173986137291
3220. the various forces result from the reaction	of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along	the shear plane which makes an angle |f with the substrate	5030.830809497641
3221. the	action and reaction forces are r and f respectively and	are equal and opposite in direction	1419.2569653776222
3222. all the other force vectors are	derived from these	397.6541659629212
3223. f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness	t from the substrate	1094.3705013443914
3224. f is the shear force along the shear	plane; f and f are the thrust forces acting against coating	and knife respectively; f is the normal compressive force acting	on the shear plane; f is the friction force between chip and knife	surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the	knife	8048.073982260119
3225. |a is the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle	the shear plane makes with the substrate; |t is the friction	angle; and |b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of	the substrate	4060.6015617737007
3226. an analysis of the vector relationships shows	that the rake angle |a and the friction angle |t determine	the vector direction f of the force resultants r and f	4669.935868556115
3227. consequently	both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction	occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the	knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting	removal process	4224.628713745838
3228. it is difficult to measure the direction	and magnitude of r directly	964.7475346960842
3229. in actual practice the values most	readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force f and the	shear angle |f	1889.5479009210653
3230. these two values and the rake angle |a are	sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships	2363.621543723771
3231. |a is defined by the geometry of the knife; |f can readily	be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after	cutting from the substrate; f is instrumentally determined	3447.1149081964186
3232. from	fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be	derived and the cutting force is f where |l is the shear strength	of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material w	is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness	7260.095504768884
3233. if the cutting force f is plotted against film thickness	a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope	f	2336.5201341595407
3234. however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental	methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects	occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured	value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn	6761.241906374022
3235. one of these is the fact that the knife employed no	matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge	2186.1806118071154
3236. this signifies that |a the rake angle is no longer a constant	to zero film thickness	1888.8607921460982
3237. the curvature of this bluntness is in the	case of the carboloy knife employed in the hesiometer determined by	the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals	cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0	4535.742001655124
3238. the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be	applied to this condition also	1640.4118299100446
3239. because the rake angle f at the tip	of the knife is very much smaller when compared	to the value of |a for the major portion of the knife a very rapid	increase in cutting force with thickness will result	4227.859189923139
3240. this reduces	to the relationship: f where f is the intercept at zero thickness	of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn f is the	thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife	tip f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and	the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn	8190.019606489058
3241. it can be	seen that f is a constant and is determined for the most part by the	geometry of the knife	2184.2925646452104
3242. the blunter the knife the higher is the value	of f	754.8894086429284
3243. the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material	like the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes	apparent	1727.6482158475465
3244. softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of	f inexact	960.5116589370436
3245. in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even	change during the course of a measurement	1578.1204756114187
3246. a second	factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally	determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused	by the bottom of the knife against the substrate	4667.922270471232
3247. this is not a constant	value like f but varies with the thickness of the coating and the	direction and magnitude of the resultants r and f of fig	6	3229.4516830822863
3248. under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust	f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or	lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of f	5791.3257228155335
3249. the resultant friction force f is thus directly proportional to	f and consequently also to film thickness	1418.2583964344833
3250. the value of f	can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted	on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track	under various external loadings	4644.122143988033
3251. a straight line relationship is usually	observed in a plot of f against load l having slope k	and f since the load l under actual cutting conditions	is caused by f it can be seen that f   the measured force	h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently	can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the	coating f that due to the bluntness of the knife f and that due	to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate f	or f the first two forces are directly interrelated and depend	upon film thickness whereas f is independent of these two and is a	constant for a given knifecoating combination	0.20124717349522497
3252. these theoretical	relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig 7 and their	sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made	with the hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of fig 5	for the cutting mechanism	6335.26592137206
3253. although a large number of coatings systems	particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism	frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place	2958.734588710938
3254. this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle	coatings resins or very highly pigmented films	2373.979390597572
3255. this is shown in	the photomicrograph of fig 8	260.6069777971084
3256. the basic difference between	the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism	is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously	without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the	shear plane	5911.947231997777
3257. the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been	studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the principles	found can be directly applied to coatings	2854.2986142262475
3258. by studying	high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships	as schematically illustrated in fig 9 could be observed	3698.1198750901335
3259. in the first picture the knife is just beginning to advance	into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip	formation	2340.276250713976
3260. in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to	the inclined work surface	1903.9590774962599
3261. with increasing advance of the knife into	the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear	angle rapidly decreases	2338.1585312229045
3262. eventually rupture occurs along the shear	plane and the cycle repeats itself	964.9798768085377
3263. merchant	has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry	and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be	applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values	of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional	area are used	4823.059501240268
3264. consequently if the shear angle |f	is replaced by the rupture angle f the relationships as described in	eqns will directly apply	3299.412767962242
3265. mechanism	under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a	force f against the coating and an equal opposite force f against	the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig 6	3681.142556809892
3266. if the	rake angle |a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle	|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low	enough to give a positive value for f the resultant vector r	will lie above the plane of the substrate	7450.1073158789195
3267. within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed	to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry-	and the end is still not yet in sight	3333.9320574943204
3268. urethane foam as only	one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955	1643.5868350207475
3269. yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb and expectations	are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964	2023.546269241558
3270. many of the other	foamed plastics particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential	1183.3732003565515
3271. and there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be	evaluated	786.8478362843347
3272. as this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer	has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength;	another reports that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use	in wire coating applications is being investigated	5905.836355766884
3273. on the	following pages each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described	in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing	2327.761488550667
3274. it might be well to point out however some of the newer	developments that have taken place within the past few months which	might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved	5754.378660486764
3275. in urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend	toward the polyether-type materials	and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot	molding	2336.529813504383
3276. most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating	fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that	are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets	3897.498051960919
3277. urethane	foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention	1101.8671663252553
3278. in one outstanding example whirlpool corp found that by switching	to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity	of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models	4823.872502773056
3279. much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing	the urethane foams including spraying frothing and molding		1099.4703755794699
3280. and in meeting the demands for urethane	foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating	foam to a substrate have been developed	4093.808023053997
3281. new techniques	for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost	that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including	picnic chests beverage coolers flower pots and flotation-type	swimming toys	3555.255924702587
3282. two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable	styrene's growth during the year were packaging	and foamed-core building panels	2573.7501926552723
3283. extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive	price-wise with paper- also showed much potential particularly	for packaging	1882.768111957205
3284. sandwich panels for building utility shelters that	consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused	interest in the construction field	3690.8933338526963
3285. in vinyl foam the big news	was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material		864.8345663463995
3286. better hand a more luxurious	feel and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result	1885.859857874398
3287. several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for	extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that	would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end	product to any great extent	4053.957166944239
3288. readers interested in additional	information on foams are referred to the foamed plastics chart appearing	in the technical data section and to the list of references which	appears below	4650.367314829081
3289. since the mid 1950s when	urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth	has been little short of fantastic	2160.954400172114
3290. present estimates are that production	topped the 100-million-lb mark in 1960	; by 1965 production	may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115	to 150 million lb for rigid	3993.2251516612932
3291. the markets that have started to open	up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations	2179.2190654669953
3292. furniture upholstery as just one example can easily take millions	of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation	by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment	interlining is only now getting off the ground with volume potential	in the offing	6815.714525647085
3293. urethane foams are basically	reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates		262.20477179890025
3294. blowing can be either one of two types-	carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate	or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid	such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon	5643.035906999552
3295. the most important factor	in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally	the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production	2726.4398663590314
3296. originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters	557.0542666169724
3297. these are still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid	formulations for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural	panels foamed-in-place insulation automotive safety padding arm	rests etc	2991.0667808476833
3298. more recently polyethers- again in varied compositions	molecular weights and branching- have come into use at first	for the flexible foams just lately for the rigids	4099.835189363528
3299. the polyether glycols	are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which	is much desired in cushioning	1571.1891359447977
3300. although the first polyether foams	on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method	today thanks to new catalysts they can be produced by a one-shot	technique	4836.8661551058885
3301. it is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded	on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours	and with superior properties to latex foam	3106.9100071056428
3302. the polyester urethane	foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether	group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol	one shot vs	prepolymer the isocyanate and resin are	mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs	5922.786321218986
3303. the foaming can be accomplished	at some future time at a different location by the addition of the	correct proportion of catalyst in solution	2452.4995656522688
3304. in one-shot the isocyanate	polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additives are	mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately	3061.6690014266487
3305. basically this means	that simpler processing equipment	and less external heat	are required in one-shot foaming although	at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of	one-shot foaming are critical ones	3559.452001424477
3306. most commercial	uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lbcu	ft for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lbcu ft for flexible	foams	4079.7562040491525
3307. this latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average	of 5	787.7337254846177
3308. 5 lbcu ft in commercial grades	64.77139859736022
3309. graph in fig 1 p 392 indicates how the ratio of	compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or	decreased	2325.3720246351404
3310. the single curve line represents a specific formulation in	a test example	962.6942639990463
3311. by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward	or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression	strengthdensity ratio	2173.1217996320966
3312. in flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range	between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials'	primary performance remains functionally useful	3897.651745253246
3313. in temperature	resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties	eg flexural tensile strengths etc	1261.9906346927487
3314. thermal conductivity is	directly traceable to the material's porous air-cell construction	which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which	forms its composition	4475.99238581603
3315. these air or gas bubbles make highly functional	thermal barriers	372.42721163585736
3316. the k factor a term used to denote the rate	of heat transmission through a material	ranges from 0	2602.6658951272734
3317. 28	for flexible urethane foams and from 0	168.0853246874097
3318. 16 for rigid urethane	foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature	of blowing agents used	2348.4043529923833
3319. table 1 p 394 shows a comparison of	k factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials	flexural	this term refers to the ability of a material	to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required	to cause failure by bending	4602.18826933092
3320. the higher-density urethane semi-rigid	foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance ie the	12 lbcu ft foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the	3 lbcu ft density	4647.3268429972695
3321. note that flexural strength is not always	improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always	proportional from one formulation to another	2462.380572860974
3322. where flexural strength	is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor is	aware of it	2350.5532967555196
3323. this property refers to the greatest	longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing	apart	1418.0326622524485
3324. like compression strength of urethane foams it has a direct	relationship to formulation	1178.2756689212736
3325. exceptional tensile strength is another	of urethane foam's strong features	371.5195292841855
3326. figure 2 above shows the	aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change	processing	there are many ways of producing a foamed urethane	product	4483.913079241711
3327. the foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it	can be molded it can be poured-in-place it can be applied by spray	guns etc	2980.0815799802976
3328. slab stock is still one of the most important forms	of urethane end-product in use today	1867.6570968879023
3329. basically the foam machines	that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable	mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor	belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process	and until it solidifies into foam	4620.594753844556
3330. the ingredients are fed from tanks	through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate	2133.024427819885
3331. the mixing	head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle	944.0825475207039
3332. it only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed	and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired	4304.628647052309
3333. much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate	the slab stock into finished products	1575.6730865104728
3334. profile cutting machines	are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce	sine triangle trapezoid and other profiles in variable heights	dimensions etc	4094.8440923584553
3335. the convoluted sheets can be combined to attain	certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically	1099.715549880882
3336. also	available is a slitter which peels the inside of a folded block	of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd in	length down to 116 in thick	5473.86284259477
3337. the low cost and ease of fabrication	of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide	variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to	customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case	liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices	and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports	and gas pedal covers	5568.279104684163
3338. although slab stock appeared	first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with	irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of	slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process	5478.116636166611
3339. only by resorting	to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily	in the established cushion market	1736.8170164878534
3340. the closed molding	of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction	of the material	2362.835290146081
3341. satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether	foams were never fully achieved	943.0706419048095
3342. closed molding generally resulted	in parts weighing more than parts fabricated	from free-blown foams	1412.3179143175898
3343. this counteracted the gain from having no scrap	loss	263.3742115539084
3344. in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading	of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of	gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits	5166.688972439237
3345. the introduction	of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of	new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding	2460.329162998263
3346. while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique	is fast developing	1636.9705130340076
3347. simple systems are available	that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped	etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void	2969.7798611475164
3348. in a	typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels-	an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more	than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top	of the panel is locked in place by a jig	7373.871911753519
3349. temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`f		262.42391946780714
3350. the top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs	249.48929693774485
3351. sixty	lbs loading is possible but 40 lbs is adequate	375.20057017307545
3352. the suds	box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain	pipe and the machine is started	3292.9901477343687
3353. the 160-ml bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is	applied slowly and directly to the running specimen	1569.7856711934835
3354. washing is continued	for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips	or passes through the squeeze rolls	3478.3044149101197
3355. at the conclusion of the washing	8 liters of water at 90`f are automatically metered	from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub	2976.4750199624364
3356. this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes	252.21534992588303
3357. during the rinsing	operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow	from the main drain begins	1573.136286850849
3358. at this point the drains are readjusted so	that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line	and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge	5646.075457822031
3359. when	all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the	main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs	2736.1518170465024
3360. the	run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line	1647.641836557912
3361. by this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages first	by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter	by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since	soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly	to waste from the suds box drains	4946.371672664473
3362. this method of rinsing appears	to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition	1185.4096009015466
3363. evaluation and classification	evaluation may be made on	either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired	1417.560980056323
3364. a	reflectance-measuring	instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas	soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal	2352.264502759785
3365. this test method is intended for determining	the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics made of fibers other	than wool to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering	procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home	4306.550303460326
3366. four	washing test procedures are established varying in severity from very	severe to very mild and are intended to cover the range of practical	washing from commercial procedure to hand washing	4999.583836016454
3367. five drying test	procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques	used in the home and commercial laundry	1882.3217582241036
3368. three methods for determining	the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those	textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering	3278.676138619502
3369. these tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate	dimensional changes after repeated launderings	1260.622954729335
3370. table 1	summarizes all of the various washing drying and restoration procedures	available	1181.132538147132
3371. the person using these tests must determine which combination	of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to	evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after	laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry	4214.646491088464
3372. it is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code	consisting of a roman numeral a letter and an arabic number	3498.6965896977754
3373. for	example test 3 e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed	by procedure 3	in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure e	and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension	presser by procedure 1	4551.5711888680125

3396. a perforated aluminum plate used to provide	the drying surface is heated by means of a flatiron	2128.5019721751855
3397. a special template	is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for	a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps	knit shrinkage gauge- consisting of a set of 20 mounting	each pin is individually	sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in	the slot	5038.642424733304
3398. the springs have an extension of 1 inch at f tension	753.9007024797303
3399. the	tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative	force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane	of the test specimen	2854.631669262712
3400. the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the	collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely	extended state is 14 inches	4092.735836943967
3401. the surface of the apparatus	in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as	to be as friction-free as possible	2338.9803402627663
3402. the preparation	of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional	restorability procedure to be used	2357.8463037146494
3403. three specimens	for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory	average of performance	1871.0321676728386
3404. this is especially true for knitted	fabrics	140.40705136257674
3405. specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with	a standard atmosphere of f and f and then laid out without tension	on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is	free from wrinkles or creases	4049.1746233695267
3406. fabrics that are badly distorted in their	unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional	change results when laundered by any procedure	3691.4651314921052
3407. this also holds	true	if restorative forces are applied	262.9494025777704
3408. therefore it is recommended that	in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional	change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative	only	4666.610754334574
3409. generally it is necessary to mark distances on	a specimen in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and	to measure before and after laundering	2322.530361810668
3410. the distances may be marked	with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into	the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine	4131.01936004295
3411. the marked distances	are parallel to the respective yarns	262.85085275523244
3412. usually the greater the	original distances marked the greater will be the accuracy of the	woven	fabrics to be dried by procedure b or restored by	the specimen of fabric is a rectangle	at least 22 by 22 inches except for cloth narrower than 22 inches	in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric	8126.073126460224
3413. three	distances each at least 18 inches are measured and marked off parallel	to each of the warp and filling directions	2032.9571350573483
3414. the distances are at	woven or warp knitted	each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches	2358.832875588708
3415. place the template	on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square	cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven	fabrics or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics and so that the	same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all	sides	5323.668189174834
3416. mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen	and indelible ink; also place three dots on the specimen at each	side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately	circular knitted	fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2	each specimen is approximately 16 inches square	7882.2448748258885

3418. critical measurements in length and width	directions should be taken before and after washing drying and restorative	procedures	2365.0279953210893
3419. the washing	procedures are summarized in table 2	165.90031724924967
3420. place the specimen	in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry	load of f pounds	2812.737894784847

3422. immediately	add water at 100-105`f to the wheel to a level	of f inches; this level will be increased by condensed steam	3244.7960876555817
3423. when this water level has been reached inject steam into the wheel until	the temperature reaches that shown in column b of table 2	2450.1116494845023
3424. add sufficient soap	to furnish a good running suds or if desired use a synthetic detergent	1888.7946231975761
3425. stop the wash wheel at the end of the	time	shown in column a of table 2 and drain	1720.9598132995138
3426. refill the machine	to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f	and start the machine	2351.971703130096
3427. inject steam if necessary to reach the	temperature shown in column d of table 2	1093.23350216845

3431. refill the machine to a	level of f inches with water at 100-109` f	933.0338202312562
3432. when this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature	is that shown in column d	2344.1573522130225

3434. immediately refill to a level	of f inches with water at 100-109` f	1172.2978066390533
3435. when	this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is	that shown in column f	1561.45670853561
3436. drain off the water at such a time that	the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the	sum of the times shown in columns a c and e measured from	the time the wash wheel was started	6554.178444687753
3437. high-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under	conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time	required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of	practicability	3105.9775567914235
3438. examples of such situations are night reconnaissance	the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues	special radiography in medical or industrial applications track recording	of high energy particles etc	4852.284822932639
3439. high-gain photoelectronic	image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of	cascading single stages by coupling	lens systems	image intensifier based upon the multipactor	transmission secondary electron multiplication	cascading of single	stages enclosed in one common envelope	4015.4181935064867
3440. cascading single stages	by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems	limit the obtainable gain quite severely	2815.676285497821
3441. channel-type image intensifiers	are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer however	from an inherently low resolution	1260.5481379112973
3442. image intensifiers based upon	the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable	resolution is concerned	2373.6850089779537
3443. however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts	the effective gain	262.0083248568577
3444. tsem tubes have been constructed showing	high gain and resolution	561.948702000668
3445. however electrostatic focus important	for many applications has not been realized for these devices	946.0123415071488
3446. resolution	limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to	chromatic aberrations	955.650540807459
3447. furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to	have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be	tolerated	1734.874658416132
3448. cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope	have been constructed with high gain and high resolution	2122.2383250665257
3449. these	tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system	and in the design of the coupling members	2034.7693768799422
3450. the electron optical system	may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one	962.481480676964
3451. the magnification	may be smaller equal or larger than unity	373.2242759755395
3452. an electrostatic	system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing	in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen	is utilized while a magnetic system requires accurate	adjustment of the solenoid which is heavy and bulky	6197.272546531287
3453. as it will be discussed	later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing	curved fiber couplers	1411.5414408969593
3454. it should be noted however that the paraxial	resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems	2112.273106415394
3455. it is felt that fiber-coupled double- stage image intensifiers	will gain considerable importance in the future	1250.6844719111218
3456. therefore we	shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities	of such tubes	1893.4778640897869
3457. the luminous efficiency and resolution of single	stages fiber couplers and finally of the composite tube will be	computed	1729.6541965139136
3458. it will be shown theoretically that the high image	intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits	the utilization of extremely low incident light levels	4301.838879253586
3459. the effect	of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels	will be described	1268.398813322274
3460. after these theoretical considerations constructional	details of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image	intensifier will be discussed	1871.7949138711126
3461. measured performance characteristics	for this experimental tube will be listed	371.27003584927644
3462. the conclusion shall	be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible	and practical approach to high-gain image intensification	2577.692228225519
3463. design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier	the tube	design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall	be described now	2177.5100669109725
3464. the electron optical system is	based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode	and anode surfaces	2582.886899487288
3465. the inner anode sphere is pierced elongated	into a cup and terminated by the phosphor screen	1267.6688654717982
3466. the photoelectrons	emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused	by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres pass through	the negative lens formed by the anode aperture and impinge	upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen	6356.663006582339
3467. the cylindrical focusing	electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the	focusing potential	1259.587682824836
3468. the anode potential codetermines the gain g	and magnification m of the stage	1197.4780651874119
3469. both the photocathode	and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved	concave as seen from the anode aperture	2044.1252520046048
3470. the field-flattening property	of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the	peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or	coupling member	3909.0918076432076
3471. for the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave	its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent	record is desired	2321.2550186265125
3472. as it will be shown later the field-flattening	properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed	the main advantage of such a design	3911.492568017359
3473. the second photocathode	and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates	945.6510774469203
3474. the photocathode sensitivities s phosphor efficiencies	p and anode potentials v of the individual stages shall	be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 and 2 in the text	where required	4829.371001820692
3475. both stages are assumed to have unity magnification	166.94555831577276
3476. _flux gain of a single	stage	to a first approximation given by the product of the photocathode	sensitivity s	and the phosphor conversion efficiency p	3913.455758752196
3477. in	general p is a function of v and the current density	but it shall here be assumed as a constant	2035.0336486006017
3478. the luminous	efficiency f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant	sensitivity f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light	f by the relation: f where f h normalized radiant photocathode	sensitivity	5626.491760499019
3479. f h standard visibility function	14.795276018581035
3480. the luminous flux	gain of a single stage is given by: f if the input light distribution	falls beyond the visible range f as expected since f	4307.134042985714
3481. such	cases are not considered here	43.336601525002436
3482. the numerical aperture of the fibers	is given by: f where f	963.7682828680063
3483. the angle f is measured in	the medium of index f	501.40228870772324
3484. settled phosphors as generally used in image	intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface	hence f shall be assumed	3051.1063902089168
3485. the numerical aperture should be in general	close to unity	373.9796554964343
3486. this condition can be satisfied eg with f	and f or equivalent glass combinations	1412.2094646955118
3487. a sufficiently good	approximation for determining the end reflection losses r	can be	obtained from the angle independent fresnel formula: f for phosphor	to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming f we obtain	f percent	3948.5161172389867
3488. this value may be reduced to 4	140.44808054472676
3489. 6 percent by means of a	glass layer of index 1	499.4517865544277
3490. hence the f factor for the output	fiber coupler is f	755.5674014408622
3491. as the index of refraction of photosensitive	surfaces of the sbcs-type lies around 2 the fresnel losses	at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0	2468.0566860379477
3492. 5 percent and the	f factor for the interstage coupler is 0	965.8003731837116
3493. it might be anticipated	that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further	945.9032943621733
3494. the internal losses are due to absorption and the small but	finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to	deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute	imperfections of the core-jacket interface	5620.661944694152
3495. these losses depend	on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of	the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular	distribution of the incident light	3448.0786049072462
3496. explicit expressions	are given in the literature	140.91252634233214
3497. lacking reliable data for some	of the variables we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent	internal losses for 14-inch long small diameter	fibers	2727.010928541778
3498. this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber	diameters increasing the number of internal reflections	2356.4649340124197
3499. since we are	considering here relatively small diameter fiber plates	their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their internal	losses may be assumed as 15 percent	3110.1602444780906
3500. the packing	efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much attention	in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally	used until rather recently	4646.510569704859
3501. for circular fibers in a closely	packed hexagonal array the packing efficiency is given by: f where	f and 0	1889.8961485554028
3502. 906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the	circumscribed hexagon	1882.831511547104
3503. for the small diameter fibers now technically	feasible and required for about 100 f resolution f	1254.447384721733
3504. the cladding	thickness is about 0	65.8838304766711
3505. 5|m hence f and f	14.812599642126504
3506. thus	the efficiency |t couplers is given by- f or approximately	50 percent each	1413.17506630515
3507. it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace	a glass window and a membrane in addition to an optical	output lens system	2335.5598934308723
3508. the efficiency f of an f lens at the magnification	f is: f neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling	membrane and the output window f would be 6 percent and 8 percent	5499.290847603026
3509. thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two	fiber plates is 0	1102.629352468526
3510. 043 or about	gain of fiber	including the brightness gain f due	to the f area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double	stage image intensifier is: f it is obvious that the careful	choice of photocathode which maximizes f for a given input e	is very important	7401.104769926646
3511. the same consideration should govern the choice	of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral	sensitivity of the ultimate sensor	2177.077952531722
3512. we have evaluated the matching integrals for two types	of photocathodes and three types of light input	2122.081993660825
3513. the input light distributions considered are p-11 and p-20	phosphor emission and the so-called night light	as given by hw babcock and j j johnson	2614.9911925022507
3514. the integrals	are listed in table 14-1 below:	discussion of paraxial device resolution	_resolution limitations	the resolution limitations for a single stage are	given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as	well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing	screen	6816.416819568409
3515. the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system	depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations	1413.9200078741685
3516. it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields	a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity	magnification	3699.803333428588
3517. furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend	on the chosen high voltage	377.21436705233083
3518. in general a high anode voltage reduces	chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution	1651.4161234208646
3519. the luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from eq	for the 16 possible combinations of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes	and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screens for night light	and p-20 light input	3664.857341712788
3520. it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional x-ray		283.3073310622898
3521. the following efficiencies obtained from jedec	and rca specifications were used: f   the following	table gain values computed according	to eq with f:   the possibility of a space charge	blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has	been pointed out	4451.0027319909905
3522. it is obvious that such an influence can only be	expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output	levels	3694.5380458204695
3523. space charge influences will also decrease at increased	voltages	262.8227395878899
3524. electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have	been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography	1653.7489570065638
3525. a resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible	502.57326399851
3526. the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor	screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness	decreases with decreasing porosity	and might be impaired by the	normally used aluminum mirror	4306.548133433664
3527. thus in general elementary light	optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable	resolution limit	1419.9023837926284
3528. it should be noted that photoluminescence	due to bremsstrahlung generated within the viewing screen by electron	impact appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess	of 30 kv are utilized	5160.233548338258
3529. it has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent	phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 f	at high voltage values of approximately 20 kv	2591.7407686002034
3530. for the further discussion	we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 f	and phosphor screen resolution of 60 f	3275.780828543552
3531. the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply	the policy	1101.7564466882432
3532. an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the	best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product	4117.4593066857005
3533. there are thus three components to an optimal design problem:	the specification of the operating variables and the transformation	the specification of the objective function	of which the optimization is desired	3355.1897074176704
3534. for a chemical process	the	first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical	species and the temperature or pressure of the stream	3913.540696101408
3535. for the	second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling	to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends	on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed	in the next chapter	4543.553557647632
3536. the objective function is some measure of	the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject	of chapter 4	3486.0039382746
3537. the essential characteristic of an optimal policy	when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages	with no feedback was first isolated by bellman	2986.3281244839586
3538. he recognized that	whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r-stage	process the remaining stages must use an optimal f-stage policy	with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there	is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process	7136.523361151181
3539. moreover by	systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and	always using the optimal f-stage policy for the remaining stages	we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages	3565.432076815123
3540. proceeding	in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we	may gradually build up the policy for any number	3677.0350888625
3541. at each step of the	calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied	1264.8786961098883
3542. to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there	are m operating variables at each stage and that the state	is specified by n variables; then the search for the maximum	at any one stage will require a number of operations of order f		5771.124544794349
3543. to proceed from	one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated	to allow of interpolation; this number will be of the order	of f	3200.1667125971544
3544. if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy	for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at	the final step	4127.006639661246
3545. thus a number of operations of the order of f are	required	635.4935416047136
3546. if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously	f operations would be required to do the same job and as r	increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations	required by the dynamic program	6052.781664366366
3547. but even more important than	this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all	operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that	for the given feed state and r stages	3762.013797453267
3548. in contrast the dynamic	program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for	any smaller number of stages	2800.9787947981017
3549. if the problem is enlarged to require	a complete coverage of feed states f operations are needed by the dynamic	program and f by the direct search	2869.3926069881973
3550. but f is vastly larger	than r	140.600915328309
3551. no optimism is more baseless than that which believes	that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the	crudest of methods in searching out a result	3211.676226947802
3552. suppose that f and	that the average operation requires only f sec	963.7092723341966
3553. then the dynamic	program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would	take	more than three millennia!   the principle of optimality thus	brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of	a multistage decision process	4231.929179188154
3554. bellman has annunciated in the	following terms:   an optimal policy has the property that	whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions	must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting	from the first decision	6358.853532432278
3555. this is the principle which	we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation	1405.7078627285273
3556. it appears	in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital	computer	1882.4184276318363
3557. at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce	the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of	the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for	ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end	4883.893985381574
3558. the discrete deterministic process	consider the process illustrated	in fig 2	755.1447030712418
3559. 1 consisting of r distinct stages	43.509713280282305
3560. these	will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process	stream so that stage r is the rth stage from the end	4097.462293987219
3561. let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector	f and the operating variables of stage r by f	2466.858697110805
3562. thus	f denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and	f the state of the product from the last stage	3509.1012348661766
3563. each stage transforms	the state f of its feed to the state f in a way that depends on	the operating variables f	2327.676570432408
3564. this transformation	is uniquely determined by f and we therefore speak of the process	as deterministic	1876.8683921741242
3565. in practical situations there will be restrictions	on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging	to a fixed and bounded set s	2747.4729002414724
3566. the set of vectors f	constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a	policy is admissible if all the f belong to s	4105.7876395618205
3567. when the policy	has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the	state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation;	thus f	3006.7735159304543
3568. the objective function which is to be maximized is some	function usually piecewise continuous of the product state	2358.4831228696075
3569. let this	be denoted by f	43.22620241596131
3570. an optimal policy is an admissible policy	f which maximizes the objective function p	1411.8692387943638
3571. the policy may	not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly is and once	the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by	as a function of the feed state f	3656.9117436517977
3572. let f where the maximization	is over all admissible policies f	752.6710733519213
3573. when it is necessary to be specific	we say that the optimal policy is an optimal r-stage policy	with respect to the feed state f	2601.6469223460886
3574. for any choice of admissible	policy f in the first stage the state of the stream leaving	this stage is given by f	3478.089308711062
3575. this is the feed state of the subsequent	f stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to this state	2981.6782212450303
3576. this will result	in a value f of the objective function and when f is chosen correctly	this will give f the maximum of the objective function	4286.122167350608
3577. thus	f	where the maximization is over all admissible policies f and f	is related to f by can be solved	for f when f is known and clearly f the maximization being	over all admissible f	3947.0060329489816
3578. the set of equations and the	starting equation is of a recursive type well suited to programming	on the digital computer	3045.2195372642786
3579. in finding the optimal r-stage policy	from that of f stages only the function f is needed	1416.0562726471762
3580. when	f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of	f and the whole calculation repeated	2823.307470142472
3581. we also see how the results	may be presented although if n the number of state variables	is large any tabulation will become cumbersome	2450.224035591179
3582. a table or set of tables	may be set out as in table 2	1396.2129203410602
3583. to extract the optimal	r-stage policy with respect to the feed state f we enter section	r of this table at the state f and find immediately	from the last column the maximum value of the objective function	4036.1625243175645
3584. in	the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and	in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used	4304.2396341749445
3585. since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to f we may enter section f	of the table at this state f and read off the optimal policy for stage	f and the resulting state f	4520.41617467241
3586. proceeding in this way up the table	we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we	can check on f by evaluating f at the last stage	4822.083331947906
3587. it may be	that the objective function depends not only on f but also on f	as when the cost of the operating policy is considered	2736.1750880651725
3588. a moment's	reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally	well in this case	1871.462702462733
3589. a form of objective function that we shall often	have occasion to consider is f	1099.1918112181916
3590. here v represents	the	the cost	of operating the stage with conditions 	519.2508925479597
3591. hence p	is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that	is the net profit	1885.2176398400309
3592. if f denotes the net profit from stage r	and f then the principle of optimality gives f this sequence	of equations may be started with the remark that with no process f there	is no profit ie f	6182.028726947398
3593. the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only	statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design	it is not as important as the deterministic process	3456.20262622268
3594. in this case	the stage r operating with conditions f transforms the state	of the stream from f to f but only the probability distribution of	f is known	4663.524760174346
3595. this is specified by a distribution function f such	that the probability that f lies in some region d of the stage	space is f	2588.6768211458843
3596. we cannot now speak of maximizing the value	of the objective function since this function is now known only in a	probabilistic sense	3492.0484175563083
3597. we can however maximize its expected value	93.66339278563835
3598. for	a single stage we may define f where the maximization is by choice	of f	1883.0857085278926
3599. we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected	value of the objective function for a given f	1735.0403689280297
3600. if we consider a process	in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the	next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent	stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first	6579.6031241180335
3601. then f the maximization being over all admissible f and the integration	over the whole of stage space	1579.1812691737891
3602. the type of presentation	of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except	that now the fourth column is redundant	3474.4862666792096
3603. the third column gives	the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r	and enter the preceding section of the table at this state	3102.575279644764
3604. the	discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not	known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter	4295.7742500036675
3605. in many cases it is not	possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages	since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner	through the process	3553.8662472670467
3606. we replace r the number of the stage	from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which	measures the distance of the point considered from the end of the	process	5327.964058362418
3607. the word distance is used here in a rather general sense;	it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the	process	2853.753642497323
3608. if t is the total length of the process its	feed state may be denoted by a vector  and the product	state by  denotes the state at	any point t and  the vector of operating variables	there	5921.62702649653
3609. a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is	well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the	gyro-platform-servo combination	2029.9016328752525
3610. the restrained gyro-stabilized platform	with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate	equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows:	f where u is a torque applied about the output axis of the	controlling gyro	5641.216661526452
3611. the platform angle |f is the angle about	which the gyro is controlling	792.4536324644312
3612. this is normally termed the gyro input	axis 90` away from the gyro output or |j axis	2142.782481378239
3613. the gyro angular	momentum is defined by h	167.61121651183154
3614. thus if the gyro and platform-controller	combination maintains the platform with zero angular	deviation about the |f axis the system can be rotated with an	angular velocity f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis |j	6212.713045443233
3615. it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers	so that a torque can be applied about their output axes	2179.095270556616
3616. in the system shown in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is amplified	and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer	3499.3607106955133
3617. this torque causes the entire system to rotate about the |f	axis since the response to f	1409.7398333176366
3618. if the polarities are correct the	platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output	to zero	2827.333661131329
3619. as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied	to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases	1895.706875819676
3620. finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system	remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled	2595.261878538349
3621. a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in	fig 7-2	786.1652452275091
3622. the platform is initially off level by the angle |f	563.8501380186337
3623. the angle generated by the platform servo |f multiplied by g	is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer	1739.3738843671485
3624. f	is the scale factor of the accelerometer	250.761010605751
3625. the voltage f is amplified	by f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor f	1412.6134753120932
3626. finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented	by f the system as indicated in fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple	because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the	accelerometer have been neglected	5640.74673844391
3627. with these factors included an upper	limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations	1413.326932767523
3628. in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it	provides a fast response time	2349.595350812478
3629. when the frequency response characteristics	of practical components are considered their effect on	stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop	gain	2717.763985689359
3630. the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately	inversely proportional to the servo loop gain	2816.045477436194
3631. in addition	the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional	to the servo loop gain; ie high loop gain causes the	system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations	3219.0643863725627
3632. this problem	usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response	time	1402.4622581978385
3633. it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer	responds to any input acceleration	1100.986612792105
3634. the equation relating input	acceleration to output platform angle is f in practice the preflight	leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe	4113.6081239744735
3635. when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform	angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on	the accelerometers	2176.4758940125203
3636. there are many such components of acceleration present	due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around	the vehicle etc	3257.0201803102486
3637. one of the greatest problems associated with automatic	leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level	acceleration noise	2040.642776798421
3638. one solution to the problem is to operate	with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters	2371.6314608479406
3639. this technique	causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components	such as the platform tilt	1572.6145233538778
3640. since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering	increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached	2356.6899169979824
3641. one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the	use of a non-linear amplifier for f	1417.6523672500182
3642. the amplifier is designed so	that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold	level	2352.8867582538583
3643. below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional	and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering	2038.918819694313
3644. the	effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at	a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is	controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response	so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process	7105.643303111932
3645. when	the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by	the output of the leveling system	1731.1059959611928
3646. the platform actually	tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified	by f will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel	the gyro drift	4663.197475040549
3647. the amount of platform dip required depends upon the	scale factors of the system	942.0665996492673
3648. the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily	adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating	gyros	2804.010410098974
3649. the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits	260.17573718372523
3650. however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled	remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform	2605.4824375403305
3651. this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically	as long as the system is actuated	1265.9930965549822
3652. a useful by-product of this	system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases	is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level	4650.020694776354
3653. the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results	are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment	1738.7869321239618
3654. the	process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs	of both accelerometers are zero	1879.8594050013485
3655. the turning is accomplished by applying	voltage to the gyro torquers described above	788.4157286736333
3656. in brief the human	replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7-2	959.3730186360342
3657. manual leveling	requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs	374.5546346674796
3658. if	high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary	to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs		1812.1216611076875
3659. with integration the effect of a small	acceleration can be seen after a time	945.7892343706748
3660. however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a	platform to any degree of accuracy	2584.3606790864983
3661. also it requires more time as	compared to the automatic approach	503.83476627019354
3662. manual leveling is inconvenient	if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged	period of time	2352.884045338224
3663. the operator must continually supply the correct	amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of	gyro drift is canceled	2458.489498007708
3664. this process is especially difficult since gyro	drifting is typically random	750.2435951500535
3665. platform	heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers	parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator	1876.4919569178924
3666. in simpler	terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction	1178.275880944478
3667. for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available	to accomplish the platform heading:  use of external or	surveying equipment to establish proper heading	2311.348524374447
3668. use of the	characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true	heading the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy	requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish	the heading	5790.774388654503
3669. with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be	headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques	1412.2978955341696
3670. the platform	accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure	558.0708051888674
3671. before	the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of	their sensitive axis must be accurately determined	1578.765036667686
3672. a mirror is mounted	on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular	to the sensitive axis of the unit	3502.0325073897175
3673. a precision transit	is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north	1248.956427063708
3674. this	can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques	1423.9176690179886
3675. with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers	is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned	2333.2829871800272
3676. the	sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to	project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer	mirror	4473.114257509356
3677. when the platform is aligned the reflected image	of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original	crossed hairs	2168.2967386046557
3678. the images can easily be aligned with a high degree	of accuracy	963.3303027513837
3679. the platform is turned as required by supplying currents	to the appropriate gyro torquers	939.1076187461495
3680. although this technique is	simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist: the direction	of true north must be known for each launch point	3675.853308854365
3681. however	this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying	team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work	2859.555238706025
3682. in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground	a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight	3496.7190495017726
3683. with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with	surveying equipment	1094.0793945102555
3684. if the platform is not too high off the ground	a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform	3907.783772500197
3685. obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since	errors are introduced because of motion of the stand	1729.4276331931844
3686. the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator	249.6669025075772
3687. this instrument	provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations	of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform	on true heading	2736.8323507169994
3688. the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified	and supplied to the z-gyro torquer	1423.3043846538285
3689. if the polarity is	correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero	1262.0790973116675
3690. information is also available from this autocollimator system to set	the drift bias for the z-axis gyro	2117.6697559860972
3691. if the z gyro	is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to	the gyro torquer to cancel the drift	2183.251719856088
3692. if the drift error is systematic	it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted	to supply the required compensating current	4090.493528339667
3693. it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which	will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction	and the platform	2324.167826295543
3694. essentially the stator or reference portion of	the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction	and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the	angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero	5950.238382759566
3695. gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system	which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true	heading	1721.7417427047542
3696. for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of	three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive	axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction	at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive	axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point	7622.074110970044
3697. the	accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform	168.07680146691456
3698. thus if one accelerometer	is properly aligned the other is also	757.5033796602581
3699. the input axis of the	appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers	1258.346410050583
3700. figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro	vectors arranged as described above	1416.0479934020445
3701. the platform is leveled and properly	headed so that the x-gyro input axis is parallel to the	east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis is parallel to	the north-south direction	3232.642072525558
3702. the input axis of the x gyro	when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to	the spin axis of earth	3270.763189781353
3703. if the platform is not properly headed the	x-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation	1738.00565810944
3704. the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized	to direct the platform into proper heading	2593.9290709094143
3705. in fig 7-4	the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the	earth	1581.0575861001143
3706. the point is at a latitude |l and the platform is at	an error in heading east	2134.378705273134
3707. the earth is spinning at an angular velocity	\q equal to one revolution per 24 hr	1263.788788157243
3708. when the platform is	level |e is a rotation about the z axis of the platform	f	2127.6540589722053
3709. since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform	is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on	the earth will see the platform rotating	3132.6128576370043
3710. scotty did not go back to school	141.15004314326472
3711. his parents	talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist	at the university hospital- mr mckinley was entitled to a	discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be	best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time	in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose- provided of	course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating	0.20124717349522497
3712. his	teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed	that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was	little danger of his losing a term	5479.94320387579
3713. scotty accepted the decision	with indifference and did not enter the arguments	636.6270438066405
3714. he was	discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his	parents had what mr mckinley described as a celebration lunch	at the cafeteria on the campus	4883.5652913641325
3715. rachel wore a smart hat and because	she had been warned recently about smoking puffed at her cigarettes	through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick	2750.2209052603457
3716. scotty's father	sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a cricket looking about	at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression	of proprietorship	4289.501646233653
3717. teachers- men who wore brown suits and	had gray hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk shop	and to be introduced to scotty and rachel	2987.0295505830677
3718. rachel was polite scotty	indifferent	22.156357233284396
3719. they ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces	and scotty gazed without interest at his food the teachers the heroic	baronial windows and the bright ranks of college banners	3233.757431872489
3720. his father	tried to make the food a topic	390.9150937942729
3721. the blueberry pie is good	scotty	43.37594111719706
3722. he looked at his son his face worried	249.39625100121435
3723. scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to	bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him	2595.2997886076914
3724. scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment	of interest	1649.0222560995182
3725. he said more loudly i'm full old pop	167.24712295774077
3726. he	had eaten almost nothing on the crested three-sectioned plate and	had drunk about half the milk in its paper container	3071.7913431562947
3727. he's	all right craig rachel said	43.45031429104257
3728. i can fix him something later	in the afternoon when we get home	1173.672529237493
3729. since his seizure scotty	had had little appetite; yet his changed appearance surprisingly	was one of plumpness	1409.7286148574478
3730. his face was fuller; his lips and the usually	sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking	2109.019187009317
3731. he breathed now	with his mouth open showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth;	he kept his eyes with their puffed blurred lids always lowered	though not apparently focusing	3232.0139247174952
3732. even his neck seemed thicker and	therefore shorter	251.21685842010947
3733. his hands which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering	birds were now neither active nor really relaxed	1891.2787418921064
3734. they lay	on his lap palms up stiffly motionless the tapered fingers a little	thick at the joints	2349.080225550416
3735. altogether he had since the seizure the appearance	of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise	1729.220133421608
3736. he looked	lazy spoiled a little querulous	141.19341501700592
3737. rachel had little to say	14.783956782517075
3738. she greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness offering	nothing	558.4552809447288
3739. mr mckinley for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity	was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still	face jumping to anticipate scotty's desires	2864.9082354145617
3740. it was a strained silent	lunch	65.25364293051997
3741. rachel said i'd better get him to bed	166.03130400913975
3742. the doctors had suggested scotty remain most of every afternoon	in bed until he was stronger	1861.31792991465
3743. since mr mckinley had to	give a lecture rachel and scotty drove home alone in the plymouth	1424.4850955934112
3744. they did not speak much	22.053336983848887
3745. scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and	said softly look at those stupid kids	1096.482424684312
3746. it was a negro section	of peeling row houses store-front churches and ragged children	1410.795534363493
3747. rachel	had to bend toward scotty and ask him to repeat	502.5948125915008
3748. and then: there are lots of kids around here	391.0469561232073
3749. scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes	dull	643.2367532995977
3750. he felt tired and full and calm	140.8296989026276
3751. the	days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost	the same	939.2389646495242
3752. he rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to	have breakfast either alone or with rachel	2597.359564153599
3753. virginia treated him with	attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits	cookies candies- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen	2730.4446740344124
3754. she would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously	watch the progress of scotty's fork or spoon	2586.9483818148915
3755. you don't	eat enough honey	14.770521660809374
3756. try to get that down	22.20510066442136
3757. rachel observing	would say he has to rediscover his own capacity	504.9978884469736
3758. virginia and rachel talked to each other quietly	now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war	atmosphere	3252.2650844276523
3759. both watched scotty constantly rachel without seeming	to virginia openly her eyes filled with concern	1098.8957748384503
3760. he did not resent their supervision or virginia's sometimes tiring	sympathy	755.4174141885835
3761. he ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as	he pleased and moved about the draughty rooms of the house when he	was not in bed with slow dubious steps like an elderly tourist in a	cathedral	4304.695137215638
3762. he was able now to sit for hours	in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without	moving	3689.3642793219187
3763. his hands lay loosely yet stiffly- they were like wax hands:	almost lifelike not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung	slightly open	2448.3296716151353
3764. when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way	that some response was inescapable he would answer; if as often	happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would	repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only	a little louder	7543.034168209435
3765. he had not mentioned kate	14.765686333522703
3766. he had not even	thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his	slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost accidentally encounter	her	4284.317844376678
3767. at these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but	it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity	and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back	of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part	of his weakness	5228.28781191063
3768. he was calm drugged and lazy	65.24261555662703
3769. rachel mentioned kate	0.20041515
3770. she said i notice the girl from	across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit	1900.7714135690117
3771. scotty	said that's all right	14.799367857029358
3772. he thought	about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else	1182.2906261137882
3773. once sitting at the front window in his parents' room he	saw kate come out of her house	1569.5423541086836
3774. they were	far off and looked tiny	141.2229255946881
3775. the heavy branches in his front yard would hide	and then reveal them	783.1011979586766
3776. they turned at the bottom of kate's steps	and moved off in the direction of the park	2127.1078901940155
3777. he thought he saw- it	awakened and for a moment interested him- that elizabeth held a	leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash	3550.6871518441685
3778. then they disappeared and scotty got up and went into his own	room and got into bed	2139.3188528626033
3779. by the time he was under the covers he had forgotten	about seeing kate	944.7880878069979
3780. the doctor since scotty was no longer	allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often	and informally to the house	3879.3321764416323
3781. he would sit slim-waisted and spare	on the edge of scotty's bed his legs crossed so elaborately that the	crossed foot could tap the floor	2588.363436358687
3782. scotty did not mind the doctor's	unsmiling teasing as he used to	970.9508190479085
3783. husky young man he	said with mock distaste	167.62486863286497
3784. i imagine you're always battling in school	139.78692265775095
3785. i don't go to school any more	93.21236101666832
3786. pardon	0.30041514999999996
3787. the doctor had to bend close to hear; his delicate hand as	veined as a moth's wing rested absently on scotty's chest	2184.166454119949
3788. scotty	said the same words more loudly	142.30743412437306
3789. well we're taking a	little vacation that's all	167.5671939573162
3790. he turned unsmilingly to rachel	22.297158471322653
3791. i	think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little	1409.3834920399545
3792. he could now but the weakness is very definite; it would exhaust	him further and unnecessarily	1899.7965859363162
3793. his stethoscope	was on the table by scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged	it at scotty	1724.1520199480517
3794. he said fussily just keep the cap on those	strong emotions	752.724755731381

3802. she said do you think you'll miss school	249.39988371280637
3803. he	had noticed how formal and irritably exact rachel had grown	506.08187970870785
3804. he felt her irritability did not concern him yet he knew	he would not care even if it did	2585.217613256409
3805. we've	had any number of calls about you	166.2422353625623
3806. you could win a popularity contest	at that school without any trouble	953.0863637939077
3807. she wants to pay you a visit	94.47219272697038
3808. she says the children miss you	65.37618065492117
3809. apparently	you were the light of their lives	167.96945776371203
3810. rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him	then moved away	1893.1018794876386
3811. that doctor annoys me	2.9297641017805476
3812. she	seemed to speak to herself	64.54994716290493
3813. do you suppose his self-consciousness	is characteristic of the new negro professionals or merely of doctors	in general	1576.425305412776
3814. she turned to him again	22.273256684797115
3815. well mrs	charles- sally- has phoned too	94.39862929023067
3816. rachel's	tone was dry	4.467505630650363
3817. she didn't really say- she glanced	away at the floor then swooped gracefully and picked up one of scotty's	slippers	1887.3727159576822
3818. i mean do you feel like seeing kate	251.3463881550364
3819. scotty said i don't know	14.850412415145874
3820. he did not	0.30041514999999996
3821. there	was the slight pain but it was no different from the throbbing in	his head	1256.7351313686304
3822. well there's time in any case	64.27355496300495
3823. we'll wait	till you're stronger and then talk about it	373.2508359577461
3824. she put the slipper	neatly	by its mate at the foot of the bed	1410.2804871169458
3825. this time rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead	261.66372635283784
3826. his father was a constant visitor	65.55854719247004
3827. scotty	would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep	slow voice; it floated up the stairs	2035.4959230102772
3828. how's scotty	0.30041514999999996
3829. and rachel's or virginia's reply: better	43.84044157789094
3830. he's	getting plenty of rest	22.066244588116213
3831. is his appetite improved	2.9443236512562785
3832. or: does he get exercise	22.207653280107234
3833. the exchange was almost	invariable and scotty in his bed could hear every word of it	1254.079685898253
3834. it required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical	about his father	1411.802682619969
3835. his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously	at the foot of the bed and look at his son	1732.227390593056
3836. after a pause	during which he studied scotty's face as if scotty were not there	and could not study him too mr mckinley would ask the same	questions he had asked downstairs	5184.646853829056
3837. scotty would reply softly and	his father apologetically would ask him to repeat	788.1550145360793
3838. i'm	eating more he would say	65.62695240442392
3839. or: i walk around the house a	lot	167.98852657073095
3840. perhaps you should get out a little	139.71414888169892
3841. i'm	not supposed to yet	14.703541373557542
3842. he did not mind	the useless kindly questions	252.3271489881325
3843. he looked at the lined face with vague	interest; he felt he was noting it as if it were something he might	think about when he grew stronger	2978.817607853945
3844. mr mckinley examined	everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for	his son's illness	1893.183046910933
3845. have you got enough blankets	14.731912275617052
3846. and	another time without accusation: you never wore that scarf	i bought you	1190.6050720703286
3847. where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves	upward in angry motion papa-san sat glacier-like his smooth solidity	his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him	3225.2597860386477
3848. our	objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is papa-san	1181.5663004429787
3849. there the objective sat brooding over all	93.67207273033196
3850. gouge burn	blast insult it as they would could anyone really take papa-san	1181.7167576114775
3851. between the ponderous hulk and himself in the valley over which	papa-san reigned men had hidden high explosives booby traps and	mines	2184.325718172715
3852. the raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion	389.22746114546464
3853. on	the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed	wire	1251.2391468468677
3854. at the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye	range like a wild tangle of children's hoops stopped simultaneously	weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to	start them all rolling again	6045.96388676877
3855. closer still regular barricades of barbed	wire hung on timber supports	496.47410465265705
3856. was it all vain labor	22.16834463313299
3857. who would	clean up the mess when the war was over	503.77686418592555
3858. smiling at his quixotic	thoughts warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before	sitting down	2381.89060308205
3859. tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself	would go out there somewhere and wait	1255.8078512705183
3860. if he were to go with white	he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some	point between here and papa-san but moving ever deeper into enemy	land- behind papa-san itself	5921.710800871891
3861. was this what he had expected	43.823388126061374
3862. he	hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think so many	lulls	1640.405313511458
3863. somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat	was an intermittent activity	1246.878764741911
3864. now he knew that the moment illuminated	by the vision on the train would have to be approached	2351.5316723792243
3865. it could	take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now	790.5674283006877
3866. there	was just too much time	64.861826686024
3867. white's suggestion	flattered but he did not like the identity	375.27815071787984
3868. he did not spill over with	hatred for the enemy	565.050969237475
3869. he hadn't even seen him yet h   pressing	his cigarette out in the earth warren walked to the slit and	scanned the jagged hills	2466.4818883575854
3870. he saw no life but still stood there for	a time peering at the unlovely hills his gaze continually returning to	papa-san	3259.460158387867
3871. he had come here in order to test himself	260.6788059584622
3872. while most of	his beliefs were still unsettled he knew that he did not believe in	killing	2091.56937879451
3873. he had come because he could not live out	his life feeling that he had been a coward	1572.2488114794442
3874. there were ten men	on the patrol which sergeant prevot led out that next night	1637.8282875998411
3875. the	beaming rok was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another	man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition	1734.1943837883687
3876. warren and white each	carried in addition to their own weapons and ammo a box of ammo for	the rok's machine gun	3261.6188905158033
3877. others carried extra clips for the	browning automatic rifle which was in the hands of a little mexican	named martinez	1879.5798553881305
3878. prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon	389.8894986707979
3879. we just sit quiet and wait prevot had said	261.7963373067872
3880. be sure the	man nearest you is awake	251.81071260266168
3881. if joe doesn't show up we'll all be	back here at 0600 hours	789.328441042024
3882. otherwise we hold a reception	22.366162716075547
3883. then we pull	out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody pulls out until	i say so	1568.5234017129385
3884. remember what i said about going out to get anybody left	behind	950.962989796458
3885. that still holds	0.20041515
3886. we bring back all dead and wounded	141.00135214802276
3887. at 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the	point of departure	1090.7718577143346
3888. then began the journey through their own mine fields	391.7243744976438
3889. ours were kinder than theirs some said	93.64187175256298
3890. they set bouncing	betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully	had them go off at the head	3286.930776524439
3891. the crude	wooden boxes of the enemy our nicely turned gray metal disks	791.4408110893794
3892. but	theirs defied the detectors	22.397426898254196
3893. a foot misplaced a leg missing	43.95497399288234
3894. all sizes: big ones some wired to set off a whole field	little ones hand grenade size	2125.088116496354
3895. booby traps to fill the head with	chunks of metal	375.96001984373777
3896. warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by	looking at the sky	1650.2582312134055
3897. prevot had said that the searchlights	would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours which gives us time	to get settled in position	2458.4225237176483
3898. because they were new men and	to be sure that they didn't get lost prevot had placed warren	and white in the center of the patrol as it filed out	4799.611371725661
3899. his eyes now	fixed on white's solid figure warren could hear behind him the tread	of another	1421.335923157342
3900. he could also hear the stream which he had seen from	his position	1192.4245237092944
3901. they were going to follow it for part of their journey	494.483336766749
3902. it's safe prevot had said and it provides cover for our	noise	963.7883322688015
3903. soon they were picking their way along the edge of	the stream which glowed in the night	1419.84486483916
3904. on their right rose the embankment	covered with brush and trees	754.3126019439957
3905. if a branch extended out too far	each man held it back for the next and if they met a low overhang each	warned the other	2727.194426108563
3906. thus stealthily they advanced upstream; then	they turned to the right climbed the embankment and walked into the	valley again	2830.2117792920017
3907. there was no cover here only grass sighing against	pant-legs	376.51882804917864
3908. and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert	the grass stripped something from warren	2599.918970680346
3909. the gentle whir of each footstep	left him more naked than before until he felt his unprotected	flesh tremble chilled by each new sound	2455.813119528045
3910. the shapes of the men ahead	of him lacked solidity as if the whip had stripped them of their very	flesh	3059.42348940744
3911. the dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage	their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords	1565.380824352674
3912. the warped broken	trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes	559.9038528583849
3913. clumps of brush that	they passed were so many enchained demons straining	in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones	2020.0442622183655
3914. looming over all papa-san	leered down at him threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies	1185.2559020339888
3915. off in	the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky	792.5220646017814
3916. the	sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a	softer diffused radiance	2363.2196695920366
3917. somewhere over there another patrol had need	of light	261.51154925887835
3918. warren thought of all the men out that night who like	himself had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their	guts- picked their way into the area beyond	4840.812773988421
3919. from the east to the west	coast of the korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled	men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night	sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting	amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts	4825.585535796061
3920. white's arm went	up and warren raised his own	392.2889404416791
3921. prevot	came up take that spot over there he whispered pointing to	a small clump of blackness	1406.7498524077228
3922. give me your machine gun ammo	65.37120046783483
3923. warren	handed him the metal box and prevot quietly disappeared down the	line	789.8842088642705
3924. lying in the grass behind the brush clump warren looked	about	753.7228080708749
3925. the others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and	the brush	645.258728610303
3926. over his shoulder he could see prevot with the machine gun	crew	968.0540342762272
3927. even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting	up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the	heads of the rest of the patrol	3550.152571438731
3928. warren eased his rifle's	safety off and gently slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from	one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with	an x	5005.376995724207
3929. this he placed within quick reach	43.77312158312019
3930. the walk and his fears	had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch	of the night air	3291.7686230830177
3931. although the armored vest fitted the upper part	of his body snugly he felt no security	1254.7140452630308
3932. figures seemed to crouch in	the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed	to advance and retreat even as he watched	4287.321756462714
3933. certain this menace was	only imaginary he yet stared in fascinated horror his hand sticky against	the stock of his weapon	2031.874503468763
3934. he was aware of insistent inner beatings	as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body	2118.7920159159667
3935. above the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds	diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light	1890.9231748091795
3936. then the figures	which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing	like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene	3251.5294439726044
3937. even so he could	not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself	seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax	2982.3839624743646
3938. sensing the	unseen presence of the other men in the patrol he felt mutely united	to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him	4095.8731411606727
3939. he sensed something precious in the perilous moment something akin	to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the french countryside	a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness	2869.690270862164
3940. in france	he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown	up to the sky and always as he wandered he felt a stranger to their	exultation	5041.737384906151
3941. they were poems in a strange language of which he could	barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire	for the fullness he sensed there	3218.925707078261
3942. brittany that stone-gray mystery	through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the barns of	farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he	knew and it was in brittany that he had met pierre	6180.472442385921
3943. pierre	had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists	502.39863558507193
3944. with leather cups	fitted in his handlebars he steered his bicycle	747.5582653623972
3945. he and warren had	traveled together for four days	261.135326981528
3946. they visited the shipyards at brest	and pierre had to sign the register vouching for the integrity of	the visiting foreigner	3049.4359288380974
3947. he took the pen in his stumps and began to	write	502.97334588087386
3948. wait! wait! cried the guard who ran from the	hut to shout to other men standing about outside	2364.09254320928
3949. they crowded the small	room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless	man write his name in the book	2193.5998520432045
3950. c'est merveilleux	0.30041514999999996
3951. and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments	on his having overcome his infirmity	1418.6308998392199
3952. doesn't it	ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking	you about your hands	2126.3304706020263
3953. oh the french are a very curious	people pierre had laughed	509.3622669719551
3954. they are also honest seekers	after truth	141.47141095273443
3955. now the english are painfully silent about my missing	hands	376.6195516349836
3956. they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there	954.216085626042
3957. the	americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful	but don't ask questions	1406.0389565573278
3958. i'm used to all three but i think	the french have the healthiest attitude	1411.3699244610455
3959. that was the day	that pierre had told warren about the abbey of solesmes	942.7674350046843
3960. you	are looking tired and there you can rest	392.1661770714669
3961. it will be good for you	43.59617795933257
3962. i think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will	find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you	have spoken	4288.417342699418
3963. within two weeks warren was ringing the bell	at the abbey gate	645.6139295539813
3964. the monk who opened the door immediately calmed his	worries about his reception: i speak english the old man	said but i do not hear it very well	4464.549184807709
3965. he smiled and stuck a large	finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that	might help	2030.4959875593352
3966. smiling at warren's protestations the old monk took	his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor	3289.6666094884204
3967. will	you please wait in here	43.59879657399479
3968. mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next	to the funeral parlor on pennsylvania avenue	2351.3972029858974
3969. al's little cafe	was small dark narrow and filled with the mingled scent of beer	tobacco smoke and italian cooking	1878.2692711243246
3970. hanging over the bar was an oil	painting of a nude al had accepted from a student at the corcoran	gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke	4852.827150992622
3971. the nude was small	and black-haired and elfin and was called eloise	637.2463596671371
3972. this	was one place where moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without	anyone noticing him or at least coming up and hanging around and	wanting to know all the low-down	5513.038844268548
3973. the other patrons were taxi drivers	and art students and small shopkeepers	638.0449585502478
3974. the reporters had not yet	discovered that this was his hideaway	743.5880513192958
3975. his friend jane was with	him	43.48837530367403
3976. she was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even	if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint	3689.2088859790974
3977. she was the widow	of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and mickie had found	her a job as head of the historical section of the treasury	3225.8213632228453
3978. this	meant sorting out press clippings and the like	392.4261947238341
3979. jane sat receptive	and interested	14.87835937743508
3980. mickie had a pleasant glow as he said you see	both of them i mean the president and jeff lawrence are romantics	3279.3824369155946
3981. a romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and	all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and	altruism will appear	3238.820906683168
3982. it's like focusing a camera; the distant ship	isn't there until you get the focus	1650.2005667772087
3983. you know what i'm talking	about	43.59653991241649
3984. i'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live	with them	1406.1525663272657
3985. but when it comes to war the colonel knows what	it is and jeff doesn't	1094.8958092113921
3986. mr christiansen knows that a soldier	will get the distinguished service medal for conduct that would land	him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian	4663.383018063614
3987. he had	a mean unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the	name trig for him	1572.5488337735064
3988. that's to say he was trigger happy	140.46253577735743
3989. he'd	shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry	1421.0139943351849
3990. he was a wiry inscrutable silent country boy from the red clay of	rural alabama and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally	make fun of	4477.743066952077
3991. but not in front of trig	43.23441172899141
3992. i heard of some that tried	it back in the states and he'd knock them clear across the room	2580.097895862365
3993. there'd been a pretty bad incident back at the marine base	504.11637248471516
3994. a new	york kid a refugee from one of the harlem gangs made fun of trig's	accent and drew a knife	3062.0827392528995
3995. before the fight was over the harlem	boy had a concussion and trig was cut up badly	1417.4478167065258
3996. they caught trig	stealing liquor from the officers' mess and he got a couple of girls	in trouble	2375.406643434782
3997. the fear of punishment just didn't bother him	167.11198340846644
3998. it was left out of him at birth	248.65470213913414
3999. this is why he made such	a magnificent soldier	262.3808652279844
4000. he wasn't troubled with the ordinary rank-and-file	fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers	and whole companies under fire running in panic	3684.781408877624
4001. it just didn't	occur to trig that anything serious would happen to him	782.9153396900942
4002. do you get	the picture of the kind of fellow he was	954.949992897716
4003. jane nodded	with a pleasant smile	43.86464986767821
4004. there was a sniper's nest	in a mountain cave and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy	2591.0827601301203
4005. the colonel ordered that it be wiped out and i suggested	'you ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a quart	of whisky ten dollars and a week-end pass to davao'	3647.6117426994724
4006. trig was	one of the five volunteers	140.78681466004466
4007. the patrol snaked around in back of the cave	approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls	1871.4050642197133
4008. you could hear them from our outpost	140.40279727416322
4009. there was a lot of shooting	42.937204616875476
4010. we knew the enemy was subdued because a flare was fired as the signal	1420.1382307337485
4011. two of our men were killed a third was wounded	373.6139182490398
4012. trig and a very black colored boy from detroit had killed or put	out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting	3487.3079647989384
4013. when	we got there trig and the negro were quarreling over possession	of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino	2319.547216415603
4014. the colored	boy had it and trig lunged at him with a knife and said 'give	that to me you black bastard	3263.453881923675
4015. we don't 'low nigras to walk on	the same sidewalk with white men where i come from'	1420.1513219114254
4016. the	negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound	1188.9863254449149
4017. what	did the colonel do about the men	168.41309089836233
4018. jane asked in her placid	interested way	140.15958888396125
4019. he recommended both of	them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple heart	too for a combat-inflicted wound	2028.5115353909223
4020. so you see mr christiansen	knows what it's all about	560.3509906679659
4021. when he was in	the war he was in law or supplies or something like that and an	old buddy of his told me he would come down on sundays to the pentagon	and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for	trig- and go away with a real glow	5274.9281551172535
4022. these were heroes nine feet	tall to him	249.4168238850496
4023. jefferson lawrence was alone at the small perfectly	appointed table by the window looking out over the river	1571.6523336754683
4024. he	had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern	of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with	two heads	4640.400309800616
4025. open beside him was mrs dalloway	43.64879779205496
4026. he thought how	this dainty fragile older woman threading her way through the streets	of westminster on a day in june enjoying the flowers in the shops	the greetings from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate	breath was so like himself	6812.1169884508245
4027. he and mrs dalloway too	had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the	bone marrow of the spirit	2194.876026900013
4028. he had not because he was both poor	and ambitious	562.4938814765012
4029. poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious	261.3406893735895
4030. they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars	along a dark country lane	2830.2460847818215
4031. no they must look the other way and climb	one more painful step up the ladder	1267.2559080440847
4032. he made the decision with his	eyes open or so he thought	963.742335091911
4033. at any cost he must leave the dreary pennsylvania	mining town where his father was a pharmacist	1415.737698309563
4034. and so he	had so he had	142.47286084565607
4035. at state college he had no time to walk among the	violets on the water's edge	1261.3041033899888
4036. from his room he could look out in springtime	and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly deliciously	across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal winds	4829.3148566369855
4037. he was not unmoved	2.9419253025379386
4038. he had to teach himself patiently that	these traps were not for him	1179.1608724170496
4039. he must mentally pull the blinds and	close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him	2036.2532695358957
4040. at law school the same	22.284262123929846
4041. more of this stamping down of human emotion	as a young lawyer in new york	1101.5689566744616
4042. by the time he was prosperous enough-	his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women	2354.4304814428506
4043. the only	one who would have him was his cripple the strange unhappy woman	who became his wife	1564.433533333162
4044. perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just	249.380099187195
4045. he	had dared to defy nature to turn his back to the lorelei and he was	punished	1414.1257977018552
4046. like mrs dalloway with her regrets about peter walsh	he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent	3058.2111044693957
4047. if	he had had a son he would tell him gather ye rosebuds while ye	may h this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying	2850.373681998732
4048. but then his son could afford it	140.4258850428789
4049. lawrence was waiting for bill	boxell	43.36115462932496
4050. the vice president had called and asked if he could see	the secretary at his home	1891.314936465726
4051. he said the matter was urgent	43.814041390667136
4052. the secretary	was uneasy about the visit	141.81943543490408
4053. he did not like boxell	14.954189908890797
4054. he suspected	something underhanded and furtive about him	253.2605618776664
4055. lawrence could not	put his finger on it precisely and this worried him	787.8885265823026
4056. when you disliked	or distrusted a man you should have a reason	966.8016639010559
4057. human nature was	not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell	1249.2824784034933
4058. lawrence stared	a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his	dislike of the vice president would appear	3474.6189778590806
4059. therefore	he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort	to understand and sympathize with his point of view	2467.7008455474615
4060. a half	hour later the vice president arrived	249.94944357574872
4061. he looked very carefully at	every piece of furnishing as though hoping to store this information	carefully in his mind	1886.0200530514044
4062. he observed the florentine vase in the hall	the renoir painting in the library as well as the long shelves of well-bound	volumes; the pattern of the oriental rug the delicate cut-glass	chandelier	5324.520873389428
4063. he said to the secretary i understand	you came from a little pennsylvania town near wilkes-barre	1265.097863256932
4064. how did	you find out about this	139.8084380321614
4065. he waved his arm around at the furnishings	167.93123574385885
4066. it was not a discourteous question lawrence decided	250.09833850819004
4067. this young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious;	he had to find out	1730.4722703491036
4068. the secretary did not tell him at what cost at	what loneliness he learned these things	1881.3613490406733
4069. he merely said any good	decorator these days can make you a tasteful home	946.7689611897638
4070. the vice	president said if you hear of any names that would fix me cheap	in return for advertising they decorated the vice president's	home let me know	4451.372985510955
4071. i can do business with that kind	93.40939416405237
4072. again	lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and	ambition	1417.3090667806014
4073. boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously	373.7504977199323
4074. he	had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years	1177.2658890143712
4075. they	had brandy in the library	43.35051012967843
4076. boxell looked at lawrence with a searching	glance the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial	2831.713845197356
4077. what are your weaknesses	2.948539694277348
4078. where will you break	4.396286820867516
4079. how best to	destroy your peace	43.47482507938982
4080. the vice president said with a slight	bluster there isn't anyone who loves the president more than	i do	2607.308356338061
4081. old chris is my ideal	14.82786549130957
4082. at the same time you have to face facts	and realize that a man who's been in the marine corps all his	life doesn't understand much about politics	4469.45507689888
4083. what does a monk know	about sex	94.97440836715906
4084. lawrence listened with the practiced deceptive	calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow	2124.150935943869
4085. so	we have to protect the old man for his own good	642.6820450644166
4086. you see what i mean	22.250996032930217
4087. congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with	them you have to be politic	1719.0622005818102
4088. this is why i say we just can't go ahead	and disarm the germans and pull down our own defenses	2832.962513397959
4089. let me tell	you what happened to me today	259.9763307114498
4090. a fellow came up to me a senator	i don't have to tell you his name and he told me 'i love the	president like a brother but god damn it he's crucifying me	5479.487532807927
4091. i've	got a quarter of a million germans in my state and those krautheads	tune in on father werther every night and if he tells them to	go out and piss in the public square that's what they do	4141.614706952708
4092. he's	telling them now to write letters to their congressmen opposing the disarmament	of germany'	1638.1451351816972
4093. and another one comes to me and he says 'look	here there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people	making uniforms for the navy	2733.260888206335
4094. the bishop looked at him coldly and said take it or leave it!	literally there was nothing else to do	2800.878231242121
4095. he was caught in	a machine	43.78326066868041
4096. but sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite	calmly: let's go and see what it's like	2597.831230405633
4097. annisberg	was about seventy-five miles west of birmingham near the georgia	border and on the tallahoosa river a small and dirty stream	2184.041369915219
4098. the	city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also	because of the beauty of some of its surroundings a residence for many	owners of the great industries in north alabama	5307.935020763913
4099. but it had as was	usual in southern cities of this sort a black bottom a low region	near the river where the negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled	together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets	and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime	5134.288296662242
4100. wilson came by train from birmingham and looked the city	over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief	stores were	3905.3277218654534
4101. beyond were industries and factories	14.868011142981436
4102. then they went down	to black bottom	140.57907608090633
4103. in the midst of this crowded region was the allen	african methodist episcopal church	939.9755768034578
4104. it was an old and dirty	wooden structure sadly in need of repair	1180.283818626858
4105. but it was a landmark	14.869789657694117
4106. it	had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white	knew of it	2355.390679962417
4107. it had just suffered a calamity the final crisis in a	long series of calamities	1100.6195925223547
4108. for the old preacher who had been there twenty-five	years was dead and the city mourned him	2125.3926527760514
4109. he was a	loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength	and ability	1415.7147721291685
4110. he was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious	and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly	supported the church	3494.71941228821
4111. the deacon board headed by a black man	named carlson had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and	had its way with the support of the amen corner	3234.989358660677
4112. the characteristic	thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious	orgy	1648.713596731827
4113. a knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a	sermon	646.844043195151
4114. it began invariably in low tones almost conversational and	then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to god and man	3030.70902363553
4115. and	then the amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation	in worship that stemmed from years before the greek chorus spreading	down through the african forest overseas to the west indies	and then here in alabama	4144.818693397458
4116. with shout and slow dance with tears and	song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria	and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed	like an alien and outside force	5640.218613297927
4117. it spread to most of the audience	and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief	and afterward discussed negro religion	2312.045026557506
4118. it sometimes ended in	death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and	floor	1882.9811411661801
4119. to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent	and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week	to week	2591.3703896218462
4120. it was often re-enacted in less wild form at the wednesday	night prayer meeting	1413.989241025514
4121. wilson on his first sunday witnessed	this with something like disgust	502.5161098283482
4122. he had preached a short sermon	trying to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what	he had done in macon and birmingham and what he proposed to do here	5477.554148887446
4123. he sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor	502.94598380293866
4124. but then	at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose	959.0106829229251
4125. he had no	chance to say another word	165.98835174597053
4126. at the very end when the audience was silent	and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone	filed out	3027.640632165544
4127. the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what	the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to	say	2970.9915832491074
4128. during the next weeks he looked over the situation	392.63822304915266
4129. first	of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized	people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not	repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot	3659.8485356448728
4130. it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old	members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found	was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue	and fierce initiative	6686.59823825011
4131. ann catt was a lonely devoted soul	never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but	a perpetual dissenter and born critic	2600.9826281196883
4132. she soared over the new pastor	like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all	the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository	4858.428477345107
4133. then	wilson looked over the church and studied its condition	377.0783660644542
4134. the salary	of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears	2125.2600683700134
4135. wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2500	but when he mentioned this to the deacons they said nothing	2314.560954609101
4136. the church	itself must be repaired	64.68438119499095
4137. it was dirty and neglected	14.963097712553093
4138. it really	ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks	about this	2821.2235704640243
4139. meanwhile the city itself should be talked to	166.76652466620496
4140. the	streets in the colored section were dirty	249.30107089229585
4141. there was typhoid and malaria	14.857648375212396
4142. the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks	1418.2728454415287
4143. the school was small dark and ill-equipped	93.70828176637158
4144. the teacher was	a pliant fool	65.52856587485621
4145. there were two liquor saloons not very far from the	church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance	for negroes; the other exclusively negro	3117.728310869771
4146. undoubtedly there	was a good deal of gambling in both	560.5629935969998
4147. on the other side of the	church	was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted	1424.8678120415852
4148. it was called kent house	22.21711825909112
4149. the deacon of the	church carlson was its janitor	260.9586316663315
4150. one of the leading members of the	amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed	there	2795.103594612636
4151. wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people	which seemed to him rather queer	1717.0945559077252
4152. why should a white hotel be set	down in the center of black bottom	1412.56203546603
4153. but nevertheless it looked respectable	14.933306545908627
4154. he was glad to have it there	139.20816012011443
4155. the rest of black	bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair	and careful upkeep	1874.4390432720404
4156. dives carefully repaired huts and nicely	painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl	with little distinction	2586.65319953487
4157. the best could not escape from the worst and	the worst nestled cosily beside the better	1264.2452044629765
4158. the yards front and back	were narrow; some were trash dumps some had flower gardens	1644.763419883679
4159. behind	were privies for there was no sewage system	259.7759036433243
4160. after looking	about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river	and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land	and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might	gradually be moved to this plot	6908.035343043426
4161. he talked about it to the presiding	elder	167.06030496318675
4162. the presiding elder looked him over rather carefully	252.25451091060944
4163. he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand	782.7122204696867
4164. but there was one	thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the	general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling	behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately	6213.872460209538
4165. in	fact he intimated clearly that that was the reason that wilson had	been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money	2451.048658591322
4166. wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a	better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization	and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship	into a modern church organization	6677.798052396414
4167. he emphasized to the presiding	elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the	river	1734.919160550847
4168. the presiding elder was sure that that would be impossible	557.3981739852413
4169. but he told wilson to go ahead and try	260.7931608332169
4170. it did seem impossible	4.428939018104305
4171. the bank which held the mortgage on the	old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and	the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was	being held for an eventual development for white working people who	were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk	5244.427660617629
4172. when it	was proposed to rebuild the church wilson found that the terms for	a new mortgage were very high	2819.004218962202
4173. he was sure that he could do better if	he went to atlanta to get the deal financed	1577.1062257644444
4174. but when this proposal	was made to his deacon board he met unanimous opposition	1408.7561675272032
4175. the	church certainly would not be removed	93.66106425156629
4176. the very proposition was sacrilege	22.1874889909711
4177. it had been here fifty years	43.886279081435276
4178. it was going to stay forever	64.68811566154203
4179. it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject	500.67751332165847
4180. as for	rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no	hurry at all	2348.3334851887525
4181. wilson again went downtown to a different banker	an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but	he shook his head	2164.945303033398
4182. reverend he said i think you don't	quite understand the situation here	965.7957187265526
4183. don't you see the amount	of money that has been invested by whites around that church	1254.8342081780097
4184. tenements	stores saloons some gambling i hope not too much	561.1090797256196
4185. the colored	people are getting employment at kent house and other places and	they are near their places of employment	1875.271654449471
4186. when a city has arranged	things like this you cannot easily change them	1187.7501068997462
4187. now if i were you i	would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or	ten years	2344.432089958951
4188. by that time perhaps something better can be done	391.9185639528956
4189. then wilson asked what about this kent house which you	mention	501.02806764305933
4190. i don't understand why a white hotel should be down here	757.294747976169
4191. the young banker looked at him with a certain surprise and	then he said flatly: i'm afraid i can't tell you anything	in particular about kent house	2870.2908043144967
4192. you'll have to find out about it	on your own	559.143433294076
4193. hope to see you again	14.910901904999895
4194. and he dismissed the colored	pastor	65.62734595772912
4195. it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside	him and took his hand	1099.1554387976623
4196. she said my dear do you know what kent	house is	755.5948388625719
4197. no said wilson i don't	14.802631964138005
4198. i was	just asking about it	65.49046872789472
4199. what is it	0.20041515
4200. it's a house of prostitution	for white men with white girls as inmates	1184.8926777432494
4201. they hire	a good deal of local labor including two members of our trustee board	1090.2685884994212
4202. they buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized	by some of the best white gentlemen in town	3063.163013618654
4203. my dear you must be mistaken	43.49900348750211
4204. talk to	mrs catt she said	65.28609690362185
4205. and after wilson had talked to mrs	catt and to others he was absolutely amazed	1099.6104628361388
4206. this of course was	the sort of thing that used to take place in southern cities- putting	white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods	and carrying them on openly	5157.973929777489
4207. but it had largely disappeared on	account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the	part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages	3340.545722201006
4208. but this situation of kent house was more subtle	388.7034991626668
4209. the wages	involved were larger and more regular	165.89048410800862
4210. the inmates were white and	from out of town avoiding local friction	958.9048772937655
4211. the backing from the white	town was greater and there was little publicity	785.6723991671543
4212. good wages patronage	and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes	1180.2601545568978
4213. and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go	791.8909763708687
4214. and	for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean	practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not	in all churches	4469.527093807533
4215. payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold	508.65948970541666
4216. there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night	760.0816002373946
4217. two gas	lamps were no more than a misleading glow	374.2456968365624
4218. he might have been anywhere	or nowhere	140.91611702010968
4219. the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription	from dr verdi	642.5697491902595
4220. secretary of state seward was a sick man	251.0010253327263
4221. the idea had come from herold who had once been a chemist's clerk	792.571030970634
4222. the sick were always receiving medicines	65.22909905776417
4223. no one would question	such an errand	93.90429881168906
4224. the bottle was filled up with flour	140.32131955667538
4225. before payne	loomed the old clubhouse seward's home where key had once	been killed	946.588218663248
4226. now it would have another death	64.76618386971205
4227. from the outside it	was an ordinary enough house of the gentry	637.4838833711344
4228. he clomped heavily up the	stoop and rang the bell	565.988795297169
4229. like the bell at mass the doorbell was pitched	too high	501.97615142106287
4230. it was still good friday after all	140.86675027803315
4231. a nigger	boy opened the door	43.283501540828354
4232. payne did not notice him	22.306962832459117
4233. he was thinking chiefly	of cap	43.52384748819204
4234. if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point	in wasting time	1171.7722221363924
4235. he pushed his way inside	14.711168319520038
4236. for a moment	the hall confused him	142.06709359806248
4237. this was the largest house he had ever been in	almost the largest building except for a hotel	1572.8445105841754
4238. he had no idea where	seward's room would be	392.7222370537355
4239. in the half darkness the banisters gleamed	and the hall seemed enormous	646.0835509676873
4240. above him somewhere were the bedrooms	65.25630770022102
4241. seward would be up there	14.748048281420159
4242. he explained his errand but without	bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well	up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army	4807.284128996746
4243. he did not	really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when	the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched	yourself giving way to it	3855.670114488365
4244. he was no longer worried	22.167307505625338
4245. everything would	be all right	14.799367857029358
4246. he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped	748.1724282631685
4247. still the sensation always surprised him	43.41478489528401
4248. it was a thrill he	felt no part in	390.25746179415466
4249. he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while	his body did these quick appalling and efficient things	1884.9039365022848
4250. he	brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs	964.2472558402163
4251. they	were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great	clodhoppers he wore	1269.7569640760046
4252. the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled	drum	561.0812945381189
4253. at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there	angrily in a dressing gown	1417.7771709110752
4254. he stopped and whispered his errand	65.00041631790323
4255. young frederick seward held out his hand	92.4046563776414
4256. panting a little payne	shook his head	140.7127373212693
4257. dr verdi had told him to deliver his package in	person	497.7242405290002
4258. frederick seward said his father was sleeping and then	went through a pantomime at his father's door to prove the statement	3032.407710468723
4259. i will go	0.20041515
4260. he smiled	but now that he knew where the elder seward was he did not intend	to go	2355.3265464238784
4261. he pulled out his pistol and fired it	166.98279664545692
4262. it	had misfired	0.30041514999999996
4263. reversing it he smashed the butt down on frederick	seward's head over and over again	1104.7907773558466
4264. it was the first blow	that was always difficult	389.0652393824697
4265. after that violence was exultantly easy	43.813386405950766
4266. he got caught up into it and became a different person	752.9927720401745
4267. only afterwards	did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over	it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real	2856.7701449761494
4268. the nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming murder	396.9490346754523
4269. it was not murder at all	43.515507639020214
4270. payne was more methodical than that	65.11726496195512
4271. he	was merely clearing a way to what he had to do	642.0872161347818
4272. he ran for the	sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away	1650.7317449316029
4273. from childhood he had known all about knives	168.37015654329412
4274. someone blocked	the door from inside	65.10267484713766
4275. he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness	167.23441354924472
4276. he saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled	and fled	1631.2090870111956
4277. he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could	repeatedly	947.6917921799698
4278. it was like finally getting into one's own nightmares	to punish one's dreams	1178.8304584599914
4279. two men pulled him off	14.9357448301664
4280. payne hacked at their arms	22.214534064195398
4281. there was a lady there in	a nightdress	167.23168511157425
4282. he would not have wanted to hurt a lady	393.40240529678965
4283. another man	approached this one fully dressed	93.57561678562261
4284. when the knife went into his chest	he went down at once	963.2872574306757
4285. i'm mad shouted payne as	he ran out into the hall	505.24361368531515
4286. i'm mad and only wished he had been	253.12266767017385
4287. that would have made things so much easier	167.64622863030294
4288. but he was not mad	22.198137256540452
4289. he clattered down the stairs and out of	the door	373.2449131690081
4290. somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder	755.6051499547375
4291. one always wakes up even from one's own dreams	263.65951794500495
4292. the clammy air	revived him	22.40957208272112
4293. herold he saw had fled	14.893469099551169
4294. well one did not expect	much of people like herold	558.79898050572
4295. he unhitched his horse walked	it away mounted and spurred it on	644.4222574925705
4296. the nigger boy was close	behind him	140.56729279543933
4297. then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone	376.3439522460988
4298. he rode	on and on	22.309672719227997
4299. he had no idea where he was	93.62953853587913
4300. after some time he came to	an open field	395.3280384361486
4301. an open field was better than a building that was for	sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the	grass	2471.818454143416
4302. he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away;	he knew he should get to cap but he didn't know how	3041.777277959501
4303. he was sure	for he had done as he was told hadn't he	789.9474436408974
4304. cap would find him	and take care of him	392.1439935528203
4305. so choosing a good tree he clambered up into it	found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled	bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited	with honey	4039.172470684389
4306. violence always made him tired but he was not	frightened	559.7151744566083
4307. in boston edwin booth was winding up a performance	of a new way to pay old debts	1409.4504174462145
4308. it was a part so familiar	to him that he did not bother to think about it any more	2574.9727335586454
4309. on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge	by the applause he must be doing it better than usual	2459.0592335922966
4310. as	sir giles overreach	he raised his arm and declaimed: where	is my honour now	1648.452102883095
4311. that was one of the high spots of the	play	372.82291574526596
4312. the audience as usual loved it	65.01347780547117
4313. he was delighted to see them	so happy	167.6513328360391
4314. if he had any worries it was only the small ones about	mother in new york and his daughter edwina and what she might be	doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia	5618.7074810365775
4315. everyone	is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long	enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all	those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that	was largely though not entirely up to you	4754.395229359036
4316. they made the	world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not	1183.5993013947655
4317. wilkes	was quite right about one thing	94.83432188796027
4318. laura keene had been in the	green room	251.1561888062719
4319. the commotion had brought her into the wings	167.607211404075
4320. since she	could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was	the first person to offer mr lincoln a glass of water holding	it	up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for	it	7093.508493020328
4321. she had been one of the first to collect her wits	499.1828233518763
4322. it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that	they had been stunned already	2606.143390105043
4323. most of them had seen our american	cousin before and unless miss keene was on stage there was not	much to it	2167.0497219574777
4324. the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom	557.6698768630038
4325. the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star	monologue	791.3282525180213
4326. the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear	in or out of character but he was not particularly funny	3248.321890075217
4327. at the end	of the monologue the audience would applaud	377.22512613540624
4328. meanwhile it looked at	the scenery	65.63880933701259
4329. well i guess i know enough to turn you inside	out you sockdologizing old mantrap! said trenchard otherwise	hawk	1726.3953440075663
4330. there was always a pause here before the next line	561.3166787227877
4331. that was when the gun went off	94.55328323227111
4332. yet even that explosion did not mean	much	248.46247722652416
4333. guns were going off all over washington city these days because	of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof	1886.0409682671245
4334. then	the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential	box	1887.9528356003389
4335. sic semper tyrannis it said mildly	43.27533846238485
4336. booth	had delivered his line	22.074100981777853
4337. behind him billowed a small pungent cloud	of smoke	261.55716303861027
4338. they had not heard what had	been said	249.7356591633023
4339. they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily	782.8907390534112
4340. the figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag	draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell	on its hands and pressed itself up	5312.148652550527
4341. harry hawk still had his	arm raised towards the wings	375.7874094334664
4342. he did not lower	his arm	64.97002500421895
4343. the figure was so theatrically dressed that it was	as though	a character from some other play had blundered into this one	2188.1781979224606
4344. the	play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon	1410.9901304207178
4345. this figure looked like the slave dealer from that	262.86826396279287
4346. but it	also looked like a toad hopping away from the light	973.3781906248972
4347. there was something	maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them	639.2818977700197
4348. then	it disappeared into the wings	65.67750842098724
4349. harry hawk had not shifted	position but he at last lowered his arm	785.1814348269819
4350. there was no mistaking that scream	65.10462716020285
4351. it was what anyone who had ever	seen her had always expected her to do	1096.4474443937697
4352. yet this scream had a different	note in it	392.45637815995
4353. that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them	awake like a pail of water	947.8241955923288

4548. i hear the whole bunch is croakin	out in the snow	753.4548458862629
4549. they'll get the guys that done it h there	was something troubling him though: as yet they hadn't h	five days h keerist h prickly twinges of annoyance ran through	him	3338.472730897572
4550. his eyes blinked hard snapping on and squashing some bad things	that were	trying to push their way into him	2824.4094016581657
4551. a tune began to whirl	inside his head	166.11242401669315
4552. one of his favorites: guitar boogie	65.47373102816205
4553. it	always came on faithfully just like a radio or juke box whenever he	started to worry too much about something when the bad things tried	to push their way into him	3464.0302501172846
4554. the music drove them off or away and he	was free to walk on air in a very few moments humming and jiving within	beating the rhythm within	4498.655278533892
4555. he glowed with anticipation about what	would happen to the culprits when they caught them h turn the	bastards over to me- to me and my boys- no nigger ever got what would	be comin to them- reactionary bastards h	4220.365604529207
4556. he had never heard	the word reactionary before his life as a pow began	1423.051581610654
4557. it was	a word he was proud of a word that meant much to him and he used it	with great pleasure almost as if it were an exclusive possession and	more: he sensed himself to be very highly educated four cuts above	any of the folks back home h four cuts at least he chuckled	to himself and i owe it all to them	5735.656677560093
4558. the word also	made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled	1190.4192635153374
4559. he used it very	effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball	1094.8160641966683

4564. he saw himself before them	delivering the speech	250.21336682530304
4565. he laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power	telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving	utmost respect and attention	2454.199440807889
4566. one day ching had told him	as they walked to the weekly conference	of squad leaders keep it up your squad is good one of the best	keep it up keep up the good work	5633.842161680537

4575. the thought came back the one nagging	at him these past four days	795.3727441874304
4576. he tried to stifle it	22.124524929678167
4577. but the words were	forming	14.649057895097789
4578. he braced himself h somebody'll	hafta start thinkin h he fought it seeking to kill the last	few words but on they came h bout takin- his h he was	trembling a strange feeling upon him fully expecting some catastrophe	to strike him dead on the spot	7154.135696311487

4624. see he's already snapping it up the dumb jerk	h coughlin grinned feeling supremely on top of things h he watched	the snow once again	3914.335043762732
4625. it made no sense to him	h he whirled around suddenly hot all over finding the man who had	been standing before him a few moments back nailing him to the spot	on which he now stood open-mouthed-   you- listen!-	name william foster's four internal contradictions in capitalism	4843.704627663987
4626. quick- quick- now!   the man shrank before	the hot fury searching frantically for the answer h   finnegan	woke up	2598.6075363677733
4627. there was a hell of a noise this time of morning	501.8070230547434
4628. he stared	out the window	22.418848295763578
4629. for christ's sake! the whole fucken sky's	caved in! he looked for the source of the noise that had awakened	him h it was that prick coughlin	2857.048874189699

4641. how long buddy	0.20041515

4656. i	hated the goddamn army from the first day i got in anyhow	1184.3864908181527
4657. all pricks	like coughlin run it anyway one way or another	502.49861523391775
4658. fuck them h he	rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder	1879.64999279387
4659. he snuggled	into the blanket h	brandon dreamed	168.28080876392238
4660. he was sitting	on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water	2124.110870611622
4661. a	river wide as the missouri where it ran by his place	644.2635927125357
4662. but he was not	4.406194923657415
4663. so what	0.20041515
4664. why should i be spinning just	because the goddamn log is spinning	967.9709050444778
4665. 	0.20041515
4666. over on the bank	the west bank a man stood calling to him	1188.5696536740338
4667. he couldn't make out	what he was saying	164.94734071629523
4668. no doubt it had to do with the log	395.2701203416745
4669. why should	he be concerned	14.87123474185547
4670. rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that	he should burn his books too	1886.0817720462965
4671. but while the two men are riding into	the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in	the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything	including most of their clothes	4195.724273710321
4672. you must be a very learned	man says voltaire to one of the bandits	1417.2263698410238
4673. a learned	man	0.20041515
4674. the bandit laughs in his face	64.93654437027473
4675. he goes to the chief himself	43.35875551696758
4676. at what university did you	study	65.37479016861909
4677. he asks	0.20041515
4678. he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never	attended a higher institution	1185.2141379930076
4679. to have become so corrupt he	says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences	1252.7593624232463
4680. the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and shouts	at him that he not only never went to any school but never even	learned how to read	4647.735970068499
4681. when finally the two bedraggled men reach	their friend's home voltaire's fears are once again aroused	1261.1108050807377
4682. for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and	such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner	has become depraved by all this culture	5608.160416879268
4683. to voltaire's surprise	however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his	purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner	2977.524195088475
4684. immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another	favor	556.8686244458596
4685. could he have pen and paper please	94.68583543715624
4686. he is in a hurry	to write another essay against culture	750.5326667362215
4687. such was the impromptu	that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at sans souci and that was	soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of europe	to be printed sometime later but with the name of timon of athens	the famous misanthrope substituted for that of rousseau	4773.692131207318
4688. how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable	389.74329685031387
4689. how could	the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the subterfuges	the lies the frauds the errors sins and even crimes to	which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages	the rich had in the race of life	4761.376845317882
4690. how for example	could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau	would find himself when soon after the furor of his first discourse	he acquired still another title to fame	5309.723055918206
4691. this time	as a musician	14.978882438680012
4692. ever since he had first begun	to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of piercing through	to fame as the result of a successful opera	4473.027850760294
4693. but his facility in	this genre was not great	260.2053260146445
4694. and his efforts to get a performance for his	gallant muses invariably failed	1179.8300079670214
4695. his	operatic music had little merit	43.65420998112129
4696. but then one day while on a	week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler rousseau	amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which	he attached no great importance	5922.073448795321
4697. he was really amazed to discover	the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs	1262.3018046606835
4698. put a few such songs together they urged him	388.20244307469454
4699. string them	onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a delightful operetta	941.7112590071807
4700. nonsense he said	0.30041514999999996
4701. this	is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven	forbid! cried the ladies enchanted by his music	2038.5873748458562
4702. you	must make an opera out of this material	388.97109985103714
4703. and they wouldn't	leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised	640.500597574196
4704. oh	the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years of effort	to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly	replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and sciences	be so close to a success in music and have to reject it	7680.591412063756
4705. or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do	785.5662512040886
4706. you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time	practice them could you	2364.75597686351
4707. well yes perhaps in literature since	you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against	literature and so were involved in spite of yourself	2864.416856652465
4708. but now music	too	4.4335918607354206
4709. no	0.20041515
4710. that would be too much!   and the fault of	course was rameau's	959.1453226117625
4711. the fault was rameau's and that of the whole	culture of this parisian age	938.6917740418783
4712. for it was rameau's type of music	that he had been trying to write and that he couldn't write	2582.404157837568
4713. these	little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender	memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and	that would make one want to weep	3085.7081460245618
4714. he couldn't appear	as a composer now	142.16938893236826
4715. that glory craved for so long was now forbidden	to him	501.9642030635972
4716. still just for the ladies and just for this once for this	one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his	melodies	4291.1726994084365
4717. the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded	260.66489397919594
4718. and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote	965.5655688416751
4719. but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble	amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost	forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript	in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited	4735.010662031206
4720. rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing	there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance	3495.1965123703244
4721. the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him	166.99865963976265
4722. a contradiction	0.30041514999999996
4723. bah what was a contradiction in one's life	167.54943350899504
4724. every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes	and saying yes when she meant no	2819.5844878548805
4725. rousseau had to admit that	though he couldn't agree to a public performance he would indeed	just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work	would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices	4249.211809968852
4726. i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people	seem to think he said	2596.95928099676
4727. duclos the historian pointed	out to jean jacques that this was impossible	633.5741248256932
4728. the musicians of the	royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound	2366.428027109694
4729. merely to satisfy the author's curiosity	43.47110874464789
4730. but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance	of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone	3279.289707328403
4731. duclos understood what was bothering rousseau: that the writer	of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the	writer of an amusing little operetta	2732.4695056067585
4732. that would certainly be paradoxical	22.103572504373012
4733. but duclos thought he saw a way out	166.80312715832753
4734. let me do the	submitting to the royal academy he suggested	750.0135157549216
4735. your name will	never appear	14.787723884136568
4736. no one will even suspect that it is your work	561.5152136109792
4737. to that rousseau could agree	14.966187628602507
4738. but now what crazy twists	and turns of his emotions!   afraid at one and the same time	that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride	even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would	be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would	certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself	0.30166232349522504
4739. and	how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus torn	between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera	and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity	rousseau suffered through several painful weeks	4527.807211029643
4740. all these	emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and	the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian	music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to	inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's	amusements and that he was now demanding that the work be offered	first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau	8811.629639854254
4741. imagine the honor	of it!   what was your answer	257.6519396193347
4742. jean jacques asked	striving to appear unimpressed	139.86223851210596
4743. what else could i do	14.933086423405303
4744. monsieur de cury was incensed of course	140.3152871010462
4745. but i said i would first have to get the author's permission	639.9651167523507
4746. and i was certain he would refuse	142.41624801390648
4747. how infuriating all	this was! why had not this success come to him before he had plunged	into his discourse and before he had committed himself to a life	of austerity and denial	3559.4868577217326
4748. now when everything was opening up to	him- even the court of louis 15!- he had to play a role of	self-effacement	3273.34163325794
4749. back and forth duclos had to go between m	de cury and jean jacques and between the duke d'aumont and jean	jacques again as his little operetta the village soothsayer	though still unperformed took on ever more importance	4041.290204991291
4750. and	of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get	around among his closest friends	2802.7086427653517
4751. but they naturally kept his secret	well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical	and court circles	2320.047951133891
4752. how titillating it was to go among people	who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most	glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first	rehearsals	5758.718932486505
4753. the furor was such that people who could not possibly have	squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were	intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational	3543.810562835994
4754. and	listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of	chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration	trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming	of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself	suddenly as the composer	7552.228737328241
4755. he felt himself now as he himself	says in his confessions at a crucial point of his life	1570.8491747199282
4756. and that	was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal	stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave	4824.86310551318
4757. on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of	several days	1096.9358148320462
4758. seeing him in that condition and about to enter	the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all	the members of the highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the	abbe raynal and others tried to stop him	6585.509109215837
4759. you can't	go in that way! they cried	165.6658998716989
4760. why not	0.30041514999999996
4761. jean jacques	asked	0.20041515
4762. who is going to stop me	64.61510277689536
4763. you haven't dressed	for the occasion! they pointed out to him	499.88165066509754
4764. i'm	dressed as i always am rousseau said	248.02086738253288
4765. at home yes they argued	14.75494331567867
4766. but here you are	in the palace	141.21704577907093
4767. and madame de pompadour	2.965979176822349
4768. if they are here then surely i have the right to be here	rousseau said	1639.3377072571134
4769. since i am the composer!	but in such a slovenly condition	501.4692777201564
4770. what	is slovenly about me	22.188725495883418
4771. rousseau asked	0.20041515
4772. is it because of my slovenliness	that hair grows on my face	954.4371737392405
4773. surely it would grow there	whether	i washed myself or not	502.76035585742466
4774. a hundred years ago i would have worn	a beard with pride	969.8675344652627
4775. and those without beards would have stood out as	not dressed for the occasion	939.1710149167662
4776. now times have changed and i must pretend	that hair doesn't grow on my face	1640.7212530356614
4777. and	fashion is the real king here	94.56510234886221
4778. not louis 15 since even he obeys	141.0034614386834
4779. now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed	946.3578921355744
4780. but of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold	at all	957.7573441597658
4781. he trembled lest his piece should fail	93.71634567315571
4782. and this in addition	to his usual fear of being among people of high society	1636.871907444481
4783. his fear	of making some inane or inappropriate remark	265.6941367774476
4784. and even deeper than	that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to	relieve himself	2577.461622892804
4785. could he walk out in the midst of his piece	372.3700934136957
4786. here	before the court	4.432041953051857
4787. before the king	0.20041515
4788. it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began	1411.1231857527946
4789. the rider from concord was as good as his word	377.3167697782256
4790. he came spurring	and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust	shouting:   they're a-coming! by god they're a-coming	they are!   we heard him before he ever showed and we	heard him yelling after he was out of sight	6585.923302534378
4791. solomon chandler hadn't	misjudged the strength of his lungs not at all	636.2866888710353
4792. i think you could	have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with	importance	2587.2998219386927
4793. i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole	character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd	like as not prefer to eat his meals there	3960.9015824536714
4794. that's understandable	and i appreciate the sentiment	140.12372692851852
4795. as for this rider i never saw	him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted so whether he stood	tall or short in his shoes i can't say; but i do know that	he gave the day tone and distinction	4329.793017662283
4796. the last thing in the world that	resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics	perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel	a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation	6700.996775191548
4797. we came	down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind	it	1730.7317522604594
4798. i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars	but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of	which they are deplorably ignorant	4643.325039068828
4799. whatever we felt about the redcoats	we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing; and	i know that i myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and	that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun	4277.199902581504
4800. i wanted to wipe	my flint but i didn't dare to the state my hands were in just	as i didn't dare to do anything about the priming	4484.6070751232055
4801. the gun would	fire or not just as chance willed	375.1191731491248
4802. i put a lot more trust in my two	legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned	about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it	5789.527055315671
4803. the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the	road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that	brief	interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping	his horse fit to kill	4470.145053127939
4804. i don't know whether he was after our rider	who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions;	but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his	horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction	from which he had come	7797.658894291169
4805. he was a fine and showy rider but his skill	was wasted on us	940.5047175791993
4806. from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked	561.5933085327725
4807. the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the	horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot	caught in the stirrup	2883.424962171004
4808. half crazed by the weight dragging the dust	and the heat the horse leaped our wall dashing out the rider's brains	against it and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse	crashed away through the brush	6090.317416359332
4809. it was my initiation to war	and the insane symphony war plays; for what had happened on the common	was only terror and flight; but this grinning broken head not	ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had	become	4594.8845328736215
4810. and now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was	a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us	3702.8339593318897
4811. i must state	that the faster things happened the slower they happened; the passage	and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened	then each event is a separate and frozen incident	3858.0312803972097
4812. in my recollection	there was a long interval between the death of the officer and	the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval	the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely	6087.868203109805
4813. yet	it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front	of the british army came into view	2329.5821926049057
4814. it was only hours since	i had last seen them but they had changed and i had changed	2362.9923398965116
4815. in	the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing	blood behind them	1254.3768548728644
4816. no drummers here no pipers and the red coats	were covered with a fine film of dust	2131.3816362327316
4817. they marched with bayonets fixed	and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment	1265.2023808251963
4818. rank after	rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same	and they walked in a sea of dust	3696.9630651182183
4819. committeemen hold your fire!	hold your fire! a voice called and what made it even more	terrible	and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant	only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which	the voice came	4560.019389238625
4820. the front of their column had already passed	us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not	five paces from where we were	4288.815008951007
4821. my cousin simmons carried a musket	but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite	him he rose up behind the wall and fired	3120.3210959817034
4822. one moment there was a man	in the saddle; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through	the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of	us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers	6560.044211282491
4823. one moment	the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four	with a purpose as implacable as death; the next a cloud of gun smoke	covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers	emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury	4761.388214024614
4824. in the course	of this they had fired on us; but i have no memory of that	2103.5553012683527
4825. i	had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had	fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule;	and then i was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling	more vile language than i ever thought i knew sobbing and shouting	and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough	for my pants were soaking wet	0.20124717349522497
4826. i would have stood there and died	there if left to myself but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his	viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and then i came	to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i	outdistanced cousin simmons by far	7393.62096357322
4827. later	we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall	790.232628310552
4828. their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching	1412.0994743483168
4829. we tumbled to a stop in deacon gordon's cow hole a low-lying	bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle	2457.49509468735
4830. a dozen	cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps	we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter	the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the	thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the	muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it	8457.327482499091
4831. isaac pitt one of the	men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly; and though	he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on	the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow	4715.896834128332
4832. it may appear that we were cruel and callous but no one had time	to spend sympathizing with poor isaac- except the reverend	3473.672940224204
4833. i know	that i myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn	open by a british musket ball as isaac had been yet i also felt	relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself	4460.729061201995
4834. i was drunk	with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from	the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting	to know what to do next	5636.156195595784
4835. meanwhile i reloaded my gun as the	other men were doing	503.9309469105586
4836. we were less than a quarter of a mile from the	road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and	dust that hung over it	4858.248698561645
4837. wherever you looked you saw committeemen	running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some	parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least	fifty militia were making their way in our direction	4469.493159130239
4838. cousin	joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington	and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving british column but	another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this	section of road	6181.353521185289
4839. i didn't offer any advice but i certainly did not	want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out	2454.581865576625
4840. someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it	the british would be gone; but cousin simmons said he had watched	them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker	pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with	the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts	8487.198553902006
4841. while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west	of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three	men as they approached the road	3334.3479076115896
4842. it was the opinion of some of us that	these must be part of the committeemen who had been in the battle	of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status	and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough	the best one	7476.012380328629
4843. mattathias dover said:   it makes sense	43.56402315684751
4844. if	we cluster together the redcoats can make an advantage out of it	but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of	us except chase us and we can outrun them	5770.977892053326
4845. that settled it	and we broke into parties of two and three	641.742927681706
4846. cousin joshua dover	decided	to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life passed away-	and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world	5149.017795494243
4847. i went off with cousin simmons who maintained that if he didn't	see to me he didn't know who would	1877.1970469351702
4848. good heavens adam	he said i thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning	is when to get out of a place	3260.1857224982928
4849. i learned that now	i said	43.512988970438286
4850. we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back	to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat	3503.103403377578
4851. there	was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road	and the shouting and gunfire never slackened	2327.6792979291313
4852. under the trees	there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and	a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the	eyes	5186.363852437205
4853. three men were around him	14.942531828686265
4854. they had stripped him of his musket	and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off	2588.152013098793
4855. cousin simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away	793.7239128347603
4856. god's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight	going on! cousin simmons roared	2124.6984199110757
4857. they tried to outface	him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would	have taken braver men than these were to outface him	2984.0686667352525
4858. that summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats	of pierre ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer	1888.9168294629512
4859. dancing was no longer	permitted in the streets	166.87744943492254
4860. the bordel and other places of prostitution	were emptied	388.5289436919462
4861. the slit breeches had to go	43.90667896425704
4862. drunkenness was no	longer tolerated	22.159909992419365
4863. in defiance a chinless reprobate jake camaret	marched down the aisle in st peter's one sunday morning followed	by one of the women from the bordel whose dress and walk plainly	showed the lack of any shame	3959.435645684881
4864. plunking themselves down on the front	bench they turned to smirk at those around them	1646.0848928336
4865. john's first	impulse was to denounce their blasphemy	166.40300858081983
4866. but the thought occurred	that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him	1880.1403918078922
4867. calmly	he opened the bible and read of the woman at the well	790.8149396171643
4868. he finished	the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor	god and man	2370.611544406354
4869. the next morning as the clock struck nine	he appeared at the council meeting in the town hall and insisted	that the couple would have to be punished if the church was to be respected	3764.7907206391837
4870. i have told you before and i tell you again monsieur	favre said rudely	1410.9722325885818
4871. stick to the preaching of the gospel!	john stiffened in anger	499.3970065018505
4872. that is the answer the ungodly	will always make when the church points its fingers at their sins	2355.1612484225907
4873. i say to you that the church will ever decry evil!   john's	reply was like a declaration of war	1724.6772813388984
4874. monsieur favre sat down	in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting	960.7157925452696
4875. ablard corne	a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose	500.1356224169713
4876. every eye was on him	as he began to speak	563.0825713244475
4877. what master calvin says is true	43.504812275580505
4878. how can we have a good city unless we respect morality	751.1546549913395
4879. abel	poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to	his feet	1096.459252539227
4880. we all know that jake camaret and the woman are brazenly	living together	1188.94797971602
4881. it would be well to show the populace how we deal	with adulterers	789.6175742591876
4882. philibert berthelier the son of the famous	patriot disagreed	391.05761520528966
4883. do not listen to that frenchman	43.394597993807
4884. he is throttling	the liberty my father gave his life to win!   john	was quietly insistent	1865.202280022623
4885. there can be no compromise when souls are	in jeopardy	376.14330997101627
4886. a week later the sentence of the council was	carried out: jake camaret and the woman were marched naked through	the streets past a mocking populace	4096.345912600152
4887. before them stalked the beadle	proclaiming as he went thus the council deals with those who break	its laws- adulterers thieves murderers and lewd persons	2602.05422923284
4888. let	evildoers contemplate their ways and let every man beware!	john's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter	he had just received from his sister mary	4872.59632005085
4889. charles had died two	weeks before in early november without being reconciled to the church	1093.0276925593985
4890. the canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to	let them give him the last rites of the church but he had died still	proclaiming salvation by faith	5330.147993642805
4891. burial had taken place at night in	the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies	could not find his body and have it dug up and burned	3456.7714983691453
4892. the abbot	of st eloi claude de mommor had been a good friend but not	even he thought charles deserved burial in hallowed ground	3684.6466683732374
4893. john	closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's	bedroom where she had knelt to tell the good virgin of her needs	2853.915395797637
4894. the blue-draped virgin was still there but no one knelt before her	now	1174.302009104911
4895. not even varnessa; she too prayed only to god	263.5818202510307
4896. for an	instant john longed for the sound of the bells of noyon-la-sainte	the touch of his mother's hand the lilt of charles's voice in the	square raftered rooms his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons	and the sight of the beloved bishop	6833.982826814155
4897. but he had to follow the light	93.88005932446225
4898. unless god expected a man to believe the holy scriptures why	had he given them to him	2122.510512963569
4899. the white-clad trees stood like	specters in the february night	375.8336116032632
4900. snow buried the streets and covered	the slanting rooftops as john trudged toward st peter's	1654.2751105207044
4901. a carriage	crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom	502.9409653155869
4902. the	sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated	the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment	4664.587908308089
4903. the city had recently given him a small salary but it was not	enough to supply even necessities	1573.3980860786455
4904. as he neared the square a	round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by	1888.5468057857681
4905. john recognized	ablard corne and called out a greeting	261.89806344006024
4906. how grateful he was to such	men! there were several on the council who tried to live like christians	2575.549702239247
4907. despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver	all the time	641.7610997125631
4908. quickening his steps john entered the vast church and	climbed the tower steps to the bells	1900.6643770480655
4909. underneath the big one in the	silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the clemence	two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold	winter air	3463.5660827465645
4910. john leaned upon the stone balustrade	64.61188250911538
4911. he brushed	back his black hair shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it	from blowing in his eyes	1882.3791551238926
4912. below the moon-splashed world rolled away	to insurmountable white peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered	with stars	2599.946681710796
4913. he stood very still his arms at his sides staring up	at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below	2031.1983881769822
4914. how	long my lord	4.426998305697107
4915. how long	0.20041515
4916. i have never asked for an easy task	but i am weary of the strife	1641.8746767358448
4917. sleep was difficult these days	14.888399645950036
4918. severe headaches were frequent	4.413381650745372
4919. loneliness	tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of peter	robert nerien nicholas cop martin bucer and even the compromising	louis du tillet	2733.4975953555945
4920. an occasional traveler from italy brought	news of peter robert who was now distributing his bible among the	waldensian peasants	2825.2831866247707
4921. letters came regularly from nerien nicholas	and martin	167.5656497395838
4922. he had anthony and william to confide in and consult	560.7011667180456
4923. but william continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and	tearing down symbols sacred to the old church	1888.0245224264775
4924. john found it difficult	but he held him in check	558.2854829326982
4925. and anthony was busy most of the time	courting this girl and that	788.1733890390003
4926. his easy good looks made him a favorite	with the ladies	762.687481864097
4927. geneva instead of becoming the city of god	as john had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there	continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished	3681.9078577129862
4928. refugees poured in signing the confession and rules in order to remain	and then disregarding them	1877.0438586848045
4929. dice rolled prostitutes plied their	trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed	946.4086615121308
4930. catholics who were truly christians longed for the simple penance of	days gone by	1406.0831505188305
4931. libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded:	are we going to allow the protestant pope master calvin	to curtail our liberty	2323.893398476005
4932. h why oh why doesn't he stick to preaching	the gospel instead of meddling in civic affairs politics	economics and social issues that are no concern of the church	4644.833846086318
4933. and john's reply was always the same: anything that affects	souls is the concern of the church! we will have righteousness!	tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight	3465.4206349030947
4934. unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much	longer	962.046135864498
4935. monsieur favre's threat would become a reality for he continued	to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of that frenchman	2176.01797976405
4936. the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming	up to the tower interrupted his reverie	2355.5688635065035
4937. faint at first the tapping	grew until it sounded loud against the wind	789.3879251260017
4938. what is he doing here at this hour	251.63058498695653
4939. he started down the	steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early gospelers	in paris	1889.1580550319206
4940. john	0.30041514999999996
4941. is that you	0.20041515
4942. i came to warn	you of a plot!   john stood above him his face ashen	1650.5566255959025
4943. what	now	0.20041515
4944. slowly like a man grown old he took eli's hand and led	him below to the tower study guiding him to a chair beside the little	hearth where a fire still burned	5168.825881716297
4945. monsieur favre just paid me a visit	93.88954365592386
4946. i went to	your rooms and anthony told me you were here	957.0760609472458
4947. two anabaptists caroli	and benoit are to challenge you and william to a debate before	the council	1426.895116529603
4948. it is to be a trap	65.37952600442004
4949. you know the law: if you lose the	debate after accepting a challenge you will be banished!	what will be the subject	2192.0742071818313
4950. you are to be accused	of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal	1393.2381555683273
4951. anger	and fear fused in john	43.30025914286835
4952. ever since the fourth century a controversy	had raged over the person of christ	1424.3344621713916
4953. those who refused to believe	that he was the eternal son of god were termed arianists	1250.3434919370336
4954. peter	caroli had come to geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the	church of rome and had been persecuted in paris for his reformed faith	4458.079436092939
4955. he asked to be appointed a preacher	94.05018390455947
4956. but michael sept had unmasked	him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an anabaptist	afraid to state his faith because he knew john calvin had written	a book against their belief that the soul slept after death	6351.518404677817
4957. so john	had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now caroli	sought revenge	1423.4897698944733
4958. if william agrees we should	insist on a public debate he said at length	1417.4763965528539
4959. there	is more to the conspiracy	43.639727679673896
4960. bern demands that the lord's supper be	administered here as it used to be with unleavened bread	2112.891613449433
4961. furthermore	bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the council	preach only the word of god and stop meddling in politics!	it was always the spirit with christ; matters such as leavened	or unleavened bread are inconsequential	4300.445502360723
4962. geneva must remain a sovereign	state	65.89678043467308
4963. we will not yield to the demands of bern!   the	firelight played over eli's flowing white locks and rugged features	1885.2745019222425
4964. monsieur favre indicated that if i would co-operate after you	and william are banished following the debate i will be given a	place of influence	3928.5990964211123
4965. what was your reply to that	43.35400360317701
4966. that i would rather be banished with two such christians than	be made the chief syndic!	the following morning as	john entered the place molard on his way to visit a sick refugee	he had a premonition of danger	6195.242405448844
4967. then suddenly a group of men and dogs	circled him	375.0426307951266
4968. he wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would	be lost	1636.1094030062222
4969. he stood very still his heart thumping wildly	166.3314947475762
4970. on the outskirts	of the rabble the camaret brothers and gaspard favre shook their	fists	1646.2453500835531
4971. are you going to comply with the demands of bern	372.534942074855
4972. the chinless jake called	4.3992588638512755
4973. arianist! a rowdy with	a big blob of a nose roared	501.6020406617471
4974. heretic!   john lifted	his hand for silence	139.68229607675883
4975. know this: the ministers will not yield to	the demands of bern	636.7113724863947
4976. his voice shook a little	22.2989403352477
4977. for an instant john was stunned	43.65291701066533
4978. when he felt	the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood	1642.4278747536205
4979. before	he could duck another stone struck him	166.5648078336668
4980. let	him be now! pierre ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said	his little pig eyes glaring	1657.743550069959
4981. we have taught him a lesson	43.7817682206017
4982. the crowd moved back and john started dizzily down the hill	759.2632499215349
4983. fists	pummeled him as he staggered forward	94.1090348601094
4984. then he slipped and went	down on his hands and knees in the melting snow	1652.2908562491866
4985. at once a bevy of dogs	was snapping and snarling around him	642.8557209299637
4986. one more horrible than the	rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling	1651.4469071469891
4987. with great	difficulty john clambered to his feet and started to run sweat	pouring down his face	1417.4319806246108
4988. standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital tent	on which the rain now dripped no longer drumming- adam watched his	own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid	across two beef barrels	6188.031319102828
4989. there was of course no real need to rearrange	everything	376.2467698165985
4990. a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or	the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardines or the bitters or	the condensed milk or the stationery or the needles- what could it	mean	5971.303876672331
4991. adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement	that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like	a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall	vendors forever	3864.3213462376916
4992. he knew its meaning	4.441186333131229
4993. he had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful	solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object	worth a pfennig	2740.870348301908
4994. back in bavaria he had seen that gesture and at	that sight his heart had always died within him	2596.3945716232047
4995. on such occasions he	had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever	face it might be	2178.9093266732148
4996. now the face was his own	65.27456383909025
4997. he wondered what	expression as he made that gesture was on his face	786.5838314697228
4998. he wondered if	it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism	1193.0995148049487
4999. but there was no	need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show	concern or stoicism	2029.0554959695637
5000. it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came	753.9382853203608
5001. then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and the suffering	643.8668372480336
5002. what was he expiating	4.431224658536815
5003. or was he now taking the role- the gesture	and the suffering- because it was the only way to affirm his	history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land	3451.9500810662116
5004. he looked out of the tent at the	company street	560.8193353530062
5005. the rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street	377.0749230848539
5006. beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment	low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would	have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs	or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys	of sticks and dried mud	7695.33500869719
5007. the chimney of the hut across from him was	surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out	1571.535753143537
5008. in this heavy air	however that device did not seem to help	952.3130839240015
5009. the smoke from that chimney	rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the	drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof	3231.8003111948888
5010. over the door was a board with large inept lettering: home	sweet home	1182.3616999576495
5011. this was the hut of simms purdew the hero	260.8308385351094
5012. the men were huddled in those lairs	139.70020404106225
5013. adam knew the names of some	43.485034460831756
5014. he	knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering	or hardened sad or gay good or bad	3708.354239246791
5015. when they stood about	his tent chaffing each other exchanging their obscenities cursing command	or weather he had studied their faces	2037.7415369792386
5016. he had had the need to	understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath	the banter the sadness	3260.533500471628
5017. once covertly looking at simms purdew the	only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack	bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had	seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly	he was not seeing the face of that vile creature	5325.654752902041
5018. he was seeing	somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once	have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety	and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles	6065.150938031786
5019. in that	moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying: i	must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die	2726.8050901996226
5020. his	heart suddenly opened to joy	64.71897683317118
5021. he thought that if once only	once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life	and all life would be clear and simple	2741.156985949548
5022. if simms purdew would turn	to him and say: adam you know when i was a boy it was a funny	thing happened	3487.981893776467
5023. lemme tell you now-   if only simms	purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told	1583.3608494467264
5024. it	would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand	1187.8327543970047
5025. now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the	hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there	in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the	air	4096.468166902838
5026. he saw the sign above the door of the hut: home sweet home	1178.3599895570183
5027. he saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street	with an armful of wood	1887.2870382002923
5028. it was pullen james the campmate	of simms purdew	391.5158020292357
5029. he carried the wood carried the water did the	cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt	for his pains	2470.937185042986
5030. adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho	251.04628815375986
5031. it	gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal	377.4873080984738
5032. pullen james humbly	lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut	and was gone from sight	2601.0117978228254
5033. adam stared at the door and remembered	that simms purdew had been awarded the medal of honor for gallantry	at antietam	2024.3529349119076
5034. the street was again empty	22.309212031449217
5035. the drizzle was	slacking off now but the light was grayer	504.9151494191104
5036. with enormous interest	adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the	board directly before him	2827.558914762286
5037. into the emptiness of the street and his	spirit moved a form	647.6648649435508
5038. the form was swathed in an army blanket	much patched fastened at the neck with a cord	2117.9043671144636
5039. from under the shapeless	huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud	786.1729570025879
5040. the feet wore army	shoes in obvious disrepair	249.01359267687084
5041. the head was wrapped in a turban and on	top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho	had been flung	2737.7238875535522
5042. the gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle	392.4521408397912
5043. moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at	the chin	1258.397371771535
5044. the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching	to dislodge the drop clinging there	2600.666176174206
5045. the figure stopped and one	hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose	1264.2887087778076
5046. then	the figure moved on	22.29171432429336
5047. this was one of the irish women who had	built their own huts down near the river	1418.4743677595216
5048. adam recognized	this one	4.463191651544141
5049. he recognized her because she was the one who in	a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached	down her hand to touch his fly	3337.1710725512835
5050. slice o' mutton bhoy	4.43772808512516
5051. she had queried in her soft guttural	94.01979486071453
5052. slice o' mutton	0.30041514999999996
5053. her name was mollie	2.9343172240652056
5054. they called her mollie the mutton and laughed	251.25967136882386
5055. looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again	stopped and again removed one hand from the basket	2034.5581457949647
5056. he could not make	out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose	1626.4857434065511
5057. mollie the	mutton was scratching her nose	93.08767755912855
5058. the words ran crazily in his	head: mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain	2116.3649113972283
5059. then the words fell into a pattern: mollie the mutton	is scratching her nose scratching her nose in the rain	1873.875881753254
5060. mollie the	mutton is scratching her nose in the rain	558.5366180954757
5061. the pattern would not stop	14.772495439703281
5062. it came	again and again	22.265940213841837
5063. he felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition	260.3885737102034
5064. suddenly he thought he might weep	65.11273921018544
5065. what's the matter with	me	14.724810048773673
5066. he demanded out loud	4.439418025573638
5067. he looked wildly around at the now	empty street at the mud at the rain	1105.7196181834804
5068. oh what's the matter with	me	65.01530181325894
5069. he demanded	0.20041515
5070. when he had stored his stock in the great	oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain	tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up	the darkening street	6214.786440402382
5071. he would consign the cash box into the hands of	jed hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents	and the list of items sold	2850.130183730978
5072. then he-   then what	4.4054063640449455
5073. he did	not know	2.962337103120379
5074. his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended	to blot out a valley	1888.4046466441043
5075. far off in the dusk he heard voices	singing muffled but strong	642.2142226674949
5076. in one of the huts a group of men were	huddled together singing	1178.696257322784
5077. he heard	the words: rock of ages cleft for me let me	hide myself in thee! let the water and the blood from thy riven	side h   he thought: i am a jew from	bavaria	3759.9448650502572
5078. he was standing there he thought in virginia	in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another	jew	3250.96523541001
5079. that other jew a young man too had left that greatcoat	behind in a rich house and marched away	1733.0680000960274
5080. he had crossed the river which	now beyond the woods yonder was sliding darkly under the mist	2120.2316327184485
5081. he had plunged into the dark woods beyond	167.95601500740537
5082. what had that man that other young jew felt as he stood in the twilight	and heard other men far away singing together	3469.6500556217243
5083. 	0.20041515
5084. adam	thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the	thousands of huts stretching away into the night	2848.098417437032
5085. he thought of the	men the nameless thousands huddling in them	501.14483463440774
5086. he thought of simms	purdew snoring on his bunk while pullen james crouched by the hearth	skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled	4089.820382944905
5087. he thought	of simms purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield	a	maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail	to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonets about him	4139.19849591774
5088. he thought	of simms purdew rising up fearless in glory	554.4124310378673
5089. he felt the sweetness	of pity flood through him veining his very flesh	790.2217684970135
5090. those men lying	in the huts they did not know	557.4728603737909
5091. they did not know who they were or	know their own worth	640.2285889889953
5092. in the pity for them his loneliness was gone	388.2865076304647
5093. then he thought of aaron blaustein standing in his rich house	saying: god is tired of taking the blame	1729.636041154983
5094. he is going to let	history take the blame for a while	957.7327800108275
5095. he thought of the old	man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier	945.2397221567159
5096. he thought:	only in my heart can i make the world hang together	1181.6153809475209
5097. adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut	373.9572937034697
5098. he saw mose	squatting by the hearth breaking up hardtack into a pan	1184.0815345999822
5099. a pot was	boiling on the coals	94.65235559478116

5105. he asked	0.20041515

5116. had to put my foot on it to hole it down while i cut it up fer	the lob-scuse	2578.2207680626434
5117. he dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into	the boiling pot of lobscouse	783.5676827246248
5118. good ole lob-scuse he mumbled	and stirred the pot	395.23338956797613
5119. he stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder	168.6633861613005
5120. know what ole buckra et tonight	65.05909757866334
5121. he demanded	0.20041515
5122. know what	i had to fix fer ole him	396.348307314246
5123. adam shook his head	2.9697231753747992
5124. she was a child too much a part of her environment too eager to grow	and learn and experience	2586.5382328538844
5125. once they were at easthampton for the summer		78.87381979394213
5126. one soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the	sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts	everything- amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk	5348.48977400005
5127. fritzie was on the couch reading; laura was sitting in an easy chair	about eight feet away	1418.5248944079394
5128. the infant in white terry-cloth bathrobe	her face intense and purposeful had essayed a few wobbly steps toward	her father	2844.9925240348543
5129. y'all wanna walk- walk he said	43.4862937562081
5130. then gently	he shoved her behind toward laura	248.91054533497427
5131. amy walked- making it halfway	across the cottage floor	260.6424985579847
5132. she lost not a second picking herself up	and continuing her pilgrimage to laura	1398.3211555532855
5133. then laura took her gently	and shoved her off again toward fritzie: amy did not laugh- this	was work concentration achievement	2026.1622548818668
5134. in a few minutes she was making	the ten-foot hike unaided; soon she was parading around the house	flaunting her new skill	3264.5155737940904
5135. some liar's logic a wisp of optimism	as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the	window	consoled her for a moment	2595.1515553726967
5136. amy had to be safe had to	come back to them- if only to reap that share of life's experiences	that were her due if only to give her parents another chance to do	better by her	5884.000088902585
5137. through the swathings of terror she jabbed deceit's	sharp point- amy would be reborn a new child with new parents	living under new circumstances	2458.6373242550726
5138. the comfort was short-lived yet she	found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced	images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion	4445.971589875293
5139. gazing at her husband's drugged	body his chest rising and falling in mindless	rhythms she saw the grandeur of his fictional world that lush	garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs	3455.4316968520934
5140. she	admired him	0.30041514999999996
5141. in the darkness she saw him stirring	94.33677361548331
5142. he seemed	to be muttering his voice surprisingly clear	391.6070539074234
5143. y'all should	have	let me take that money out andrus said	497.57911611809516
5144. 'nother minute	i'd have been fine	65.03576078510756
5145. y'all	should have let me do it	93.57628867830239
5146. yes i know fritzie	4.409510262348283
5147. the heat intensified on tuesday	14.883777175617974
5148. southern california gasped	and blinked under an autumn hot spell drier more enervating more	laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer	past	4311.638804191991
5149. it could continue this way hitting 106 and more in the valley	joe mcfeeley knew into october	1416.4228877602964
5150. he and irvin moll were sipping	coffee at the breakfast bar	745.8451560931986
5151. both had been up since 7:00-	irv	on the early-morning watch mcfeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour	relief	1732.9266284162218
5152. the night before they had telephoned the andrus maid	selena masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous	presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused mcfeeley	and confounded moll	5341.464560453994
5153. the latter thanking her for the coffee had	winked and muttered sure 'nuff honey	942.8568707439885
5154. selena was the wrong	woman for these crudities	252.27617905936285
5155. with a hard eye she informed moll: don't	sure 'nuff me officer	640.4729087711997
5156. i'm honey only to my husband	understand	140.4042305864615
5157. sergeant moll understood	0.20041515
5158. the maid was very	black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform	1423.4493654119622
5159. her speech	was barren of southernisms; she was one of eliot sparling's neutralized	minorities adopting the rolling r's and constricted	vowels of los angeles	2464.9173632601764
5160. not seeing her dark intelligent face one	would have gauged the voice as that of a westwood village matron ten	years out of iowa	3698.611043376225
5161. after she had served the detectives coffee and	toast	she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock	market quotations	2328.712352569788
5162. while she was thus engaged mcfeeley questioned	her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she	had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen	of strange cars cruising the neighborhood	5475.571927944991
5163. she answered him precisely	missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports	1094.2122019368767
5164. selena	masters joe realized was her own woman	251.1298685695769
5165. she was the only kind	of negro laura andrus would want around: independent unservile	probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and	doubly efficient	2723.3681574569373
5166. when the parents emerged from the bedroom	a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly	1873.3894422451947
5167. i'm awful sorry	about what's happened selena said	166.09210372743092
5168. maybe today'll be	a good-news day	65.88141863252359
5169. she charged off to the bedrooms	43.64416148074468
5170. moll	took his coffee	into the nursery	141.3183286871752
5171. during the night a phone company technician	had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones	1580.3316744285285
5172. someone	would have to remain in the office continually	393.18527498851824
5173. mcfeeley greeted	the parents then studied his notebook	167.04192112196617
5174. he wanted to take the mother	to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file	2116.2809652313176
5175. andrus did not answer him	14.797243025906052
5176. his face was	bloated with drugging redder than normal	395.4605058241606
5177. the woman had the glassy	look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all	1420.4161916451155
5178. oh- we managed	she said	22.19027999887045
5179. did anything happen during	the night	43.77068156554258
5180. few crank calls mcfeeley said	22.271025545311858
5181. a	couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising	261.2815460743544
5182. we can	expect more of the same	140.97855617226836
5183. too bad your number is in the directory	166.41479288461483
5184. didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when i had	it listed andrus muttered	1881.3417302076723
5185. he settled on the sofa with his coffee	warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat	2029.475230235131
5186. the three had little to say to each other	390.0923549934763
5187. the previous night's	horror- the absolute failure overcast with the intrusions of	the press had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness of play-acting	2732.2789188714237
5188. sipping their coffee discussing the weather the day's shopping	fritzie's commitments at the network	they avoided the radio the morning tv news show even	the front page of the santa luisa register resting on the kitchen	bar	5951.30585946499
5189. kidnaper spurns ransom; amy still missing	43.398427596437514
5190. once	andrus walked by it hastily scanned the bold black headline and	the five-column lead of the article	and muttered: we a buncha national celebrities	3911.020618307333
5191. mcfeeley told the parents he would escort them to	police headquarters in a half hour	1100.197881072409
5192. before that he wanted to talk to	the neighbors	392.91192045648506
5193. he did not want to bring the andruses to the station	house too early- rheinholdt had summoned a press conference and he	didn't want them subjected to the reporters again	3223.723391352605
5194. he could think	of nothing else to tell them: no assurances no hopeful hints at great	discoveries that day	2572.2813478599373
5195. when the detective left andrus phoned his	secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute	director for his current project	2729.5569304429805
5196. mrs andrus was talking to	the	maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days	she now worked	3469.4852204740746
5197. outside only a handful of reporters remained	93.11560107146984
5198. the bulk of the press corps was covering rheinholdt's conference	562.6145137831021
5199. in contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only	four cars parked across the street	1574.5850691413139
5200. two men he did not recognize were	sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls	1166.4207199018804
5201. he did not see sparling or	degroot or ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed	him twelve hours ago	2332.636543412983
5202. however the litter remained augmented by	several dozen lunchroom suppers	562.0590335501537
5203. the street cleaner had not yet been	around	166.99396804399169
5204. one of the reporters called to him: anything new	lieutenant	557.4454104831862
5205. and he ignored him skirting the parked cars and	walking up the path to the skopas house	1414.634776378287
5206. when mcfeeley was halfway	to the door the proprietor emerged- a mountainous dark man his	head thick with resiny black hair his eyes like two of the black olives	he imported in boatloads	5329.595856416164
5207. the master	of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone	his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective	2180.7213852883447
5208. inside	as soon as mr skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the	detective's errand his family gathered in a huddle forming a mass	of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of	a baroque fireplace	6565.566506839508
5209. flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they	seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait	1255.1035041260436
5210. it was amazing how	they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in	a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy	in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands;	a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble	staircase;	then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor	8488.089687587253
5211. they answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering	in greek to one another awaiting the word from papa who restlessly	cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac	and burst off to the freeway	3947.6631064351923
5212. no they hadn't seen anyone around;	no they didn't know the andrus family; yes they had read	about the case; yes they had let some reporters use their phone	but they would no longer	5495.611505247373
5213. they offered no opinions volunteered nothing	betrayed no emotions	260.0251413838208
5214. studying them mcfeeley could not help make	comparison with the andrus couple	963.100081675127
5215. the skopas people seemed to him	of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy	1561.7179111266423
5216. he imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined	whose children had no	unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal	3489.17684119134
5217. the equation was	simple:	wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world	was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let	no one in on the secrets	3558.1839791213906
5218. by comparison fritzie and laura andrus	were quivering fledglings	391.41844484416833
5219. they possessed no outer fortifications no	hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from	day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them	2983.547823399418
5220. skopas	expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy	made no move to escort mcfeeley to the door	3045.1444718092393
5221. all four remained	impacted on the sofa until he had left	502.57557311713674
5222. he had spoken to mrs	emerson the previous day	391.014916207955
5223. there remained a family named kahler	owners of a two-story tudor-style house on the south side of the andrus	home	1895.3324804446943
5224. their names had not come up in any discussions with laura	and he had no idea what they would be like	3034.025792337049
5225. mcfeeley noted the immaculate	lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped bright and firm;	each shrub glazed with good health	2027.9124567805316
5226. the door was answered	by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed somewhat clerical	in manner wearing rimless glasses	2576.285388797204
5227. when joe identified himself he	nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room	1107.8348299893337
5228. she had a dried-out quality- a gray lean woman	not unattractive	748.7230551008895
5229. both were dressed rather formally	14.75106963110448
5230. the man wore	a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands	of pearls	3064.6094449271022
5231. funny thing mr kahler said when they	were seated when i heard you ringing i figured it was that guy	down the block hausman	2451.7781449189506
5232. kahler continued:	i fixed his dog the other day and i guess he's sore	so i expected him to come barging in	3280.792898541137
5233. mr kahler went on to explain	how hausman's fox terrier had been making in his flower	beds	1414.8579556311117
5234. the dog refused to be scared off so kahler had purchased some	small firecrackers	1420.8335153109174
5235. he would lay in wait in the garage and when the	terrier came scratching around he'd let fly with a cherry bomb	2185.9527197864636
5236. scared	the hell out of him kahler grinned	249.6232317124387
5237. i hit him in the	ass once	94.02939401166252
5238. both grinned at the detective	22.415083927598452
5239. finally all i needed	was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker	and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life	2983.7563322091555
5240. in the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room	and then they went across the hall to the kitchen	3264.448488615743
5241. she was intimidated	by the stove	43.3330083529802
5242. he found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners	for her	1416.8682110942655
5243. the gas flamed up two inches high	93.83140712233914
5244. they found the teakettle	and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox	1883.190761952184
5245. several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny	cake of ice	1095.1840094409476
5246. in their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast	china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door	in the kitchen and pantry	4454.117627668099
5247. while she was settling the teacart he went	back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases	and took out powdered coffee and sugar	2861.418806613104
5248. she appeared with the teacart	and he opened the windows	565.5898062708819
5249. do you want to call eugene	43.283233708184966
5250. he didn't but it was not really a question and so he	left the room walked down the hall to the front of the apartment hesitated	and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study	5942.257748027418
5251. le petit dejeuner harold said in	an accent that did credit to miss sloan his high-school french teacher	1565.3088244120834
5252. at the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their	being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving	and dependable in everybody	3912.5036007236404
5253. since ordinary breakfast-table	conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were	able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the	plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher	of hot milk to them handle first	4733.176084069114
5254. eugene put a spoonful of powdered	coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water	2121.6500835841075
5255. stirring he	said: i am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with	you today	1416.6926265924042
5256. they assured him that they did not expect or	need to be entertained	1170.5609182756034
5257. harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee	in	his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back	in his chair	2591.260929460392
5258. every time he moved or said something	the chair creaked again	757.1961965073431
5259. eugene was not entirely silent	or openly rude- unless asking harold to move to another chair and	placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act	of rudeness	3329.7750433875394
5260. it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight	and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself	back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it	5764.07853024214
5261. through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels	a tired horse's plodding step voices	1577.6136382881855
5262. harold indicated the	photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was	in	1888.9043647128874
5263. eugene told him and he promptly forgot	93.79410321915495
5264. they passed the marmalade	the bread the black-market butter back and forth	964.8491573284343
5265. nothing was said	about hotels or train journeys	166.44676837532097
5266. eugene offered harold his	car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted	the armchair creaked	3474.87647800067
5267. they all three had another cup of coffee	165.53519764549554
5268. eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he	wore yellow turkish slippers that turned up at the toes	3691.4953326912896
5269. ex-cuse	me he said in berlitz english and got up and left them	to bathe and dress	1408.5543149244627
5270. the first shrill ring of the telephone brought	harold out into the hall	1182.6450709871283
5271. he realized that he had no idea where	the telephone was	504.13285927487016
5272. at that moment the bathroom door flew open and	eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down	the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went	5349.112736518092
5273. the telephone	was in the study but the ringing came from the hall	796.2445965688805
5274. between the telephone	and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the	conversation came to an end eugene carried the instrument with him the	whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three	more times while he was shaving and in the tub	7421.856148653829
5275. before he left the apartment	he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could	do for them	2035.9814303090861
5276. sabine called a few	minutes ago eugene said	249.73027779433346
5277. she wants you and barbara to have	dinner with her tomorrow night	637.841187898565
5278. he handed harold a key to	the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while	they were out of the apartment	3464.6298648315087
5279. when enough time had elapsed so	that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had	forgotten harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one	room after another	3565.7785242553014
5280. in the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of	mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf	2578.9482708038568
5281. it was the	most important-looking cradle he had ever seen	375.0145740932279
5282. then came their bathroom	and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls	must belong to mme cestre	3054.0248194688447
5283. a young woman who looked like alix	with her two children	500.5035282006439
5284. alix and eugene on their wedding day	141.31005095786597
5285. matching	photographs in oval frames of mme bonenfant and an elderly man	who must be alix's grandfather	1405.5331383944656
5286. mme vienot considerably younger	and very different	141.64586720990792
5287. and a gray-haired man whose	glance- direct lifelike and mildly accusing- was contradicted by	the gilt and black frame	1730.7112298116153
5288. it was the kind of frame that is only put	around the photograph of a dead person	2127.324660723956
5289. professor cestre could it	be	14.725825229160355
5290. with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark	that it seemed still night in there	2350.754291539405
5291. one of the drawing-room shutters	was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which	seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet	2980.741252015122
5292. the curtains	were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings- portraits	in the style of lancret and boucher	3263.176658327088
5293. though taken	individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment	as a whole formed a triangle	1893.1787269174074
5294. the apex the study where eugene slept	was light and bright and airy and cheerful	1655.7015580139432
5295. the window looked out	on the place redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that	did	1569.9768239382188
5296. looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low	bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass	panes in the doors	4092.9595697713353
5297. the daybed eugene had slept in made up now with	its dark-brown velours cover and pillows	1257.0281171748736
5298. the portable record player	with a pile of classical records beside it	961.1107433666408
5299. beethoven's fifth was	the one on top	94.40431825868305
5300. da-da-da-dum h music could not be eugene's passion	249.68714188424082
5301. besides the records were dusty	14.657298487948424
5302. he tried the doors of the bookcase	141.62846653139553
5303. the titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed	wires: works on theology astral physics history biology political	science	1725.1718161413773
5304. he moved over to the desk and	stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything	2349.799122824494
5305. the clock	on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced	at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room	2733.229248983608
5306. the concierge called out to them as they were passing through	the foyer	1169.5816077177944
5307. her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and	her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big round	oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters	inserted between the mirror and its frame	4638.780581705052
5308. the suitcases had come	while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said	2352.296409233707
5309. he waited until they were inside the elevator and then said:	now what do we do	1255.4210434100612
5310. call the vouillemont i	guess	22.197759914603242
5311. rather than sit around waiting	for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing	1095.6225624400936
5312. they	went to the flea market expecting to find the treasures of europe	and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in	tours	4271.337564689128
5313. cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could	see	949.1641785859181
5314. looked at everything	0.30041514999999996
5315. barbara bought	some cotton aprons and harold bought shoestrings	263.580682515794
5316. they had lunch	at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy	unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the metro;	it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should	have changed in order to take the line that went to the place redoute	7769.049277334333
5317. it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of	his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole	2324.475270438145
5318. when he opened the door	there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment	1638.0901619459642
5319. he was wearing	sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried	a little black bag	1880.4281723742927
5320. he did not explain where he was going and	they did not ask	1176.341354628969
5321. instead they went on down the hall to their room	376.9856736743508
5322. do you think he could be having an affair	395.54912919116225
5323. barbara asked	as they heard the front door close	260.968266428744
5324. oh no harold	said shocked	22.23215812806267
5325. well this is france after all	43.398309982418745
5326. i know but there must be some other explanation	391.9211632116277
5327. he's probably	spending the evening with friends	94.46342929051018
5328. and for that he needs	a little bag	251.0881539405309
5329. they went shopping in the neighborhood	and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given	in blois and some cheese and a dozen eggs and a bag of oranges	from a peddler in the place redoute- the first oranges they had	seen since they landed	4977.153022843665
5330. they had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe	391.7560008850653
5331. when they got home harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment	and thought how under different circumstances they might have	stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that	reminded him of the irelands' apartment in the east eighties	4294.693368272705
5332. they	could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days	751.8858748700083
5333. he	went down the hall to eugene's bathroom to turn on the hot-water	heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming	trunks	3238.829808664863
5334. they were damp	0.30041514999999996
5335. he reached out and felt the	bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub	1265.5098477871663
5336. he looked	around the room and then called out: come here quick	960.5645765704239
5337. what is it	0.20041515
5338. barbara asked standing in the doorway	65.29980658296527
5339. i've	solved the mystery of the little bag	166.61663601275527
5340. there it is h and there	is what was in it	749.5951114808507
5341. but where do people go swimming in paris	168.05556569541858
5342. that boat in the river maybe	65.40698721588998
5343. what boat	0.20041515
5344. there's	a big boat anchored near the place de la concorde with	a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it	3058.5695371643965
5345. but if he has time	to go swimming he had time to be with us	1099.5658928719624
5346. she looked at	him in surprise	65.07474825424642
5347. i know he said reading her mind	93.96907901114226
5348. i don't know what i'm going to do with you	561.0802340522425
5349. it's	because we are in france he said and know so few people	786.8514327164266
5350. so something like this matters more than it would at home	752.1811623983372
5351. also	he was so nice when he was nice	263.2453520384896
5352. all because i didn't	feel like dancing	141.18788053267627
5353. i don't think it was that really	92.95850865341603
5354. then what was it	4.39894529706599
5355. i don't know	0.20041515
5356. the tweed coat maybe	4.452103779658653
5357. the thing about eugene is that	he's very proud	262.89001221436797
5358. and the thing about hurt feelings the	wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite	the innocent party he believes himself to be	4816.127100588534
5359. for instance- what	about all those people harold rhodes went toward unhesitatingly	as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one	chance of knowing each other	3323.286753689486
5360. fortunately the embarrassing	questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would	all have to go sleep in the open fields	3901.961236654605
5361. and in any case answers may	clarify but they do not change anything	783.5281491821489
5362. h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred	pounds' weight	2127.498990623778
5363. they took jesus's body then and wrapped it	in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the jews prepare a	body for burial	2324.2623701963444
5364. listed as present at the descent were mary	mary's sister mary magdalene john joseph of arimathea nicodemus	2131.332652847489
5365. search as he might he could find no place where the bible	spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus	2473.0575752522504
5366. mostly	the scene was crowded with mourners such as the dramatic dell'arca	lamentation in bologna where the grief-stricken spectators had	usurped mary's last poignant moment	3899.7474859991407
5367. in his concept there could	be no one else present	374.6309205117772
5368. his first desire was to create a	mother and son alone in the universe	1415.3802114852076
5369. when might mary have had that	moment to hold her child on her lap	934.778932146434
5370. perhaps after the soldiers had	laid him on the ground while joseph of arimathea was at pontius pilate's	asking for christ's body nicodemus was gathering his mixture	of myrrh and aloes and the others had gone home to mourn	6186.068842932015
5371. those	who saw his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses	945.1249915436023
5372. they would feel what mary was undergoing	141.01806419229672
5373. there would be no	halos no angels	93.50115035279933
5374. these would be two human beings whom god had chosen	563.8668163971131
5375. he felt close to mary having spent so long concentrating	on the beginning of her journey	1250.797807541005
5376. now she was intensely alive anguished;	her son was dead	560.5506016567022
5377. even though he would later be resurrected	he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting	what he had gone through on the cross	2983.2119140416426
5378. in his sculpture therefore	it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt	for his mother; only what mary felt for her son	4447.675455157385
5379. jesus' inert	body would be passive his eyes closed	262.72576057370213
5380. mary would have to carry the	human communication	251.01603022273292
5381. this seemed right to him	14.82386879315662
5382. it was a relief	to shift in his mind to technical problems	966.9872713058119
5383. since his christ was	to be life size how was mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship	seeming ungainly	2168.0864964725197
5384. his mary would be slender of limb and	delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely	and convincingly as she would a child	4275.914143417248
5385. there was only one	way to accomplish this: by design by drawing diagrams and sketches	in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas	to carry his concept	3437.1902740605774
5386. he started by making free sketches to loosen	up his thinking so that images would appear on paper	2366.397880251671
5387. visually	these approximated what he was feeling within himself	260.9417471133321
5388. at the same time	he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping	at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked	like how they moved	4990.51295756418
5389. in particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced	nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads	remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them	down on paper	3547.3395521351135
5390. discovering that draperies could be designed	to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds	2593.0290576321063
5391. he improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure	then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the	lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that argiento	brought from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick	mud	4913.538501075536
5392. no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery had to serve	organically to cover the madonna's slender legs and feet so that	they would give substantive support to christ's body to intensify	her inner turmoil	5926.226042920643
5393. when the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what	adjustments had to be made	947.4010042593975
5394. so that's sculpture commented	argiento wryly when he had sluiced down the floor for a week making	mud pies	2616.450675074074
5395. see argiento	if you control the way these folds are bunched like this or made to	flow you can enrich the body attitudes	2340.5646682475626
5396. they can have as much tactile	appeal as flesh and bone	758.6550351874542
5397. he went into the jewish quarter	wanting to draw hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding	of how christ might have looked	2593.476233291996
5398. the jewish section was	in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa	2124.9487565420777
5399. the colony had been small until the spanish inquisition of 1492	drove many jews into rome	1256.8267486702327
5400. here for the most part they were well	treated as a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity;	many of their gifted members were prominent in the vatican	as physicians musicians bankers	5296.865211481001
5401. the men did not object to	his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could	be persuaded to come to his studio to pose	2975.6703524165277
5402. he was told to ask for	rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon	1401.1250165456354
5403. michelangelo found	the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard	and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on	his head	3350.224757775965
5404. he was reading from the talmud with a group of men from his	congregation	1417.492681030227
5405. when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi	melzi replied gravely:   the bible forbids us to bow down	to or to make graven images	2456.7341880995455
5406. that is why our creative people give their	time to literature not to painting or sculpture	1887.423795649535
5407. but	rabbi melzi you don't object to others creating works of art	641.8026760699099
5408. not at all	0.30041514999999996
5409. each religion has its own tenets	43.79201052982313
5410. i am carving a pieta from white carrara marble	395.5912911540951
5411. i wish to make	jesus an authentic jew	166.48535152085503
5412. i cannot accomplish this if you will not	help me	561.4539880910704
5413. the rabbi said thoughtfully i would not want	my people to get in trouble with the church	1409.6482918942845
5414. i am working	for the cardinal of san dionigi	389.21589340366114
5415. i'm sure he would approve	14.869490069022214
5416. what kind of models would you prefer	141.68117676938752
5417. workmen	0.20041515
5418. not bulky laborers but sinewy men	65.17903061701955
5419. rabbi melzi smiled at	him with infinitely old but merry eyes	504.9966180411225
5420. i will send you the best the quarter has to offer	760.1348006197046
5421. michelangelo	hurried to sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches	asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the	seated madonna	2322.1039692900767
5422. sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle	couch	395.39843270920943
5423. michelangelo bought some scrap lumber	14.899610428101397
5424. together he and argiento	built the stand covering it with blankets	749.6260380611159
5425. his first	model arrived at dusk	43.48745412815026
5426. he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked	him to disrobe so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to	wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes	5472.916860748166
5427. he then draped him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed	to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap	2593.287593171356
5428. the	model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy; only the instructions	from his rabbi kept him from bolting	2140.9454195293347
5429. but at the end of the sitting	when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the	mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo	was after and promised to speak to his friends h	4053.8674870150157
5430. he worked for	two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi	1418.4669739360613
5431. mary presented	quite a different problem	43.718850997519986
5432. though this sculpture must take place	thirty-three	years after her moment of decision he could not conceive	of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and	face by labor or worry	5762.765888635108
5433. his image of the virgin had always been that	of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother	2045.4735496329772
5434. jacopo	galli introduced him into several roman homes	252.24654101749735
5435. here he sketched	sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet	twenty some about to be married some married a year or two	2997.111609926803
5436. since	the santo spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience	in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of	tuscany in their fields and homes	5343.825761976004
5437. he was able to discern the body	lines of the roman women under their robes	1100.2368033628727
5438. he spent concentrated	weeks putting his two figures together: a mary who would be young	and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and	a jesus who though lean was strong even in death h a look he remembered	well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito	7789.247368892114
5439. he drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory	without need to consult his sketches	1414.1787237492688
5440. soon he was ready	to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay	964.5673667798828
5441. here he would have free	expression because the material could be moved to distort forms	1100.7781701458384
5442. when	he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted	clay	1417.3875252905343
5443. next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of	wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence	1717.4757581510707
5444. he respected each	of these approach techniques and kept them in character: his quill	drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture; the clay he used	plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining	torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an	elastic pull	7657.649332075208
5445. yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his	mind; they remained rough starting points	1417.616663520712
5446. when carving he was charged	with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay	and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model	4672.220312305581
5447. the true surge had to be inside the marble itself	373.29033202390576
5448. drawing and	models were his thinking	64.85273977777584
5449. the arrangement	with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo	could not figure who was master and who apprentice	1874.3899741281869
5450. argiento had	been trained so rigorously by the jesuits that michelangelo was unable	to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors whether	they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry	every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal	7333.269003742324
5451. argiento this is senseless he complained not liking to work	on the wet floors particularly in cold weather	1573.0482467617478
5452. scrub the studio once a week	65.66538068193685
5453. before dawn	0.20041515
5454. and god help anyone who tries to unteach you!	grumbled michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble	about for argiento made few demands on him	4476.59875902981
5455. the boy was becoming acquainted	with the contadini families that brought produce into rome	945.8056539509492
5456. on sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with	them and in particular to see their horses	2832.0693633945143
5457. the one thing he missed	from his farm in the po valley was the animals; frequently he would	take his leave of michelangelo by announcing:   today	i go see the horses	3358.2588418831356
5458. it took a piece of bad luck to show	michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him	2115.870754199795
5459. he was crouched over his	anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter	of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil	3097.038899791878
5460. he stumbled	into the house eyes burning like fire	392.7648102719945
5461. argiento made him lie	down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen	cloth and applied it to extract the splinter	2863.0494246650533
5462. though the pain was	considerable michelangelo was not too concerned	561.2162151743927
5463. he assumed he could	blink the splinter out	167.70335617358924
5464. but it would not come	22.174670475993317
5465. argiento never left	his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout	the night	1108.9417356237664
5466. by the second day michelangelo began to worry;	and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing	out of the afflicted eye	4664.092054351549
5467. at dawn argiento went to jacopo galli	93.25841312714165

5472. beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps	952.5104203988394
5473. the thin legs twitched convulsively once then kate felt the little	body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound	2027.010457312493
5474. the scant	flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands	391.6206961898091
5475. when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still	crooning in disbelief no no oh no!   they put	kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian	minister	3537.49640843069
5476. he sat beside kate's bed with the others throughout the	morning talking talking of god's will while kate lay staring angrily	at him	3481.2543824362083
5477. when he told her god had called the child to him she	rejected his words rebelliously	1261.8209477711368
5478. few of the neighbors came but	mrs tussle came called by tragedy	963.0733413509595

5485. god would not do that	kate thought stubbornly	165.98695288119296
5486. jonathan's letter came as she knew	it would and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment	from god against both kate and himself	3915.7140876198296
5487. in blind panic of grief	she accepted jonathan's dictum and believed in her desperation that	she had been cursed by god	2028.6684344424325
5488. she held jonathan's letter his words	burning like a brand and knew suddenly that the bonds between them	were severed	2807.500420295487
5489. she had nothing left but her duty to his land and his	son	786.2435510851615

5677. but it did not matter	14.834472501791433

5703. and all this too shall pass	away: it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church	service when he was a boy- yes in a white church with a thin spur	steeple in the patriarchal hudson valley where a feeling of plenitude	was normal in those english-dutch manors with their well-fed squires	5381.051757736956

5715. all of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified	ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for	his own approaches	2727.7413430334136
5716. when alexander brandel rose to speak the hall	became silent	561.8458610034253
5717. i do not care if your beliefs take you along	a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism	2475.8213995504384
5718. we are	here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest	seeking human dignity	2362.7102389832758
5719. beyond the forest all our paths merge into	a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of judea	2046.2724990866714
5720. this is our singular goal	22.308677486493146

5722. where we end our journey is always the same	392.390764892604
5723. we all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this	long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses	which will continue to plague us until the star of david flies over	zion	4033.594662729425
5724. this was how alexander brandel expressed pure zionism	253.52093188069088

5729. warsaw is my city not tel aviv	93.67414434313142

5731. warsaw! he	saw the smug eyes of the home army chief roman and all the	romans and	the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him	2990.8408767790015

5908. there was somebody else in the apartment	140.6870471577542
5909. honest i could feel the hair stand up on the	back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight	2606.716681734679
5910. i	turned around with the percolator in my hand	391.0786414712161
5911. my eyes were so bleary	i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced	guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora	2983.5035394528886
5912. oval face without an expression in the world	251.9715905229089

5920. instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard	i found myself having a fellowfeeling for him	1882.6449998185103
5921. maybe he felt the	same way	43.45154226247728
5922. i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life	560.9138943461031
5923. first thing	i knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and i was	handing eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a	queen among her courtiers	3444.238244543244
5924. i couldn't face thelma after that	night	141.87329407339587
5925. i didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone	640.2814383901945
5926. i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved	too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express	4272.238664208164
5927. of	course i had to give her eileen's address but she never came near	us	1096.4158955600674
5928. all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was	beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and	it was goodbye forever	4966.50307547561
5929. she never said a word about the fifty dollars	264.18251045846097

5931. i	must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times	635.5186091847391
5932. afterwards i learned that eileen had called thelma on the telephone	and made a big scene about thelma trying to take her husband	away	3696.1784817004736
5933. that finished me with thelma	14.899812336427868
5934. trust eileen to squeeze all the	drama out of a situation	748.028631905145
5935. and there i was shacked up with eileen	in that filthy fourth floor attic on hudson street	1413.257427694009
5936. i use the	phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about	our relationship	1403.762518727914
5937. i felt it and it ate on me all the time but i	didn't know how right i was till later	2016.7082912968563
5938. what i did know was	that precious was always around	558.6445888737278
5939. he slept in the hall bedroom at the	head of the stairs	643.7078060838846
5940. who do you think pays the rent	141.91961379376534
5941. you wouldn't	have me throw the poor boy out on the street eileen said when	i needled her about it	1876.0219587372424
5942. i said sure that was what i wanted her	to do but she paid no attention	1874.708106480839
5943. eileen had a wonderful way of not listening	to things she didn't want to hear	1089.2897471194033
5944. still i didn't think	she was twotiming me with precious right then	958.3833697060005
5945. to be on the safe side	i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night	1575.2375005513911
5946. i couldn't make out what his racket was	247.44278641887195
5947. i'd	thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be	786.2355391645337
5948. he was smooth	and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under	his selfeffacing manner	2570.8468865798573
5949. still he let eileen treat him like a valet	264.47433785728236
5950. whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious	who did the work	1876.6829339618052
5951. i never could find out what his business was	259.41557560971785
5952. he always seemed to have money in his pocket	390.52885656166563
5953. the phone had been	disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger	1098.2958023209571
5954. now and then he would disappear for several days	392.0749839791752
5955. connections	was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading	questions	1256.9225915221007
5956. oh he's just an international spy eileen would	shout with her screechy laugh	1188.5186417400853
5957. poor devil he can't have been	too happy either	262.1540153054733
5958. he got no relief from drink because though sometimes	precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the	evening he'd leave it on the table untouched	4993.758471212155
5959. when i was in	liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess	639.2628331343725
5960. occasionally if i pushed	him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel	bony skull would show through that smooth face of his	4812.388784455905
5961. some day	i told eileen that guy will kill us both	500.52244060799677
5962. getting drunk every night was the only way i	could handle the situation	1188.992241063123
5963. eileen seemed to feel the same way	94.02244790478807
5964. we still	had that much in common	138.7150639676733
5965. the trouble was drinking cost money	43.44479471441453
5966. the	way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars	an evening	2122.779517424703
5967. eileen must have wheedled a little out of precious	259.40975702817934
5968. i raised some kale by hocking the good clothes i had left over from	my respectable uptown life but when that was gone i didn't have a	cent	4471.300521098348
5969. i don't know what we would have done if pat o'dwyer hadn't	come to town	1097.3283070439286
5970. pat o'dwyer looked like a heavier jim	141.9879347746467
5971. he had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have	jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm	2344.419504739745
5972. he was a big	thick beefy violent man	250.0817274064898
5973. now pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly	but he was a good churchgoing catholic and he loved his little	sister	2333.715778393661
5974. those o'dwyers had that irish clannishness that made them	stick	together in spite of politics and everything	2108.56218929547
5975. pat took eileen	and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears	in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again	3205.166498597699
5976. whom god	hath joined etcetera	22.2996915050527
5977. the o'dwyers were real religious people	except for kate	260.66672847719394
5978. now it would be up to me to keep the little girl	out of mischief	1633.1666614966257
5979. pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost	her job on that fashion magazine	1251.6302220856737
5980. it had gone big with the hollywood	girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and apparel	3037.582118879004
5981. how about me trying to help her get her job back	497.5510723757552
5982. all	evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready	for her first communion	2128.0847802558987
5983. it just about blew us both out of the water	when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with	2015.3546904071852
5984. but brother	i can't take a job right now she said with her eyes on her	ice cream i'm going to have a baby francis xavier's baby	my own husband's baby	4989.25960953509
5985. my first thought was how had it	happened so soon but i counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd	been living together six weeks	2713.0920104733577
5986. pat meanwhile was bubbling over with	sentiment	140.90430027059512
5987. greatest thing that ever happened	14.695609014558576
5988. now eileen really	would have to settle down to love honor and obey and she'd have to	quit drinking	2592.3315543682697
5989. he'd come east for the christening by god he would	376.9366935704525
5990. when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill	into eileen's hand to help towards a layette	2584.5180744353615
5991. before he left	town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job	1250.7772042100562
5992. pat had contacts	all over the labor movement	250.01123020074138
5993. a friend of pat's named frank sposato	had just muscled into the portwatchers' union	947.7739060935103
5994. the portwatchers	were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats	and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves	2806.3085521897347
5995. most of them were	elderly men	43.15716367405136
5996. it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because	the thieving is awful in the port of new york	2360.668332726881
5997. they weren't as	well paid as they should have been	374.95788393258096
5998. one reason the portwatchers let	sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen	2099.254824898372
5999. sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to	act as business agent of the redhook local	1888.4599325925392
6000. there i was a retired	wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow	worker in my thirty years in the movement	4109.193071976608
6001. for once radicalism was	a recommendation	43.687297862198115
6002. sposato couldn't wait to get me hired	138.6571431177153
6003. with my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance i certainly looked	the honest working stiff	1107.4496126982335
6004. the things a man will do for a woman	394.47229523464483
6005. there was one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which	he could not deny	1255.919894584514
6006. as long as there were two human beings working together	on the same project there would be competition and you could no	more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave	5318.428129176289
6007. no matter	how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord	he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition	as an individual	3650.1636002699843
6008. all of the jobs in the mission might be equal	in the eyes of the lord but they were certainly not equal in the	eyes of the lord's servants	4646.657839398878
6009. it was only natural that fletcher would	strive for a position in which he could make the decisions	1573.5421930682528
6010. even rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he	knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church-	his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career-	but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel	7547.047422385415
6011. he	was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church	and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two	were intertwined and could not be separated	4027.9680167042047
6012. he wanted desperately	to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out	the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he	himself would be triumphant too	5006.329597916186
6013. but perhaps this was a part of the	eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with god would be a driving	indefatigable force for good in the world	2990.5478591184083
6014. how foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith	would suffice	2358.63387194149
6015. he would have to work without questioning the motives	which made him work and content himself with the thought that the	eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed	3449.2221095842897
6016. his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days	1636.358867743143
6017. his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough	of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or	whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print	shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse	4766.349952864311
6018. in any event rector	sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to	keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find	out what kayabashi was planning	6043.387113583023
6019. hino was elated at the prospect	43.32068622025107
6020. he was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital	and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor-	an excellent place to make contact with the enemy	5656.799785048798
6021. he left with all	the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively	as rector gave him his final instructions	2319.5235309248774
6022. he was to get involved in	no	arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen	and report back what he heard	4263.056644499865
6023. it was a ridiculous situation	and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious	would make a poor espionage agent	2023.6910943309806
6024. if he wanted to know anything he	would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner	he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to	get them by indirection	5615.474960785184
6025. in all of his experience in the mission field	rector had never seen a convert quite like hino	1585.602114634833
6026. from the moment	that hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job-	his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise	hand- he had been ready to become a christian	6205.15070100773
6027. he had already been	studying the bible; he knew the fundamentals and after studying	with fletcher for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted	to be baptized and that was that	3548.767426986777
6028. rector had never been able	to find out much about hino's past	954.2525993185387
6029. hino talked very little about	himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration	in connection with another subject	2167.8315178925213
6030. putting the pieces of	this mosaic together rector had the vague outlines of a biography	1641.3514287053792
6031. hino	was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in	chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing	the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment	on a fishing boat	4392.494566216576
6032. without exception hino's brothers turned	to either one or both of their father's occupations but hino showed	a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach	where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller	6605.282427215503
6033. he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer	had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail	regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five	quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if	he belonged here and had become a christian	5534.9951123538285
6034. rector was often curious;	often tempted to ask questions but he never did	1176.8229237458938
6035. if and when hino	decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked	1263.7460570418039
6036. rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village	bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto	liberally embellished with his active imagnation	4652.059505335145
6037. when the telephone	rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had	a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important	to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village	and the phone in rector's office rarely rang unless it was important	5177.012792817445
6038. he was surprised to find kayabashi's secretary on the other	end of the line	1407.1877722462161
6039. he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi	wanted	500.3567627374826
6040. the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the	secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi	wished to show them the mission	4120.8040207804925
6041. they had never seen one before	and had expressed a curiosity about it	797.3720143151605
6042. i guess it will be all right	140.37424727573887
6043. when would the oyabun like	to bring his guests up here	502.90787018528306
6044. this afternoon the	secretary said	22.196816389845253
6045. at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to	you at that time	938.9559777139195
6046. i will	be expecting them	22.152371152545278
6047. he was about to hang up the phone but	a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation	open	2036.3944202420832
6048. he had something more to say	65.37482596611594
6049. i beg to inquire if the back	is now safe for travelers he said	944.0256416548485
6050. unless the oyabun has been working on it he said	then checked himself and added: you can tell kayabashi-san	that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for	his party to use	6049.87806755866
6051. the secretary	sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in rector's	hand	789.6101699033111
6052. rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission	751.9232283698989
6053. for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great	weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all	the available information it was probably the latter	3547.292586746168
6054. kayabashi must	feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this	a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the	village	4838.8000825162635
6055. at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend	a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity	2170.708494668714
6056. no kayabashi	was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector	would not be able to fathom it until they arrived	3464.76751564767
6057. when he had	given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask	mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using	the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been	donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds	5091.31716799484
6058. fujimoto	had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn	962.003371884252
6059. rector asked	him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound	to be effortlessly spotless	1726.7849946968897
6060. a good initial impression would be important	now	249.5417029634385
6061. he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished	cleaning the press	950.4240568720559
6062. how many pamphlets do we have in stock	249.65431587904385
6063. rector said	0.20041515
6064. i should say about a hundred thousand	fletcher said	392.96254912554747
6065. why	0.20041515
6066. i would like to enact	a little tableau this afternoon rector said he explained about	the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy	mission	5021.846530887278
6067. he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display	the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner	1884.868863249091
6068. fletcher	nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange	the things rector requested	2128.0887831550813
6069. rector's next stop was at	the schoolroom where mavis was monitoring a test	788.4697862582625
6070. he beckoned to her	from the door and she slipped quietly outside	959.2186238898319
6071. he told her of the visitors	and then of his plans	499.7740739005485
6072. how many children do you have present	today	252.0710077467896
6073. he said	0.20041515
6074. she looked back toward the schoolroom	65.7389898227418
6075. no only fourteen	0.20041515
6076. the little ito girl	had to go home	253.04480228480935
6077. she has a pretty bad cold	43.557235860568674
6078. i would	like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant	full of life	2350.6952990783834
6079. i want to create the impression of a compound	full of children	639.5622700285405
6080. do you think you can manage it	141.61011950818283
6081. mavis	smiled	0.20041515
6082. as rector was walking back toward	the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and bounded up	to him	2831.378403487262
6083. the altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen	his spirits but he was still a little wary around rector for they	had not yet discussed the incident	3212.499212784761
6084. i think i've fixed the pump	so we won't have to worry about it for a long time he said	2822.370771066759
6085. i've	adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water	gets too low	1256.9524155986835
6086. he looked out over	the expanse of the compound	391.1432990727471
6087. it was going to take a lot of activity	to fill it	635.0386239892704
6088. have you ever operated a transit	65.3344060884563
6089. he said	0.20041515
6090. you are about to become a	first-class surveyor rector said	558.1757185865079
6091. when konishi gets back with	the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boys	1579.74643492124
6092. you'll find an old transit in the basement	251.28546241397999
6093. the	glass is out of it but that won't matter	370.803668018232
6094. it looks pretty efficient	and that's the important thing	395.07508117071495
6095. he went on to explain what he	had in mind	375.37097616972676
6096. he said he could do it	65.58581279332365
6097. rector	was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential	hall	1417.782856930879
6098. it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody	seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not	remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much	5631.102456113939
6099. he was	not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point	when you got right down to it	2315.3109178771647
6100. he was not going to lose the mission	by default and whatever reason kayabashi had for bringing his little	sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise	5325.691541933973
6101. he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make	sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take	charge of the office while the party was here	3531.154102618401
6102. when everything had been	done rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly	report until three o'clock	3032.075636034483
6103. at two thirty he sent fujimoto	to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to	keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed	the approach of kayabashi's party	4236.133455922356
6104. then rector attired in his best	blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a	tree smoking a cigarette and waiting	4477.16208417266
6105. the air was cooler here and the	lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect	which he found pleasant	2608.1495283749114
6106. she concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one	be inconvenient	1417.3632286712293
6107. the fish took the bait	14.936402020721655
6108. he replied that he	could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with	a stranger but- joy of joys he would be at home at the hour mentioned	4991.522440618446
6109. but when she called he had thought better of the matter	and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement	2032.1318993252899
6110. she was told	by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged	on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed	4811.262186084272
6111. claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff	daunt her purpose	938.7605609783407
6112. she wrote again and now abandoning for the moment	the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career	3478.0505645388985
6113. she could act and she could write	94.22784920825181
6114. his lordship was concerned in the	management of drury lane but if there were no opportunities there	would he read and criticize her novel	3678.117800319419
6115. at last he consented	to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a	yet more remarkable proposal:   have you any objection to the	following plan	2987.5991102913126
6116. on thursday evening we may go out of town together	by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles	3473.5263614812525
6117. there	we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning	h   she concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle	with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle	manners and the wild originality of your countenance	4553.764237926677
6118. she opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed! and	he would see her that evening	2124.780617839687
6119. victory at last!   at their	meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend	to that	1723.1947493024213
6120. there was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as	claire	rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left	4287.568959363005
6121. she sang him scott's charming ballad rosabelle which was the	vogue of the moment	937.3704398613133
6122. she had never sung better	22.266320028190563
6123. your voice	is delightful he approved with a warm smile	374.2644946117572
6124. tomorrow will	be a new experience- i have never before made love to a nightingale	h	1895.6913555219253
6125. there have been cooing doves chattering magpies thieving jackdaws	a proud peacock a silly goose and a harpy eagle- whom i was	silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals	3863.10349749116
6126. and so they went he choosing of all places an inn near medmenham	abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the hellfire	club	4104.724660317752
6127. he regaled claire with an account of the mock mass performed	by the cassocked bloods which he had had at firsthand from old	bud dodington one of the leaders of the so-called order	3556.2415373759713
6128. each	wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not	employed for self-flagellation h	2331.0970983508964
6129. naked girls danced in the chancel	of the abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen	to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities	2736.4467301105533
6130. the jaded	amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish	956.0136421946829
6131. alas	all that belonged to the age of devil dashwood and wicked	wilkes abbot and beadsman of the order! the casual seduction	of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison	3221.857315699016
6132. they passed close by the turn to bishopsgate	248.70682129904102
6133. a scant half mile	away shelley and mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace	the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale	who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden	4322.537104114797

6137. to be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd	372.3552141350303
6138. she was the pursuer as clearly as was venus in shakespeare's poem	965.3750887332183
6139. and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might	well be an equal handicap	1257.2331208343865

6155. as they waited for supper they sat by the	fire glasses in hand while byron philosophized as much for his own	entertainment as hers	2455.7858033742195

6166. i don't ask you who 'tis	you're being unfaithful to husband or lover	1175.9623967891223
6167. for a moment she thought of answering with the truth	but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded	some	degree of education in body as well as mind	3533.3836297629578
6168. very well	she said i'll not catechize you	249.8491069054261

6174. he drew her close and hand on	cheek turned her face to his	1176.7531478335081
6175. her lips moist and parted spoke his	name	168.09910561980843
6176. byron!   his hand went to her shoulder and	pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown;	then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous	fingers untied it	5620.76434522364
6177. the bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing	his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to	undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child	3216.8606362539535
6178. but kindled by	his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame	955.3657272618296

6182. it was an excellent vintage	22.28701110058848
6183. he rose and went to the bedroom	93.69541544896379
6184. pausing in the doorway he said:	the form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit	is the most challenging loveliness in all nature	4085.965871598085
6185. when claire	returned to bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become	byron's mistress	1092.511876182824

6187. as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was	as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with	her dramatic tidings	2458.13354712924
6188. although it is not the best of which	he is capable said shelley as he closed the book it is still	poetry of a high order	4109.356555738918
6189. if he would only leave the east	said mary	262.4990113528064

6199. with a pardonable	irony shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his	daughter:   fanny and mrs godwin will probably be glad	to hear that mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement	and that her child is well	4307.498604205596
6200. at the same time another	child- this one of shelley's brain- was given to the world:	alastor a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze	into the still depths of a fine mind's musings	5915.743594073988

6221. on all sides doors were being slammed in his	face	372.8924485212783
6222. the previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only	served to increase his popularity	1644.0420255828606
6223. now under the impact of his wife's	disclosures he was brought suddenly to the realization that there	was a limit to tolerance however brilliant however far-famed the offender	might be	3208.0695519596275

6229. beckworth handed the pass to the colonel	93.75972544113381
6230. he had thought that	the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction	of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently	thrust into the colonel's belt	5785.748947373808
6231. despite his yearning the colonel	would not go down to see the men come through the lines	1424.3503310435085
6232. he would	remain in the tent waiting impatiently occupied by some trivial	task	1180.3513534083556

6243. it	stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank	505.99577740587074
6244. from the outside it	seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth	2138.3970233541168
6245. a crude	ladder ran down to a wooden floor	263.05858819647557

6247. the place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth	rotting wood and urine	638.7857632708667
6248. the plank floor was slimed beneath watson's	boots	251.77287356336373

6250. there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly	from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid	striking his head on the heavy beams	4868.184403337543

6264. he had peered through	the darkness at the rampart	394.3438967467712
6265. the men he would take back across	the river stood there but he turned away from them	1412.2835978802127
6266. he wanted no part	of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude	that other men felt	3036.819550164261
6267. he had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the	soldier had followed him	1100.8067090913994
6268. though watson carefully ignored the man	he could not deny his presence	965.0631867796535
6269. perhaps it would be better to speak	to him since silence could not exorcise his form	1255.9174900550302
6270. watson glanced briefly	at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner	1658.5197743214017
6271. we won't be too long	14.804769281411575

6278. he	paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor	563.497209504978
6279. he tried	to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some	coherent portrait of the dead boy	2047.2674817085433
6280. his lack	of success steadily eroded his interest	250.9446726675636
6281. he stopped pacing leaned	against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drift	949.8227270623099
6282. a feeling of	futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known	seeped through him	2579.875770538661
6283. what in the name of god was he doing crouched	in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river	2046.1890758937436
6284. why had he crossed	the dark water to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or	to skulk in a foul-smelling hole	3267.7174071862373
6285. he grew annoyed and at the	same time surprised at that emotion	637.2328501798672
6286. he was conscious of a growing sense	of absurdity	392.1458431077399

6292. for	what	0.30041514999999996
6293. to tell john something he would find out for himself	372.20432169601526

6295. watson	snorted and then laughed aloud	43.69998717689915
6296. exactly!   the soldier's	voice was muffled again stricken with chagrin	559.637862022376
6297. he clutched the	staff	and his dark eyes blinked apologetically	376.79617626387005
6298. let's get out of here	22.144097742586535
6299. watson ran up the ladder	and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud	and river weeds	2180.657712366538

6303. three	union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready	261.1838271019556
6304. watson stared	at them	curiously	22.163766451966506
6305. they were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with	neat uniforms and sturdy boots	946.5617137697775
6306. behind them shambled a long column of	weak tattered men	558.1317983533208
6307. the thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry	like the call of a bird flock	1255.1420615136117
6308. they moved toward the skiffs with shocking	eagerness elbowing and shoving	756.8293461090791

6313. no one moved to them	14.718351294869048
6314. watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened	to their voices beg shrilly	2113.100398856775
6315. in a confused soaked and stumbling	shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the	same skiff	2037.5906223016414
6316. the third crawling man forced himself erect	140.15523154390092
6317. he swayed	like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles	503.326126938235
6318. he paced forward unsteadily	leaning too far back his head tilted oddly	963.3861121570853

6406. i can see it from this	window where i write	562.5027878824255

6512. it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known	1183.8286213751596
6513. then he	played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons	his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of	the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries	3942.7960384608573
6514. his money	was tied up in a nassau hotel an ohio pottery works and a detergent	for window-washing and luck had been running against him	3916.6844385757586
6515. his	worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went	to the window	1572.6819768191222
6516. in the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their	leaves	964.4743123176004
6517. during the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses	at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel	tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near belmont	and saratoga	4041.6019240281835
6518. maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on	three in the fourth fifty to win on six in the third one hundred	to win on two in the eighth	5153.573536070073
6519. children walking home from school would	scuff through what seemed to be his foliage	936.9631953781766
6520. then getting back into	bed he thought unashamedly of mrs flannagan planning where they	would next meet and what they would do	3264.6423099754784
6521. there are he thought so few	true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the	medicine even when the medicine seemed as it did a little crude	3337.2376188744834
6522. it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been	to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness	their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside	from due notification of certain major events in their lives	christmas and easter cards of the	traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through	the widowed years	0.30166232349522504
6523. her thoughts were not discrete	14.697222302829065
6524. but there was	a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons	1413.1351466076712
6525. she	grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird	alert for flight	1420.2966029740387
6526. she turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the	dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in	an atmosphere of sea spray	3920.246657234363
6527. there she extracted two limp vellum sheets	and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark	1582.8020425478908
6528. once	her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against	the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as	they would dropping from her own lips	5013.791238926759
6529. and the stiffly regal look of	them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts	of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged	string	3557.9772341074577
6530. please come down as soon as you conveniently can	the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen i have an	important matter to discuss with you	4139.25248034549
6531. to abel: i am afraid	there is not much to amuse small children here	937.69011547475
6532. i should be obliged	if you could make other arrangements for your daughters	1191.3807070225732
6533. you may stay	as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the	girls must take time into account i think a day or two should be enough	to finish our business in	4047.1084459694603
6534. to mark: please give my regards	to myra	250.26129022979504
6535. she signed the letters quickly stamped them and	placed them on the hall table for raphael to mail in town	1869.0562264583775
6536. then she	went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the	glare on the water	2599.5591207060133
6537. my nephews will be coming down she	said that evening as angelina brought her dinner into the dining room	the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray	2862.06027652288
6538. she looked at the girl	speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years; from the	early evening lights of them which had first startled izaak to look	at	her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which	had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of	the light of the sea in them	8366.524890665762
6539. angelina placed the tray on the	table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth	1575.5390168183746
6540. she smiled	and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face	961.9891749568453
6541. that	will be so nice for you mrs packard she said	504.61052872381345
6542. her voice was	ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in sicilian brilliance before	the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose	4069.630866700548
6543. um said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray	794.1769336044536
6544. you remember them i suppose	22.09605272575935
6545. she glinted suspiciously at the	dish before her: blowfish	260.46961228360743
6546. i hope raphael bought them whole	65.41427359488466
6547. angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions	374.8983932528649
6548. then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm	755.678736430595
6549. yes	she said i remember that they came here every summer	501.45387564380434
6550. i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me	1180.557056368294
6551. abel	0.20041515
6552. the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips	559.308294157799
6553. for an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through	her smile	790.1056060021559
6554. she would have said triumph	22.099288456250587
6555. then angelina turned and	with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen	649.1311631564909
6556. jessica packard	lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting	nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips	3910.9754741248157
6557. for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway; then she snorted	and groped for her fork	1719.1131093182291
6558. there's no greater catastrophe	in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans	on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family	3884.5419668618174
6559. procreation	expansion proliferation- these are the laws of living things with	the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion	2175.73977558933
6560. when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then	warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed	ah then the true bitterness of	existence could be tasted	5438.188249441587
6561. and indeed the young garden beans were brackish	in her mouth	500.0337267756384
6562. she was the last living of the older generation	393.56119051226506
6563. what had once been a widespread family- at one time she knew	there were enough packards to populate an entire county- had now	narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark	3444.261289331839
6564. she swung her eyes up	to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans	2366.2372368021147
6565. what hope lay in the nephews she asked the intensifying light out there	with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced having	sired two girl children with none to bear on the packard name	3963.25643237995
6566. she ate	0.30041514999999996
6567. it seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom	drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs	giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows	3551.7561054013213
6568. here too	she talked low quirking her head at one or another of the places	most often at izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table	4277.13977925359
6569. or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously	playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early	years	2721.206027985552
6570. she thought again of her children those two who had	died young before the later science which might have saved them could	attach even a label to their separate malignancies	4834.873007905101
6571. the girl her	first she barely remembered	94.57826219456521
6572. it could have been anyone's infant for	it had not survived the bassinet	1174.5159093503712
6573. but the boy h the boy had been	alive yesterday	378.32615423441257
6574. each successive movement in his growing was recorded	on the unreeling film inside her	1402.251313612753
6575. he ran on his plump sticks of	legs	freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the	camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed	and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom	drawer of the escritoire	4850.417723382032
6576. in the cruel clearness of her memory the	boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain	with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable	to her	5304.656414499654
6577. it was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water	on those days when she hated the sea	1727.2458389272463
6578. the brothers drove	down together in mark's small red sports car mark at the wheel	1639.9700233188094
6579. abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading	out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the	silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields	3778.4552642108115
6580. he saw the land with a stranger's eyes all the old familiarness	gone	1187.5206642307219
6581. and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger	impervious complete in itself	1257.2675368004993
6582. there was stability there too- a	color which his life had had once	1187.5767386995851
6583. that is what childhood is he told	himself	166.7544343660582
6584. in the stiff neutral lines of the	telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of aunt jessica's	letter	2593.5927364764693
6585. what bad grace what incredible selfishness he and mark	had shown	501.3161814840558
6586. the boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might	never have been	751.1210666528417
6587. they had closed over absolutely with the sealing	of old izaak's grave	642.4449793454685
6588. the small car flew on relentlessly	64.67195354933999
6589. the old	woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took	on an ominous reality	1414.730270022402
6590. abel moved and adjusted his long legs	140.57141131182306
6591. i suppose it has to do with the property mark had said over	the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters	2468.1585866669243
6592. not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house	and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one	shameful moment of covetousness	4823.566355424392
6593. he and mark were the last of the family	and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no	end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer	3645.53788398316
6594. now abel turned his head to look at his brother	559.6758304059931
6595. mark held	the wheel loosely but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful	way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd	make in the years to come	3657.761822772609
6596. his sandy hair was already beginning	to thin and recede at the sides and abel looked quickly away	2354.055336104747
6597. mark	easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably	categorized	645.0890420195117
6598. the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they	approached the sea	753.2770227585214
6599. she didn't mention bringing myra mark	said maneuvering the car into the next lane	945.772535357463
6600. she's probably	getting old- crotchety i mean- and we figured uh-uh better not	1182.236802696644
6601. they've never met you know	14.97854212998547
6602. but myra wouldn't budge without	an express invitation	249.86101379869282
6603. i feel kind of bad about it	93.51205887507555
6604. he gave abel	a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and	abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt	3892.803173748363
6605. i imagine	the old girl hasn't missed us much mark added his eyes on the	road	1264.4803500322655
6606. abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation	140.3453761985353
6607. it was barely possible that his brother was right	259.06138340538695
6608. he could	tell they were approaching the sea	247.7506982672388
6609. the air took on a special strength	now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind	1572.353547914979
6610. there was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed	of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern air	3265.3795782575244
6611. he turned	from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye	again the great fieldstone house which built on one of the many acres	of ancestral land bordering the west harbor had been izaak's bride-gift	to his cousin-wife as the last century ended	4855.6968113839885
6612. mark's	thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing	the same crags in dirty white sneakers clambering out on top of the	headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant	5902.18972360809
6613. remember the starbird	0.20041515
6614. mark asked and abel lifted his	eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the twin white	ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of	the hill and came down	5953.248454633057
6615. there	was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture	handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that	he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy	wished	4056.6537748812784
6616. the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team	h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth	and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance	could	6057.6497852617185
6617. they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a	mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually	2469.413275340917
6618. he saw the starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently	turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus	sky	3684.8272606338724
6619. both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her	waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails	2589.4922649367686
6620. the starbird	had been long at the bottom of the bay	752.8602193138058
6621. they came unexpectedly	upon the sea	43.383528403527556
6622. meeting it without preparation as they did robbed	of anticipation a common disappointment seized them	1640.4484065420208
6623. they were	climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid	blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into	a faint mist of light and ended	3352.7282937056807
6624. mark stopped the car and switched	off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being	no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an	absence of stars	5792.778935584921
6625. his eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky they'd	glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage	2588.663350120828
6626. i decided	i hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while i was away	where i couldn't watch dying just to entertain hans and making	me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the	covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling	7750.597609711862
6627. oh he'd not care about the pedersen kid	168.33834293185782
6628. he'd not care about getting	waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid	and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain	5185.399731746484
6629. that would make	him mad enough if he was sober	375.90238496926395
6630. i didn't hurry though it was cold	and the pedersen kid was in the kitchen	1644.770575335439
6631. he was all shoveled	up like i thought he'd be	372.4577474317672
6632. i pushed at his shoulder calling	his	name	251.9104830769398
6633. i think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except	to roll a little when i shoved him	1877.3510524248777
6634. the covers slid down his skinny	neck so i saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but	his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose	on the plaster- and i thought well you don't look much like	a pig-drunk bully now	7539.080357660108
6635. i couldn't be sure he was still asleep	166.436936672079
6636. he	was a cagey sonofabitch	22.361240839268497
6637. i shook him a little harder and made some noise	379.05999700735936
6638. i was leaning too far over	65.28477635580512
6639. he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean	to reach him	1104.9532903695517
6640. it put you off	4.440073707101931
6641. i knew better but	i was thinking of the pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough	1249.1287488682988
6642. when his arm came up i ducked away but it caught me on the side of	the neck watering my eyes and i backed off to cough	4294.657745228607
6643. pa was on his	side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist	in the pillow	2173.5620719935146
6644. get the hell out of here	64.65951948150548
6645. i didn't	say anything trying to get my throat clear but i watched him	940.7746993695666
6646. he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear	968.3557113950768
6647. it was better though	he'd hit me	93.27631510797036
6648. he was bitter when he missed	65.37916686451113
6649. get the	hell out of here	43.13613110328771
6650. he told me to wake	you	65.20668073153911
6651. a fat hell on big hans	43.75747126011745
6652. he found the pedersen kid by the crib	250.74035278227961
6653. pa pulled at the covers	14.911263832163721
6654. he was tasting his mouth	22.219990922007117
6655. hans is rubbing him with snow	43.78277368477572
6656. he's got him in the kitchen	65.33870247538174
6657. it's the pedersen kid	2.961508131127295
6658. nothing	to steal from the crib	65.82920003645094
6659. he was just	lying there	14.716401150770078
6660. that's where he was when hans	found him	250.59688952334372
6661. i ain't hid nothing in	the crib	93.98188988748326
6662. the pedersen	kid	0.30041514999999996
6663. the kid-   i god damn well understand	94.02437112956054

6665. i god damn well understand	14.859292314257953
6666. you	know i don't want to see pedersen	248.68114384486194

6668. what	did he come for hey	65.29701133971763
6669. god dammit get	0.20041515
6670. find out something	0.30041514999999996
6671. both you and hans	2.9592674783919906
6672. he was shouting	and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow	1185.3844485407958
6673. he had long	black hairs on his wrist	165.20087554607323
6674. they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt	250.73483055478385
6675. big hans made me come	14.755206512707977
6676. big hans said-   a	fat hell on big hans	396.11281486230286
6677. he's an even bigger fool than you are	167.77863571755375
6678. fat hey	0.30041514999999996
6679. i taught him dammit and i'll teach you	168.70761068208387
6680. you	want me to drop my pot	140.39729632395284
6681. he was about to get up so i got	out slamming the door	786.749452884688
6682. he was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep	753.8831270794317
6683. once he went after hans and dumped his pot	over the banister	647.6017162607529
6684. pa'd been shit-sick in that pot	64.5762750825692
6685. he didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part	of pa's door down before he stopped	1718.5038177055662
6686. he might not have gone that	far if pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house	2570.6259845017494
6687. that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it	940.0406175329703
6688. i	always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their	chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out	4660.281082033527
6689. i	heard pa cursing all the way downstairs	166.77609262909886
6690. hans had laid steaming	towels over the kid's chest and stomach	755.8139048961349
6691. he was rubbing snow on	the kid's legs and feet	376.5849730755428
6692. water from the snow and water from the towels	had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough	was turning pasty sticking to the kid's back and behind	5508.941692454818
6693. ain't	he going to wake up	43.193026600141884

6704. go back to sleep most likely	65.21507016422406

6714. he don't care and i don't care to have his shit	flung on me	1412.1044124090427
6715. he don't care about anybody	14.870526543832948
6716. all he cares about is	his whisky and that dry crack in his face	1416.3257836447394
6717. get pig-drunk- that's	what he wants	43.251707852005445

6719. that cock	0.20041515
6720. i'll get the spirits ma said	65.61477918762526
6721. i'd wound big	hans up tight	43.55252086816948
6722. i was ready to jump but when ma said she'd get the	whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down	3687.073602477683
6723. ma	never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off	786.1950350857315
6724. not for years	0.30041514999999996
6725. the first thing every morning when she washed her face	she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot	cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping	out as it flew	4365.812072908496
6726. it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember	that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while	he was still spattered with pa's yellow sick insides	5468.956565772398
6727. no	you won't big hans said	43.57059358555239
6728. yes hans if they're	needed	ma said	141.2563436450592
6729. hans shook his head but neither of us tried	to stop her	637.7881857160818
6730. if we had then one of us would have had to go instead	1189.3934801712037
6731. hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed	508.29289841922235
6732. i'll	get more snow i said	65.32984629073957
6733. i took the pail and shovel and went	out on the porch	643.313825708925
6734. i don't know where ma went	65.64163447352159
6735. i thought she'd	gone upstairs and expected to hear she had	504.9909040650956
6736. she had surprised hans	like she had surprised me when she said she'd go and then she surprised	him again when she came back so quick like she must have because	when i	came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three	white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat	8279.38605261052
6737. oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the	drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm	2608.4711106276704
6738. he was awful angry because he'd thought ma was going to do something	big something heroic even especially for her h i know him h	i know him h we felt the same sometimes h while ma wasn't thinking	about	that at all not anything like that	7133.859519550062
6739. there was no way of getting	even	93.43443451648452
6740. it wasn't like getting cheated at the fair	249.96819447254506
6741. they were always	trying so you got to expect it	375.24830135858895
6742. now hans had given ma something of	his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa-	something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her	there was no easy way of getting it back	6431.139394505934
6743. hans cut the foil	off finally and unscrewed the cap	377.04035872184465
6744. he was put out too because there	was only one way of understanding what she'd done	1879.6377653230495
6745. ma had found one	of pa's hiding places	167.30245108687987
6746. she'd found one and she hadn't said a	word while big hans and i had hunted and hunted as we always did all	winter every winter since the spring that hans had come and i had	looked in the privy and found the first one	6959.019662811382
6747. pa had a knack for hiding	43.45860230543579
6748. he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it	389.6130859343036
6749. she'd	found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't	know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found	saying nothing	3216.53568670993
6750. pa was sure to find out	64.40491144453979
6751. sometimes he didn't	seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or	because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't	hid one after all or had drunk it up	3957.8071572556028
6752. but he'd find out about this	one because we were using it	957.7450735762616
6753. a fool could see what was going on	166.4156163781256
6754. if	he found out ma found it- that'd be bad	562.4869203359002
6755. he took pride in his	hiding	43.500564855476306
6756. it was all the pride he had	142.40697345577482
6757. i guess fooling hans and me took	doing	167.2071480585223
6758. but he didn't figure ma for much	140.63139997264315
6759. he didn't figure her	at all and if he found out	h a woman h it'd be bad	1577.8064055743885
6760. hans	poured some in a tumbler	65.40020415726184
6761. you going to put more towels on him	168.87513637264632
6762. no	0.30041514999999996
6763. why not	0.20041515
6764. that's what he needs	something warm to his skin don't he	748.6569532284652
6765. not where	he's froze good	14.845435067151811
6766. that's why i only	put towels on his chest and belly	758.4070730584178
6767. he's got to thaw slow	14.796208699524758
6768. you ought	to know that	22.158185962231165
6769. colors on the towels had run	43.90412319968412
6770. ma poked	her toe in the kid's clothes	251.95049848335324
6771. what are we going to do	with these	167.84061521011785
6772. big hans began pouring whisky in the kid's	mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in	a second it was dripping from his chin	4646.5513491415495
6773. here help me prop	him up	43.65720338381187
6774. i got hold his mouth open	65.35638515801915
6775. i didn't want to touch	him and i hoped ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's	clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't	make any move to	4052.400507900831
6776. lift don't shove h lift	22.364313009600483
6777. i took him by the shoulders	43.392194406632576
6778. his mouth fell open	4.444249702078861
6779. the skin on his neck was tight	93.67806686435057
6780. he	was cold all right	22.18372370888455
6781. his mouth is open	2.964880335361216
6782. he'll choke anyway	0.30041514999999996
6783. don't hold him like	that	14.808003514256432
6784. put your arms around him	22.398321387851958
6785. he was cold all right	14.799367857029358
6786. i put my arm carefully around him	141.9551793916098
6787. hans had	his fingers in the kid's mouth	167.1045796287737
6788. now he'll choke for sure	22.130822403534637
6789. just hold him like i told you	94.08556849746594
6790. he	was cold all right and wet	140.7599656045913
6791. i had my arm behind his back	93.8058621731742
6792. he was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of	his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost	a decade since he had sworn off lecturing	5771.763487909613
6793. there was never a doubt	any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same	unqualified success now	2022.9075374362678
6794. he could no longer build anything whether	a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil	without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there	he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique	they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the	public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality	of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an	artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other	values	0.30166232349522504
6795. stowey rummel was internationally famous a crafter of a genuine	americana in foreign eyes an original designer whose inventive	childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere	by his personality	3561.7177917140752
6796. he had lived for almost thirty years in this	same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing	in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning made himself some	french coffee had his corn flakes and more coffee smoked four cigarettes	while reading last sunday's herald tribune and yesterday's	pittsburgh gazette then put on his high-topped farmer's	shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop	0.30166232349522504
6797. this was an enormously	long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought	home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist	2982.381406383694
6798. the debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of	wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying	on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support	to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting	out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he	was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through	a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each	floor	0.30166232349522504
6799. his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only	clean island in the chaos	1426.655108135087
6800. everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in	visible form: his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes	from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books	that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac	6360.681146463752
6801. bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for	the camden cycly company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over	his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller	skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house	5279.000470411507
6802. he worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he	were merely stopping for a moment sketching with the surprised stare	of one who was watching another person's hand	5120.83627489398
6803. sometimes he would	grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would	look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved	2608.7538192957054
6804. it	all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows-	as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's	neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's	work	6191.69289629295
6805. this air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude	toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him	or a surrender to repetitious routine	2983.5879189823527
6806. but he was not bored at	all;	he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite	wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he	should alter it	6053.977991979464
6807. there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything	but only know how to listen to what is good for them and stowey	was as things go a fortunate man	3220.656669670024
6808. he left his home the	day after new year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and	without a hat	2623.97946026023
6809. he would wear this same costume in florida despite his	wife cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take	some cool clothes with him	2863.201151714726
6810. but he was too busy to hear what she was	saying	749.6556664614329
6811. so they parted when she was in an impatient humor	375.8598026339823
6812. when he	was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser	cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before	she came out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her	head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad	and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window	8569.51010050667
6813. finding	the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it warmed up	he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog and said defrost	the refrigerator	3209.6736010008144
6814. he saw the surprise in her face and	laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen	2820.955590400804
6815. he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him	371.8139394336606
6816. he had a deep	voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor;	an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it	4081.846770981293
6817. he would	settle himself into his seat to laugh	260.50073403553415
6818. whenever he laughed it was	all he was doing	390.02833197118485
6819. and she was made to fall in love with him again there	in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was	at his going away when he really didn't have to mad at their both	having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a	week to go by	5470.818740987875
6820. she was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding	with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple	or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn	sort of prayer	6093.982722251886
6821. her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two	lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair	that fell to her shoulders	2982.3073241574843
6822. there was an air of blindness in her	gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women	who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from	money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact	6570.332826618513
6823. she was	personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the	same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her	waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves	4289.341087849114
6824. but just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood	she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking	breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to	rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history	so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she	was and adamant on certain questions of personal value	0.30166232349522504
6825. she even spoke	differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure	and her voice clear and rather sharp	2321.1284454445527
6826. now drive carefully	for god's sake! she called trying to attain a half humorous	resentment at his departure	2344.677358693759
6827. but he did not notice and was already	backing the car down to the road saying toot-toot! to the	stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the	car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to	have removed	5041.71780447699
6828. she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until	he had swung the car onto the road	2127.31663248095
6829. then when he had it pointed	down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window	1574.0444352712252
6830. she had	begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood	still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be	a	serious word of farewell	5143.297448778507
6831. he looked at her out of himself she thought	as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised	her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and	his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the	gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate	gallery on a thursday once	5740.24711998999
6832. now she kept herself protectively ready	to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger	and said toot! once more and roared off into the fog his foot	evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed	the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked	7707.008811461106
6833. she walked back	to the house and entered feeling herself returning sensing some kind	of opportunity in the empty building	1880.5113569146718
6834. there is a death in all partings	she knew and promptly put it out of her mind	2105.987639875476
6835. she enjoyed	great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking	all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially	alone in her house was the realest part of life	3853.2509286491345
6836. now she could let out	the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that stowey	would let them out one of the doors; she could dust the plants	then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the	middle	on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and finally the best part of	all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine	and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering	nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing	and desire	0.30166232349522504
6837. she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running	down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon	it was getting to be	2731.502092706923
6838. she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the	house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own	these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and	the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and	walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm	8364.870757352885
6839. every	few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: stowey	yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and	nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner	and bringing three guests of hers	4678.946294815653
6840. then she fell asleep again as soddenly	as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside	and the clarity was back in her eyes	4471.945060931581
6841. she stood up smoothing her hair	down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping	darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of	the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in	or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed	a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her	head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia	to come with her guests	0.20124717349522497
6842. she went into the living room and turned on	three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling	light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating	the driveway	5845.954726141042
6843. she knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at	herself	505.18019065315656
6844. they were both so young after all so unready for any final	parting	1183.065400922322
6845. how could it have been thirty years already she wondered	374.27414390507084
6846. but yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine	and she had been married at nineteen	2346.617321696708
6847. she stood still over the leg	of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea	in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started	her shivering	3638.7604532111204
6848. but they all said no your time will come	391.5786976595904
6849. enjoy being a	bride while you can	94.41170669697021
6850. there was no room for company in the	tiny weaning house		390.92054963485623
6851. so when the	big house filled up and ran over the sisters-in-law found beds for	everyone in their own homes	1888.1129178429383
6852. and there was still not anything that linda	kay could do	749.5214803310794
6853. so linda kay gave up asking and accepted	her reprieve	374.1711431777061
6854. without saying so she was really grateful; for to	attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly	had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as bobby	joe's wife	5779.7138112909915
6855. she had made curtains for all the windows of her	little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was	and cooked good meals for bobby joe	3327.957999331539
6856. she had done all the things she	had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this	2821.688399114985
6857. people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway	at night	1262.5480136715819
6858. bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in	for dinner and sometimes not for supper	2110.5176657959473
6859. when they first married he	had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and	drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal	3664.198326233699
6860. now	there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained	and she did not know where he went	3483.9429038880344
6861. not that she complained or had any	cause to	262.44966884620527
6862. four or five of the cousins from east texas were about	his age so naturally they ran around together	2592.190488346459
6863. there was no reason	for her to ask what they did	494.1966220598523
6864. thus a new pattern of days began	to develop for granny albright did not die	1631.1854338186226
6865. she lay still on the	bed her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened her eyes	and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup	3123.320868593907
6866. they	stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next	day or two	2121.1978168043092
6867. those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would	not go home for she might die any time; but they might as well	unpack their suitcases for she might linger on	3549.7697033972167
6868. so the pattern	was established	22.223822033046776
6869. when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes	and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the big house	2047.4872526896477
6870. there	was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was	or would be	2121.0675225513287
6871. bobby joe and the boys would come by say how's granny	502.24222027779024
6872. and sit on the porch a while	141.24241832462752
6873. the older men would be there	at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off	to the creek or drove down the road towards town	3231.43830367922
6874. the women and	children stayed at the albrights'	251.60767032077166
6875. the women keeping their voices	low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded	like chickens shut up in a coop for the night	3126.5358091208536
6876. the children had to	play away from the house	to maintain a proper quietness	1407.2848374711286
6877. off and on all day someone	would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything	1577.2440615718044
6878. the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room and	her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the house stayed open	though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that	way	6181.571430508137
6879. the dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them	so that the women were always making ice water	1729.7673345074315
6880. they had cleaned	up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town	as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for	the crowds who ate and drank there	5754.403259576963
6881. one afternoon as the women	sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate	1573.303903920319
6882. it was a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows	closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would	be cool and unwrinkled	5175.6550822165345
6883. they were an old fat couple	a thick middle-aged man and a girl about	ten or twelve	1423.0805015015737
6884. there was much embracing much exclaiming	64.9426127250234
6885. cousin	ada! cousin john! cousin lura! cousin	howard! and how is she	642.3464430169338
6886. about the same john	about	the same	141.50745270039718
6887. all the women got up and offered their chairs and	when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and	their explanations	2466.729801162874
6888. we were on our vacation in canada	howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming	and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home	5310.354499427136
6889. we came on as soon as we could	167.86970545061766
6890. there was the suggestion	of ice water and- in spite of the protest we're not really	thirsty- linda kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering	soft voices hurried to the kitchen	5303.526541049911
6891. she filled a big pitcher	and set it with glasses on a tray	789.7522882249583
6892. carrying it to the living room	she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated	in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she	had learned as a twirler with the school band	6231.758358216597
6893. almost immediately she	was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a	place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she	entered the room	3542.16496294654
6894. howard was looking	at her	22.071585985653865
6895. she felt the look and looked back because she could not help	it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first	believed	3120.832710338583
6896. and who is this	4.409196561168942
6897. he asked when she passed	him a glass	167.19616966168837
6898. oh that's linda kay mama albright	said fondly	249.8325622332195
6899. she married our baby boy bobby joe this summer	259.7026043469791
6900. let's see cousin ada said	22.110905902964888
6901. he's a right smart	younger than the rest	168.22528803707056
6902. oh yes mama laughed	4.444178073004935
6903. he's	ten years younger than ernest	43.59999641706428
6904. we didn't expect him to come	along; thought for the longest he was a tumor	1648.7181180878154
6905. this joke	was not funny to linda kay and she blushed as she always did;	then hearing the muffled boom of howard's laughter blushed redder	2594.3703220379616
6906. who is howard anyway	4.4586896282693935
6907. she asked bobby joe that	night	43.50813581910553
6908. oh he's a second	cousin or something	141.01619344574388
6909. he got in the oil business out at odessa and	lucked into some money	945.5932389553451
6910. how old is he	4.433244068775883
6911. gosh	i don't know	2.962337103120379
6912. he's been married and	got this half-grown kid	250.5610561867755
6913. if he bothers you don't pay him any mind	262.57430570402346
6914. he's just a big windbag	22.316542201267517
6915. bobby joe was thinking about something	else	94.14160620020554
6916. say did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope	season on the double x	1884.8825132461527
6917. he was talking about antelope	again when they woke up	372.7854637471947
6918. listen i never had a chance to	kill an antelope	563.7558706336051
6919. there never was a season before but now they want	to thin 'em out on account of the drouth	1714.1187438927573
6920. did he ever	visit here when he was a kid	562.8566712248903
6921. linda kay asked	0.20041515
6922. when he	was a kid i wasn't around	252.39189568015303
6923. bobby joe took a gun from behind	the door and with a quick bye now was gone for the day	1889.5706719282894
6924. almost immediately howard and his daughter debora drove up in	the cadillac	961.0600935322784
6925. we're going after ice howard said	and	thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company	1256.3453659989807
6926. there	was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in	a cadillac	1877.9350176276944
6927. driving along the caliche-topped road to town howard	talked	261.6286733243218
6928. finally he said tell me about yourself and linda	kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting	life	3478.978031294093
6929. she was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler	future farmers sweetheart and secretary of future homemakers	1574.112452536423
6930. in her sophomore year she had started going steady with bobby joe	who was a football player future homemakers sweetheart and president	of future farmers	3871.7781552270744
6931. it was easy to see that they were made for	each other and they knew what they wanted	1556.6485863648968
6932. bobby joe would be a senior	this year and he planned to graduate	1187.1748215624732
6933. but there was no need for	linda kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home	for bobby joe and raise his children	3095.478326116863
6934. you lucky kids he said	22.189643826883902
6935. i'd give anything if i could	have found a girl like you	650.3099743433651
6936. then he told linda kay about himself	140.19429592624073
6937. of course he couldn't say much really because of debora but	linda kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and	what a raw deal he had got	3337.0714613858736
6938. it made her feel different about howard	140.89923440669546
6939. she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had	been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they	did was talk about antelope	3318.880192908114
6940. bobby joe was trying to get linda	kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home	2588.0770279806775
6941. cook	a whole antelope	2.942393411437914
6942. she exclaimed	0.30041514999999996
6943. why i couldn't even cook	a piece of antelope steak; i never even saw any	1098.2655072307318
6944. i want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys	1189.6528486068992
6945. linda kay told him he couldn't do anything like that	with his grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didn't	they they weren't all dying	2978.6537819205137
6946. linda kay felt like going off to the	bedroom to cry; but they were going up to the big house after supper	and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little	5925.356974558765
6947. every night they all went to mama and papa albright's and	sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze	2332.193109654658
6948. it was	full-of-the-moon and nearly light as day	253.33914128283897
6949. they all	sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had	a good time	1574.7018349432901
6950. once in a while they said what a shame it was with granny	dying but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other	way	4057.7755703107905
6951. that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting	on a moonlight night	1105.8034546603772
6952. bobby joe and two or three of the	other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting and uncle bill	farnworth said he would	just get	up from there and take them right then	5333.538674390539
6953. after they	had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places	to sit	1417.155090664238
6954. there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit	on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others	liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall	5813.977695314219
6955. howard	who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air	and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been	sitting	3239.843380298934
6956. you'll be a darn sight more comfortable there howard	ernest said laughing and they all laughed	1878.0034388976055
6957. linda	kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable	372.85341654782894
6958. bobby joe had	been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand	from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer	4612.823050592278
6959. perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of	it seemed to come in contact with hers; but she had never been so aware	of anyone's flesh before	3660.709458547671
6960. still she was not sorry he sat	by her but in fact was flattered	1397.9030567662803
6961. he had become the center of the	company such stories he had to tell	941.3382217665991
6962. he had sold oil stock to bob hope	and bing crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire	that raged six days and nights	4092.699153390787
6963. but tell me doctor where do you plan to conduct the hatching	646.2200853622342
6964. alex asked	0.30041514999999996
6965. that will have to be in the hotel	the doctor retorted confirming alex's anticipations	941.5665927475229
6966. what i	want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning	and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel	4116.348536241342
6967. the doctor paid	the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate	alex further into these undertakings	2029.4028546668644
6968. the doctor opened	the smallest of his cases an unimposing straw bag and exposed the contents	for alex's inspection	2599.1766408621243
6969. inside carefully packed in straw	were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect	what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside; to alex	they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs	3732.329292956917
6970. there was little enough	time to contemplate them however; in an instant the doctor was stalking	across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly	eared and big as a table top	5452.10578523615
6971. he placed it on alex's lap	43.442200874056326
6972. this is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way	962.8650287597578
6973. it's	been going since 1908 when i was a junior in college	639.2754519624949
6974. that first	entry there is the vermont flumenophobe the earliest and one of	the most successful of my eighty-three varieties- great big scapulars	and hardly any primaries at all	4652.764254470936
6975. couldn't take them near a river	though or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before thanksgiving	1581.369367243839
6976. the ledger was full of most precise information:	date of laying length of incubation period number of chicks reaching	the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of rooster's	wattles and so on all scrawled out in a hand that looked more	chinese than english the most jagged and sprawling alex had ever seen	8011.1901705260625
6977. below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected	by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed	1879.6481943312604
6978. alex's	instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the rue	ecole de medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip	of wine to sustain him through them all	5632.940016744851
6979. but after the doctor's return	that night alex could see from the high window in his own room	the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels	apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it	was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen	4917.600276980147
6980. a knocking at	alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning	1185.6536154230437
6981. it	was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and	alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste	2171.5988610709737
6982. the doctor stood about	waiting for alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they	were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways	past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street	6202.6648465902545
6983. the	market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of immediacy	left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him	2992.622109812125
6984. he stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled	with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked	with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese	5777.504677434141
6985. the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be	done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery	2312.420212229585
6986. it was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking	abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen	3705.7783081129396
6987. the doctor	with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope	drew alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise	have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles the length and	quality of neck and saddle hackles the firm wide spread of the	toes and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets	5515.481084091215
6988. all search	was ended; he had found his fowl	392.2801461106943
6989. the purchase was effected and	they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some	sort of communication had been set up nestling in the doctor's arms	3245.2302013854123
6990. the clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel	entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still	be abed began to rise in alex's well exercised breast	4658.774147565865
6991. the doctor	was wearing a long new england greatcoat hardly necessary in the	june weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration	of hens	2868.4661872315082
6992. alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who	for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where	the hen was cradled	4267.260959991721
6993. they advanced in a line across the entrance	hall	to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing	2044.1065640888385
6994. it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in	some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them	as they gained the landing	4491.105462578997
6995. bonjour messieurs vous etes	matinals she greeted them pleasantly	261.2335006390526
6996. alex explained that they had	been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around	behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind	alex's arm and back	5317.698601339444
6997. vous voulez vos petits dejeuners	tout de suite alors	262.9129141499915
6998. their hostess enquired	0.30041514999999996
6999. alex told her that	there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to	effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him	2983.9008174021983
7000. the	doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs	but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible	cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well	5349.178264249042
7001. eyes swerved	in the patronne's head alex coughed loudly and the doctor	with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs	in long-shanked leaps	2989.3770695148773
7002. comment	0.30041514999999996
7003. ejaculated the surprised	woman looking at alex for an explanation but he parting from	her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's	provincial american speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands	of his work	4317.8803019823845
7004. with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her	suspicious	gaze	959.2211589360822
7005. when alex entered his room the doctor was already	preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the hen's	attentions	2324.7886584606727
7006. there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his	powers being absorbed by this more immediate business	2589.5190808941607
7007. the hen appeared	to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down	to the performance of them	2170.5115220009866
7008. one part of her audience was totally engaged	the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some	ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive	as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does	not fully understand	6808.997909978108
7009. the spectacle progressed towards a denouement which	was obviously still remote; the audience attended	943.7424408028488
7010. time elapsed	but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome	knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature	3468.8726176887676
7011. startled	he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the	door	1561.1731141605276
7012. he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling	coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations	from the hen who had begun to protest	5183.556314146306
7013. it was giselle the fille de	chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with	ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand alex	could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could	to calm the displeased bird	4903.002808306585
7014. giselle was reluctant but alex succeeded	in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut	again	3029.4457826301914
7015. who was that young feller	15.01332911070688
7016. the doctor instantly	asked	4.407785960195587
7017. that was the fille de chambre the one you thought	couldn't get the eggs out	1101.6645124852132
7018. she looked mighty interested though	22.334602956661094
7019. anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room	504.99671063891503
7020. the doctor's mind was working at a great speed; he rose to put	his greatcoat on and addressed alex in a muted voice	3498.0771451727
7021. have	you got our keys handy	43.19273815212365
7022. right in my pocket	4.4433774786859646
7023. now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe	371.2799657693812
7024. the hall was empty and alex beckoned; they climbed the stairs	which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next	floor	3715.2827398849413
7025. a guest was locking his room; they passed behind him and	got to alex's room unnoticed	1255.9709359380668
7026. the doctor sat down rather wearily	caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a	poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this	door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more	7038.382123564617
7027. at	the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille	de chambre to return in ten minutes	1567.445930163951
7028. it was evident that a second	transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the	time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began	alex's	5338.374750004547
7029. they waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe;	the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine	and listened at the door	2978.2285130886103
7030. a bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows	being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside;	they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced	another important fact	4828.471316126534
7031. the doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned	the doorknob but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied	1740.3729208422858
7032. although	a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements	but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged	from number nine	4662.4821422822015
7033. alex suppressed those expressions of relief which	offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted	they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre	his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower	room	4735.424572511095
7034. the events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to	any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard	had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails	perhaps mourning her nest but briefly enjoyed	6802.975770734131
7035. the doctor's	wits had not left him however for all his sixty-eight years and the	wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out	from the showerhead	3214.877865053809
7036. alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual	were taking place and entered the doctor's room	2133.621354145304
7037. shortly the doctor	himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently	satisfied with the outcome of their adventures	2031.1479066958716
7038. without comment he	opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around	the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside	3909.3158717801184
7039. next the hen	was nested and all seemed well	260.2754600268154
7040. the two men sat for some time savoring	the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings	before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference	house and alex to go to the main post office	6932.510599378504
7041. alex returned	to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role	in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood	2856.862615573019
7042. at	the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication	with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully	after the occurrences of the morning	5175.982989329281
7043. chickens have short	memories the doctor remarked that's why they are better company	than most people i know and he went on to break some important	news to alex	3093.4576170934515
7044. well he began it seems like some people	in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference	house do	3904.022549390029
7045. they've got a big vulture from tanganika at the	zoo here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the	only vulturidae of their species outside africa	3345.576673834797
7046. seems like	she's	willing but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy	who took jeannie may behind the barn and then didn't know what to	do and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show	for their trouble	7046.2757768054
7047. going downstairs with the tray winston wished he could have	given in to miss ada but he knew better than to do what she said when	she had that little-girl look	3335.9925876161665
7048. there were times it wasn't right	to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked	for a peanut butter sandwich	4105.593112261921
7049. you know we don't keep peanut butter	in this house he always told her	935.0354195955395
7050. why winston she'd	cry i just now saw you eating it out of the jar! but he	knew how important it was for her to keep her figure	4436.120393409362
7051. in the	kitchen leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper	790.7600252716186
7052. her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool	1419.734989627364
7053. here winston said gently what's these dishes doing not	washed	375.53852823502103
7054. the enormous plates which had held mr jack's four	fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink	3259.9081189571234
7055. leave me alone leona said	14.775868206819037
7056. can't you see i'm	busy	22.262019344015748
7057. she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper	504.9957252374319
7058. this is moving day winston reminded her and i bet	you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the	floor and the bed not made	4495.349576232233
7059. leona! his eye had fastened on her	leg; bending he touched her knee	787.3065845072917
7060. if i catch you one more time	down here without stockings-   she twitched her leg away	1889.505830214412
7061. she had an alley cat's manners	43.96498073457536
7062. winston stacked miss ada's thin pink dishes in the sink	562.454486240846
7063. then he	spread out the last list on the counter	375.7586366573333
7064. to be left behind	was printed at the top in miss ada; fine hand	1400.2019786915228
7065. winston took out	a pencil admired the point and wrote slowly and heavily clothes	stand	1101.2957395200767
7066. sighing leona dropped the paper and stood up	251.68654462681357
7067. i	guess i better get ready to go	166.500359294734
7068. winston watched her fumbling	to untie her apron	248.71062953931914
7069. carefully he undid the bow	14.910755501564378
7070. how come your bows is always cockeyed	142.54266200874525
7071. she turned and	put her arms around his neck	261.8047235702206
7072. i don't want to leave here winston	139.88399052044363
7073. he drew back embarrassed	and pleased	43.42203032112891
7074. i thought you was sick to death of this big house	747.840424565534
7075. said	you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms	375.63836147093286
7076. at	least there is room here she said	251.62303117111506
7077. what room is there going	to be in an apartment for any child	781.788519401649
7078. i told you what	miss ada's doctor said	247.63144940716742
7079. i don't mean miss ada!	what you think i care about that	639.9436016181642
7080. i mean our children	4.437948739307197
7081. she	sounded as though they already existed	93.86928438791395
7082. in spite of the hundred	things he had on his mind winston went and put his arm around her	waist	2834.190410162019
7083. we've got plenty of time to think about that	259.54876466351004
7084. all the	time in the world	65.50407440952519
7085. we've only been married four years january	94.21496400361832
7086. that's a long time waiting	22.110185157778922
7087. how many times have i told you- he began and	was almost glad when she cut him off- too many times!-	and flounced to the sink where she began noisily to wash her hands	3654.382006904042
7088. too many times was the truth of it winston thought	558.688835472989
7089. he hardly	believed his reason himself any more	165.52479155813526
7090. although it had seemed a good	reason to begin with: no couple could afford to have children	2116.4697180006888
7091. how you going to work with a child hanging on you	505.0293035712506
7092. he asked	leona	0.30041514999999996
7093. you want to keep this job don't you	167.04881551832804
7094. he doubted	whether she heard him over the running water	563.316036180952
7095. he sat for a	while with his hands on his knees watching the bend of her back as she	gathered up her things- a comb a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs	and pack	3651.8401171543264
7096. she made him sad some days and he was never sure why;	it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the	quick jerky way she bent	4991.72318266556
7097. she was too young that was all; too young	and thin and straight	792.5508205575602
7098. winston!   it was mr	jack bellowing out in the hall	559.0438490366739
7099. winston hurried through the swinging	door	43.34021513649714
7100. i've been bursting my lungs for you mr jack	complained	560.6959497983642
7101. he was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie	504.7284205022553
7102. he had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief	case lay on the bench	2591.965910000801
7103. i don't know what you think you've been	doing about my clothes he said	947.3132702392292
7104. this coat looks like a rag heap	141.634725501711
7105. there were a few blades of lint on the shoulder	374.45460259427864
7106. winston	took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work	961.387873011907
7107. he gave mr	jack a real going-over; he brushed his shoulders and his back	and his collar with long firm strokes	2023.435245582584
7108. hey! mr jack cried	when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes	1426.047413591424
7109. winston	apologized and quickly set the hat right	167.82564776477358
7110. then he stood back to look	at mr jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves	1878.0729195143097
7111. winston enjoyed	seeing him start out; he wore his clothes with style	643.8969420792503
7112. when he was	going to town nothing was good enough- he had cursed at winston	once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace	3876.7943520031185
7113. at home he wouldn't	even wash his hands for supper and he wandered around the yard	in a pair of sweaty old corduroys	2335.4157970179986
7114. the velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray	wine and blue which miss ada had bought him hung brushed and	unworn in the closet	3056.1772590352075
7115. good-by winston mr jack said	giving a final set to his hat	639.5295766688862
7116. look out for those movers!	winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome	fine-looking man it made him proud to see	3920.230038523575
7117. after mr jack	drove away winston went on looking out the window	643.6067507984369
7118. he noticed a speck	of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger	1883.0101644478648
7119. then he looked	at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he	used like a knife to pry up slit and open	2740.5456174282017
7120. for the first time he	let himself be sad about the move	958.884279987981
7121. that house was ten years off his life	167.5886642422678
7122. each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how	to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long	glass drops which hung from the chandelier	5771.254759396632
7123. he knew the house like	a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all	the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up	3545.020326022389
7124. ten years	ago he had come to the house to be interviewed	959.4693859868272
7125. the tulips and the	big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked	up from the bus almost singing	2355.76061079551
7126. miss ada had been out back in a straw	hat planting flowers	965.0137302926383
7127. she had talked to him right there with the	hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed	2037.931629930179
7128. winston	had been surprised at her for that	247.18962359555343
7129. still he had liked the way she	had looked in a fresh neat cotton dress- citron yellow if he remembered	1900.1322421555185
7130. she had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too	tan	1193.823955996982
7131. since then the flowers she had planted had spread all	over the hill	795.9460021638229
7132. already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front	gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps	3491.231617675547
7133. in a week the hyacinths would spike out	167.32190215587283
7134. and the dogwood in early	may for miss ada's alfresco party; and after that the japanese	cherries	2108.6795450847812
7135. now the yard looked wet and bald the trees bare under their	buds but in a while miss ada's flowers would bloom like a marching	parade	2746.217682694053
7136. she had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with	her writing on it; where would she go for her gardening now	4111.434835316475
7137. somehow	winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes	261.83149054230944
7138. sighing	he hurried to the living room	141.80271737983804
7139. he had a thousand things to see	to	166.96728540651463
7140. still he couldn't help thinking we're all getting old getting	small; the snail is pulling in her horns	2347.2106277986595
7141. in the living	room miss ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in	her hand	1714.0045541282573
7142. she was looking out at the garden	140.99308298546015
7143. winston	she said get the basket for the breakables	262.86271305277495
7144. winston had	the big straw basket ready in the hall	562.5941958605932
7145. he brought it in and put	it down beside her	373.6775113652318
7146. miss ada was looking fine; she had on her easter	suit blue with lavender binding	1638.3420226500266
7147. halfway across the house he	could have smelled her morning perfume	503.8059272520055
7148. it hung in all her day clothes	sweet and strong; sometimes when he was pressing winston raised	her dresses to his face	3246.1759113756993
7149. frowning miss ada studied the list	43.82421810545054
7150. the china lemon tree	4.45253123505288
7151. winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail	objects and wrapping them	in tissue paper	1424.6732031049462
7152. neither of them trusted the movers	65.30517745264935
7153. when they	came to mr jack's photograph twenty by twelve inches in a curly	silver frame miss ada said by rights i ought to leave that	seeing he won't take my clotheshorse	3424.6371188329613
7154. she smiled at winston	and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes	1414.763195252579
7155. he picked up the photograph	and began to wrap it	374.34763798938417
7156. at least you could leave it	for the movers miss ada said	952.516960214158
7157. what possessed you to tell me	a clotheshorse would be a good idea	787.7694226567406
7158. winston folded the	tissue paper carefully	65.56749268952434
7159. he's used it every day; every morning	i lay out his clothes on it	943.8048186912156
7160. and it was his main present! leave that fool picture out she added	sharply	1395.433281614926
7161. winston laid it in the basket	43.503411465992585
7162. mr jack sets	store by that	64.54536800666445
7163. it was meant to be	my present	93.0955327609807
7164. but she went on down the list	142.1262382155187
7165. winston was	relieved; those presents had been on his mind	376.0436483300328
7166. he had only agreed	with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested	the photograph to mr jack	3043.229695173078
7167. you know what she likes winston	he had said wearily one evening in november when winston was	pulling off his overshoes	2036.9698682486135
7168. tell me what to get her for christmas	248.25848396707153
7169. she's been talking about a picture winston had told	him	376.95632770254343
7170. picture! you mean picture of me	64.45553387317673
7171. but winston	had persuaded him	14.820772032275965
7172. on christmas night they had had a disagreement	about it	564.5264474441083
7173. winston had heard because he was setting up the	liquor tray in the next room	1099.6937644351383
7174. through the door he had seen mr jack	walking around waiting for miss ada	1410.1109590016852
7175. finally she had come down;	winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk	hostess gown	1874.1569142987469
7176. how do you like it	22.2184983151768
7177. she had asked	0.20041515
7178. mr jack had said you look about fifteen years old	568.9018287061041
7179. is that a compliment	2.9498118069241857
7180. i don't know	0.30041514999999996
7181. he had	stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around	next and look at the back of her head	2470.513862193794
7182. lovie you make	me feel naked	64.91648380720486
7183. miss ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling	to the couch and sank down	1264.1759789210796
7184. you look like that picture	i have at the office mr jack had started	1412.996227086003
7185. not a line	not a wrinkle	43.40000086216989
7186. i look like an old man compared and he had picked	up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on it	3279.9096439722525
7187. will you wear pink when you're sixty	94.1581367943836
7188. darling	i love that photograph	22.28134504365136
7189. i'm going to put it on my dresser	167.30890713341273
7190. i guess it's children make a woman old	251.79611106883567
7191. a man gets	old anyhow	14.842654548059532
7192. after a minute he went on people must think the	curse is on me seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray	3904.4272342484023
7193. i'll give you a medical certificate framed if you like	miss ada had said	945.09546917225
7194. all i want is a picture- with	a few lines	563.141286842538
7195. make the man put them in if he has to	375.1262243980447
7196. after	that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word	961.3110514943495
7197. then miss	ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs	643.3041165798003
7198. was it love	0.30041514999999996
7199. i had no doubt that it was	92.5637570650282
7200. during the rest of the summer	my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of	catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly	renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation	and delight	6672.444697184171
7201. nothing in all the preceding years had	had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than	the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing	of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the	world	5037.802823194528
7202. in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across	the river from new york i would nearly cry	2598.3905646124117
7203. my parents' welcoming	arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted	263.42078983326587
7204. but that year was	different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had	intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer	gave promise of continuing into the fall: jessica and i about to	be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the	immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed	to correspond	8747.133462707028
7205. these letters became the center of my existence	166.3059304345796
7206. i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock	myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth	time and finally prepare an answer	5625.543025070073
7207. my memory has catalogued for easy	reference and withdrawal the image of her pink scented stationery and	the unsloped almost printed configurations of her neat studious handwriting	with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences	beginning with remember when h; and others concerning	camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood and news of her	commencing again her piano lessons her private school a visit to	boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned	on furlough wounded from the war in europe	0.20124717349522497
7208. in my letters	i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real	life	2359.0660474037613
7209. then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting	cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting	from the books i read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended	by a teacher in whose special after-school class i was enrolled	4546.9468510036
7210. the letters took their source from a stream of my imagination	in which i was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate eliot	sands- he of the porch steps anecdotes- who smoked cigarettes	performed the tango wore fifty dollar suits and sneaked off into	the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them	8000.949971791039
7211. like eliot	in my fantasies i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely	continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing	and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently	to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented	by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses	burning with love	5709.733259608654
7212. the night after reading her letter about her surgeon	uncle- it must have been late in september- i had a vision	of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying	my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power	of her love bringing me back to life	7611.568009374818
7213. for many nights afterward the	idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return	and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie	awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep	sleep	4665.030303886613
7214. the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew	the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became	2600.7079582094248
7215. they	caused my love for jessica to become warmer and at the same time more	hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever	bring me the courage to ask to see her again	3944.8751616467684
7216. as it turned out	jessica took matters	into her own hands	749.4038337750908
7217. having received permission	to give a camp reunion-halloween party she asked that i come and	be her date	1565.9502199591802
7218. i went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself	1183.1443395562944
7219. again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates i was shy with	jessie and acted as i had during those early saturday mornings when	we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned	with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in	the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate	romance	5632.5198971970085
7220. i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the	hostess serving soft drinks to her guests	2119.646078151254
7221. she was wearing her dark	hair in two thick braids to attain an american girl effect	she thought was appropriate to halloween	2170.6347011493094
7222. it made her look sweet and	schoolgirlish i was excited to be with her but i did not know how	to express it	3452.252125319038
7223. yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous	letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out	of my mind and plant himself in reality	3223.8788248404303
7224. it was late we were playing	kissing games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front	of the others	3248.7578308283805
7225. we blushed and were flustered and it turned out to	be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek	1556.8750688470964
7226. the kiss outraged our friends	but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting	premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that i had	imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me	6052.918273474405
7227. it was	at that party that finally overcoming my timidity inspired by tales	only half-understood and overheard among older boys i asked jessie	to spend new year's eve with me	3204.6112604766
7228. lovingly she accepted and so	great was my emotion that all i could think of saying was you're	amazing you know	3038.0818002756105
7229. later we agreed to think of how we wished	to spend that night	784.7981710375735
7230. we would write to one another and make a definite	plan	756.0284211295436
7231. among my school and neighborhood	friends during the next months i bragged and swaggered and	pompously described my impending date	1885.5649652283275
7232. but though i boasted and gave	off a dapper front i was beneath it all frightened	1884.5434350764176
7233. it would be the	first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved	1427.0472590981697
7234. i had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl	or how one behaved: should i hold her hand while walking or only	when crossing the street	5012.133196058453
7235. should i bring along a corsage or send	one to her	504.4563597628069
7236. was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city	960.3999121109607
7237. should i accompany her to the door of her home or should i ask to	be invited in	1564.129436825528
7238. in or out should i kiss her goodnight	250.56427928262048
7239. all this	was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most	important night of the year!   when in one letter jessica informed	me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone	on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief; but	the letter went on: she had cried she had implored she had been miserable	at his refusal and finally he had relented- and now how happy	she was how expectant!   her optimism gave me heart	0.20124717349522497
7240. i forced	confidence into myself	22.503055352693746
7241. i made inquiries i read a book of etiquette	260.77683588934883
7242. in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet	on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that i had learned	was the most sophisticated	4665.911159035257
7243. we would attend a film and later on	i stated we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or child's	or toffenetti's for waffles	2469.9784437578414
7244. i set the hour of our meeting for seven	391.53573950354945
7245. at five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind	my closed door i was dressing as carefully as a groom	2183.123150239947
7246. i wore a new	double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design	and wide lapels like a devil's ears	2847.089338261646
7247. my camp-made leather wallet bulky	with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money	i had been saving	1879.480376984287
7248. hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool	i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out	into the strangely still streets of brooklyn	4796.526514036026
7249. i felt superior to the	neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years	and was full of compliments for myself as i headed into the subway that	was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and	into the unstable tantalizing excitement of manhattan	4869.358217485798
7250. times	square when i ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers	dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant	was nearly impassable the sidewalks swarming with celebrants	with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls	and their rationed bottles of whiskey	7584.072305066422
7251. heavy-coated severe-looking	policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the	revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic	2317.826718091087
7252. the night	was cold but the crowd kept one warm	564.2764069734037
7253. the giant electric signs and	marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had	been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that	victory was just around the corner	3668.704892473156
7254. cardboard noisemakers substitutes	for the unavailable tin models were being hawked and bought at makeshift	stands every few yards along broadway and one's ears were continually	serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats	5335.432215312002
7255. an old gentlemen	next to me held a boy scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at	every fourth step and during the interim shouted out v for victory!	his neighbors cheered him on	3751.842385228932
7256. there was a great sense of	camaraderie	141.29791355570953
7257. how did one join them	14.725818963472737
7258. where were they all walking	to	64.94135826743698
7259. was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for jessica	791.8288367092566
7260. it was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the	other gallants who had established the astor steps as the beach-head	from which to launch their night of merrymaking	5334.637577256342
7261. i looked over their	faces and felt a twinge: they all looked so much more knowing than	i	1571.1501426274103
7262. i looked for jessica to materialize out of the	clogging curdling crowd and as the time passed and i waited a fiend	came to life beside me and whispered in my ear: how was i planning	to greet jessica	6165.280401740691
7263. where exactly would we go after the movie	168.52736467799403
7264. suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we	couldn't get in	2111.0961595769286
7265. suppose i hadn't brought along enough money	93.87803717255618
7266. i felt for my wallet	22.071171968704302
7267. its thick substantial outline calmed me	43.35796676946746
7268. but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to	wonder if something had gone wrong	2815.0125865387977
7269. suppose her father had changed his	mind and had refused to let her leave	943.5220414219178
7270. suppose at this very moment	her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans	2355.6471051968024
7271. i grew uneasy	0.20041515
7272. all about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings	taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous	greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays	into the festive night	5361.052939389351
7273. whole platoons were taking up new positions on	the steps arriving and departing while i stayed glued like a signpost	to one spot	2327.2474366636566
7274. at 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping	down the steps carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front	of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway and as i	watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground	their golden fringed epaulets and spic red-visored caps i suddenly	saw just over their shoulders jessica gracefully making her way through	the crowd	0.30166232349522504
7275. my heart almost stopped beating	14.794524136754362
7276. there were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning i left	for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating	2584.7152618962227

7278. i felt lonely	and depressed as i stared out the bus window at chicago's grim	dirty west side	2365.1798019763896
7279. it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous	drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients	that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to	a hospital for the mentally ill	4228.1610799548125
7280. i suddenly thought of mary	jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet	competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the	surface of her defenses	5161.796752603039
7281. we had become good friends during my	stay at cook county hospital	641.8981975800264
7282. i had told her enough about myself	to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers	after my little adventure in marshall field + co	3032.2831501732935
7283. she	knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had	once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university	to finish my medical studies	3653.740503926087
7284. she knew also that i was unmarried	and without a single known relative	1176.6859639063364
7285. she wasn't quite sure that	i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return	to it once i was out and on my own again	3087.4987597003865
7286. i read those newspaper stories about you she had said	565.326833345642
7287. you	must have loved that girl very much but you couldn't have meant	it when you said that you wanted to kill her	2323.932762873081

7362. it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane brennan	would believe it without proof	2133.9481480322347
7363. but i had the proof all documented	in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free	to do so	2467.45384444482
7364. as the bus turned into the main highway and headed	toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking	over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in	order	6075.563301794684
7365. i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings	coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined	it all	2461.4501124128965
7366. perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was	delusion; a figment of carl anderson's imagination	2113.6691378172395
7367. i	had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic	production called ask tony	1573.3971756638257
7368. it was a bad play real grade-a	turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of	capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal	4838.426160410568
7369. no	one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway	1260.0927938247391
7370. but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone	era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue	as a road company and eventually become a movie	5782.691139179804
7371. such optimism	was completely unjustified	14.97451656376962
7372. the critics literally screamed their	indignation	64.82375104591512
7373. ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled	on it in his sun-times column	1097.342203174498
7374. we opened on friday and	closed the following monday	393.20645283740055
7375. out of the entire cast i alone received	good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer	1414.4762290729896
7376. this let me	in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of	which were native chicagoans	3249.781217753501
7377. we were paid off tuesday morning	and given tickets back to new york	794.159181074404
7378. i felt lonely and depressed	as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel	1413.5840065827783
7379. it seemed to me that	my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another	1251.3050769023243
7380. i	had been among the top third in my class at nyu had wanted	desperately to go to medical school but i'd run out of money and	energy at the same time	5151.949233545095
7381. then later i had quit my safe secure five-a-week	spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play	2170.9167153197545
7382. it	seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well	1643.4697737608462
7383. i	knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital	or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another	acting job to open	3341.08329787737
7384. it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly	like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would	have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life	5588.5674483631465
7385. i	closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy	to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water	2978.061156223272
7386. when i answered it a voice too dignified and british to	be real said is this mr dale nelson the actor	3056.609195902984
7387. all right i said	2.9447784417316614
7388. why don't you bastards lay off for a	while	392.25393493527383

7396. yes of course mr	nelson	22.094995128901243
7397. i started to say something else appropriate but	the man had hung up	787.2866663976577
7398. i finally went downstairs to the bar off	the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over	the untimely passing of ask tony	4286.066830126626
7399. they all bowed low as i approached	them	167.31084581444875
7400. all right you bastards i said the great	actor is about to buy a drink	1654.6992025283944
7401. i laid a tenspot on the	bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round	1263.9444971576897

7404. you mr nelson	0.30041514999999996
7405. he asked	0.20041515
7406. mr wycoff's car is waiting	for you at the east entrance	757.3057349921953
7407. i followed him out through the	lobby to the street	374.6216479256085
7408. an ancient rolls-royce as shiningly	impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb	2593.760427277263
7409. the	elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention	holding open the door of the town car	1880.9145260705113
7410. i was giving the parked cars the once-over	251.97862823769697
7411. the oldsmobile with	the license number jyj 114 was in stall number five	786.2105775752759
7412. okay i said to the attendant i'll let you know if i close	the deal on the office in this building	3060.786724312697
7413. i walked with	him back to the entrance	168.2918296788946
7414. he gave me a ticket on the agency car and	parked it	964.9111385784572
7415. i was back in ten minutes	43.17883219916807
7416. forgot to get something	out of the car i told him showing him my ticket	1643.0843811424154
7417. he	started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and	said oh yes	1418.044483500169
7418. you're the one i was talking to about a monthly	rental	755.3999776143812
7419. that's right i told him	14.791544627707506
7420. he consulted	the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said you're	in the third row back toward the rear	3060.0851802988104
7421. can you find it all right	43.23914530883801
7422. sure i told him	4.442869439192954
7423. i went back to the agency	car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic	shadowing	2043.3532860375078
7424. i always keep a set in the car	252.33709292784124
7425. i put in new	batteries so as to be certain i'd have plenty of power and on my way	out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at	them thoughtfully	3544.2157871634236
7426. i waited until the parking attendant was busy	with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license	number jym 114 attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper	and walked out	5655.376905766479
7427. the attendant waved me on	14.745290222833157
7428. one of the	hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying	to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of	an office building and waiting	5190.484995902449
7429. for the first fifteen or twenty	minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays	then in people passing by	2319.477948552435
7430. after a while however a person's	mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical	symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment	4279.679222653306
7431. you want to sit down	14.963688199400073
7432. your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary	250.16962832834042
7433. you're conscious	of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard	1089.4823080087206
7434. i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office	building	1647.1065444908193
7435. i wasn't far behind him when	he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car	1422.3038424573047
7436. the attendant	recognized me once more and said what did you do about that	office	1648.71256344142
7437. i haven't made up my mind yet i said	261.3407397539561
7438. i have a couple of them i'm figuring on;	one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb	parking	3482.7755901785713
7439. that curb parking is undependable and annoying	particularly when it rains he said	784.5277897902092
7440. i kept trying to	get him to take my money	556.2185737720146
7441. i'm in a rush	right now	43.48956294294141
7442. i know where the car is	65.99770749791526
7443. want me to drive it out	43.34212651951977
7444. i'll have one of the boys get it he said	559.095659548336
7445. it's	one	of the rules on transients	94.36062603463222
7446. regulars drive out their own cars	65.69709084052707
7447. make it as snappy as you can will you	264.69322582346825
7448. i asked	0.30041514999999996
7449. oh that's all right he said	43.47001390727971
7450. you're going to be a regular	65.12169994797449
7451. you'll get in the office building here	94.44126438236627
7452. you don't want to	lease a place way out in the sticks	959.8070044764348
7453. you get business where the business	is not where it isn't	506.2864074055951
7454. i grinned at him handed him	a couple of dollars and said by the time you get the parking charge	figured up there should be a cigar in it for you	5005.252915432617
7455. i hurried	over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just	in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left	3105.4266079632685
7456. i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn	956.5740664778411
7457. by the time i'd	made it he was gone	259.09827393999467
7458. i turned on the	electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear	1420.1073125466924
7459. i made	time and picked him up within ten blocks	375.3432634606387
7460. i stayed half a block behind	him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady	beep h beep h beep	3678.1996486372855
7461. after fifteen minutes of traffic driving	he turned to the left	499.97075038506335
7462. i couldn't see him but the electric bugging	device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half	beeps when the car i was following was to the left and long drawn-out	beeps when it turned to the right	6335.84277476668
7463. if it ever got behind me the beep	turned to a buzz	643.3898659703751
7464. i turned left too soon and got a signal showing	that i was still behind him but he was to the right	3253.255395565129
7465. after a	while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me	1098.580908519659
7466. that meant	he'd parked someplace	22.12795394748847
7467. i made a big circle until i located the	car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house	1880.2018961732313
7468. i found	a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited	1655.5360721559093
7469. my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours	375.30982727600855
7470. then he came out	and started driving toward the beach	561.266094376714
7471. by this time it was dark	43.29689165955687
7472. i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop	far behind when there wasn't traffic	3031.4515574030274
7473. my lights would have been a	giveaway if i'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner	1418.8357666630761
7474. moreover	i'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing	device h	1649.4254607085957
7475. his signal was coming loud and clear and then all	of a sudden it turned to a buzz	1575.231962639576
7476. i circled the block and found he was	in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant	1892.7662204567227
7477. i sat where	i could watch the exit and realized i was hungry	792.2885833418079
7478. i sat there with	the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and	occasionally catching the aroma of coffee	2824.6286573311945
7479. my man came out an	hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went	to the swim and tan motel	2615.7018223737105
7480. it was a fairly modern motel with	quite a bit of electrical display in front	1644.6738795801189
7481. i remembered it was the	peeping tom place	167.6063910505854
7482. i waited until my man was coming out of	the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register	3480.0050475979706
7483. the card the man i was shadowing had filled out was still on the	counter	1091.8101350050126
7484. i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered	under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco	address	4283.684030010759
7485. he had written out the license number of his car	but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still	good	2458.543502124532
7486. ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't	check the license number on the plates against the license number the	tenant writes out	3901.1673990674403
7487. if he does it's still better than an even chance	he won't notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should	notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake	3671.0877873902564
7488. i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters	and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency	heap but a couple of phony numbers in between	5627.800064837347
7489. i could have	written anything	14.833556254561554
7490. the manager of the motel was a woman who apparently	didn't care	961.2630211074578
7491. she was complying with the law in regard to registrations	but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering	the tenants	2047.9530872416738
7492. you mean you're all alone mr richards	140.97250642394346
7493. that's right	0.20041515
7494. your wife isn't going	to join you- later	248.90576722485048
7495. i don't think so	2.965924380447892
7496. if	you expect her to show up she said you'd better put 'and	wife' on there	1879.8079568716644
7497. it's a formality you know	14.97854212998547
7498. any	difference in the rate	22.264952299460873
7499. i asked	0.20041515
7500. not to you she said	smiling	64.79582108481608
7501. it's ten dollars either way	14.774568911633773
7502. there are ice cubes in	a container at the far end and in another by the office	2122.8275482608974
7503. there are	three soft-drink vending machines and if you should be joined by- anybody-	try to keep things quiet if you will	2182.4192928960415
7504. we like to run a nice	quiet place	252.15098547996632
7505. thank you i told her	14.670157123145836
7506. i took	another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the	key to unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park	the car	5007.573120423289
7507. the construction was reasonably solid; not like	the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco	all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear	every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment	4467.44129588773
7508. i	put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted	to case	1885.1191953723894
7509. with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard	him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound	of water running	3090.7000745325067
7510. whoever his companion was going to be she	was going to join him later	1397.6289201817658
7511. she knew where to come	14.794953172377262
7512. he didn't have	to telephone	22.0982243805064
7513. i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of	communication had been severed	936.1584422061833
7514. it's one thing to go without food	when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing	a meal but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you	can't eat until he's bedded down for the night hunger can	be a gnawing torture	7033.594908901139
7515. i had noticed a drive-in down the road a	quarter of a mile	794.6136130103297
7516. the batteries on the bugging device i had put on	the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals	3262.9716584660123
7517. the	powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel	unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation	and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry	3844.344956443929
7518. i	got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers	with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service	possible	4485.006727654416
7519. the place wasn't particularly busy at that time	of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the	tightest-fitting pair of slacks i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater	that showed everything there was- and there was lots of it- wanted	to be sociable	5052.98426980675
7520. you really in a hurry handsome	65.97933249059402
7521. she asked	0.20041515
7522. i'm in a hurry beautiful	22.224962716368708
7523. it's	early in the evening to be in a hurry	375.1965305166742
7524. there's lots of time left	22.103954197911424
7525. there may not be any women left i said	259.83434822979484
7526. she gave	a little pout and said i don't get off work until eleven	o'clock	1648.0977162506665
7527. that's when my evening commences	14.82058515788313
7528. i'll	be here at ten-fifty-five i said	139.79719472764617
7529. that's what they all say	14.794050493856478
7530. what's that thing going	buzz-buzz-buzz in your car	249.8641001058733
7531. i said darn it that's	the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on	1261.2205135241172
7532. i didn't	turn it off	22.204097641280118
7533. i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging	device	378.7035593305538
7534. she went in to get the hamburgers and i switched	on the device again and kept the signal from dowling's car coming	in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the hamburgers	5661.657994846533
7535. then i shut off the device again	94.58532858085292
7536. she wanted to hang around	while i was eating	391.3369677021419
7537. don't you think it's selfish to have	dinner before you go to pick her up	1093.701990417506
7538. no i said	0.30041514999999996
7539. it's a kindness to her	14.694767572882057
7540. you see she's on a diet	65.48395732653232
7541. she'll	eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i'm to have one	with her so she won't feel out of place	2319.464634239913
7542. diets can be	terrible the girl said	141.64243179724735
7543. how much overweight is she	14.906820738596576
7544. not a bit i said but she's keeping her figure in hand	950.7996749894825
7545. she looked at me provocatively	14.69478554500947
7546. good figures should	be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated	wiggle	1877.674366051207

7577. as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull	her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair	that something bad had happened to lauren	3738.4167723026503

7600. with a curse	vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted	metal top and threw it against the wall opposite	3686.6549234177596
7601. the heavy glass	didn't break but the top flew off; sugar sprayed with a hiss	that was loud in the silence	2026.6005320776621

7750. there was	nothing he could do but walk	252.1876177550443
7751. and jarrodsville was more than three	miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire	2051.3467332489977
7752. marty faced east and started walking down the left side	of the road	1188.037736440235
7753. after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned	up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked	2324.1176820960623
7754. the viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across	the road and reflected the murky light	2605.188613658624
7755. as he approached	the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and	louder like a steadily advancing drum corps	2048.032696080262
7756. there were several people	on the porch of the farmhouse	564.0320629732294
7757. there was a very old man and a young	woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers	1897.5996060872603
7758. for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help	952.9775741030193
7759. perhaps	they had a car or truck and would drive him into town	802.4006708569356
7760. then he realized	the utter futility of the idea	391.41993293282053
7761. they were staring at him in the same	blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared	1883.3390810633314
7762. even	the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious	393.0084636341573
7763. on his	side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning	against a plow	1886.5030431155706
7764. they too stared at him	22.256536695846695
7765. the drums of	thunder were right behind him now	261.7215027287656
7766. a foolish thought came into	his head	141.94868580318877
7767. he remembered a story he had read as a youth	375.58129249225595
7768. it was probably	one of kipling's tales of the british army	756.6636448314432
7769. it concerned an officer	who had been disgraced and drummed out	502.02688655814734
7770. the steady roll of the drums	had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of	the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back	as the officer approached	5682.32737485912
7771. marty wished these poor farm people would	turn their backs	373.8028435582934
7772. the fencing by the roadside ended	65.28981279969466
7773. now the	dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch	too broad to leap over unless you were an olympic star	2724.7987998651124
7774. the day's	rain had been added to the stagnant water	563.3008745261351
7775. he was trapped on the	road when he heard the sound of an approaching car	1105.3423002722784
7776. it was coming toward	him	22.40933720130241
7777. the car was now in sight	43.66924804319654
7778. marty's heart skipped a beat when	he recognized it	390.1570887685964
7779. it was the station wagon that had passed his cab	on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm	2462.561071378007
7780. it had headed back toward jarrodsville	65.21681495053288
7781. that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road	946.2093330578131
7782. now acey and his friends were returning to seek him out	749.4178336742772
7783. the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of	him beside a fenced field	1883.8291813595254
7784. then there was another sound	22.179848504908808
7785. a second	car was coming from the west from the direction of sanford's run	949.8774889306624
7786. it was the ford that had been outside burch's farm	559.3575742358727
7787. marty	looked helplessly in both directions	43.62608183255509
7788. it was a narrow road barely	wide enough for two cars to pass	1179.3211795011175
7789. he could not leave the road because	of the water-filled drainage ditch	641.1075046934614
7790. when the two cars were equidistant	from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered	speed	2595.9436607673674
7791. they bore down on him	14.897944004184541
7792. there was nothing he could do except	jump into the ditch	761.6234080675097
7793. he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy	water	372.848080676525
7794. as the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie	nerve-shattering sound	1181.6032143157922
7795. marty knew how the union soldiers must	have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the	ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they	called the rebel yell	3544.0482865549434
7796. for moments he stood in water shivering	and gasping for breath	748.6991221879878
7797. he had turned his ankle slightly and it	pained him	373.797290922355
7798. the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared	in the distance	1184.0159496045842
7799. there had been two more cars parked at the farm	a plymouth and a pickup truck	1267.028346543054
7800. they would be coming for him next bearing	down on him from both directions	1423.8754719098542
7801. and then the station wagon and	the ford would seek him out again	787.7333489113514
7802. he would be harassed repeatedly	and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville	2574.0317448464675
7803. he still had three miles to go	94.00293209027038
7804. back east the more affluent	juvenile delinquents who could afford hyped-up autos instead of	switch blades as lethal weapons played this same game and called it	chicken	4283.429868198645
7805. he could not go through the fields	94.3736565248899
7806. that way	was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence	1660.2804968357734
7807. he	had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the	rail fence the section by the farmhouse	2321.2695273358195
7808. at least he could climb	up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again	1647.081656708266
7809. the admassy place	could not be far now	166.71413201036475
7810. he would go in there climb through the window	and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest	3252.7666573972374
7811. there	was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected	788.8710568796189
7812. he did not dare climb back up to the road	564.4880912173313
7813. he was deep in water but	at least they could not reach him there	936.7011222678626
7814. he splashed on mud sucking	at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage	ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm	4832.416193025404
7815. he climbed	back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted	505.3153805746862
7816. he stood panting	for a moment	65.03222192496638
7817. and then he saw something that he had not seen before	and panic gripped him again	1260.4323400497074
7818. the fence his only refuge when	the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right	but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that	would rip his flesh if he pressed against it	6423.298623748752
7819. he lurched on down the	road despairingly because there was no place else to go	1104.5711814540498
7820. he lost	all sense of dignity	65.33301992566922
7821. you could not stand on dignity when you were	soaked and muddied and your life was at stake	1566.9467526899568
7822. probably people were	watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse	too but he did not bother to look	3703.2985925455746
7823. he broke into a dogtrot breathing	heavily streaming with sweat	378.8144343906768
7824. he had to reach admassy's place	65.66634242929817
7825. it was his only sanctuary	14.97525878174432
7826. the fences on both sides of the road	bristled with the barbed wire	1179.7288211340879
7827. the fences stretched on endlessly	14.81870803575483
7828. and then he heard them	22.111538025232754
7829. and now he saw them	14.777666714290785
7830. the	plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west	1668.68991791722
7831. they had timed it better this time	92.95443084072427
7832. they would reach him at almost	exactly the same instant	560.0215604442545
7833. if he backed	against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he	would be cruelly lacerated by the wire	2606.621720201065
7834. he stumbled to the middle	of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect	target	2355.619021512833
7835. the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to	the floor boards	944.2044608569659
7836. they were coming on at reckless speed for such old	vehicles	750.2906147220872
7837. he held his arms close to his sides	and made himself as small as possible	1099.3049524531868
7838. when the plymouth neared it	veered toward him and seemed about to run him down	1650.1764144660665
7839. he forced himself	to stay frozen there	93.59317838357597
7840. if he moved he would be in the path of the	other car	1187.3423395104514
7841. he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket	as it went by	935.0135290112536
7842. in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by	on the other side	1650.2660191434675
7843. the weird insane sound of the rebel yell	reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills	1262.8016966934701
7844. he did not	leave the middle of the road	393.54863858512306
7845. he did not try to run	43.199838379706236
7846. he trudged on	his aching eyes focused straight ahead	395.44509198330167
7847. he was nearing the admassy	house	43.79103874814107
7848. he was going to make it he told himself	387.0298245477403
7849. and then he heard	a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and	weep	2050.120409947001
7850. oh no not again he said aloud	140.58747653381647
7851. there was a new sound a sound as piercing as the rebel	yell yet different	1102.875068170456
7852. it was the sound of a siren	140.47103944002194
7853. now he saw that	the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms	frantically	1573.5948896173882
7854. it was the prowl car from the sheriff's office	395.79878325619194
7855. the car drew up alongside him and stopped	167.68290351617011
7856. get in	charley estes said brusquely	64.9338800167474
7857. he staggered into the back seat	and lay back fighting for breath	643.7486349498693
7858. there was someone in front with	the sheriff	251.77737714934338
7859. it was pete holmes the cabdriver	43.60684669903329
7860. pete turned	around and said to marty i guess you think i'm a yellow-bellied	hound	1642.7373637266214
7861. but there wasn't no use in me staying there	259.7026739154825
7862. i couldn't	fight a dozen or so of 'em	395.18371530141087
7863. if i'd stayed all that i'd have	got was four punctured tires and one busted head	1257.1030746157048
7864. why didn't you	wait at the burch house	251.36634135908213
7865. you must've known i'd gone to get	the sheriff	260.1442143693606
7866. i was lucky they let me go i guess	390.7434113430342
7867. the sheriff	was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space	949.731584008041
7868. when it was finally pointed east he said you should never have	come out here alone	1883.5444749145295
7869. every man in every	one of these houses is a night rider	650.9584828000196
7870. then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the	bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes	3278.8460283318427
7871. rourke was	talking on the phone when he came back	376.74347329986284
7872. about an hour eh	4.452036495617838
7873. are	you positive	0.20041515
7874. he listened a moment and then said hold it	390.4891026464576
7875. he turned his head and said alvarez will definitely be in a back	room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour	2618.0222477428188
7876. want	to try and meet him there	141.39675262943032
7877. shayne looked at his watch	14.7912192592417
7878. that	wasn't too far from fifth street and should allow him to make	scotty's bar by midnight	2132.604160671298
7879. he said with satisfaction that's	fine tim	94.83760344926019
7880. rourke confirmed the appointment	over the phone and hung up	565.0438110476532
7881. i don't know what you're getting	into mike he said unhappily	499.50127565599195
7882. i hope to christ h	22.384742695951818
7883. shayne said briskly grab another drink if you want it	373.2869285763162
7884. we've	got one other call to make before i meet alvarez	748.907403960199
7885. where	0.20041515
7886. it's out in the northeast section	65.44798970938709
7887. have	you got my car here	43.69575761130849
7888. it's parked in front	4.4396040481595085
7889. rourke	hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes	639.3096098614427
7890. i'd better keep on driving yours shayne decided	because i'll be going on over to the beach	2111.827712141348
7891. i can drop you back	here to pick mine up	374.9843922406088
7892. he went to a closet to get a light jacket	and took his hat from beside the door	2370.921915709582
7893. timothy rourke gulped down	the whiskey hastily and joined him asking who are we going to call	on in the northeast section	2176.0214001352188
7894. a lady	0.30041514999999996
7895. that is maybe	not too much of a lady	260.7496659586147
7896. at least i want to find out whether she's	home yet or not	1173.622365411886
7897. he opened the door and followed rourke out	165.6618072253902
7898. in rourke's car shayne drove east to biscayne boulevard	and north toward felice perrin's address which had been given to	him by the peralta governess	3905.1017200912356
7899. as he drove he filled in timothy rourke	briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter	to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises	3239.994030752933
7900. i want	to be in scotty's bar at midnight when marsha makes her phone call	there he ended grimly	2574.4818021300066
7901. i don't know whether that threatening	letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but	i want to see who takes the call	2846.004137818092
7902. this deal at las	putas buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said rourke with	interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought	by the luscious mrs peralta doesn't it	5332.139966838283
7903. it	does shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his	in	the green jungle parking lot	1724.3517980615718
7904. that story of hers about an unsigned	note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony	2127.32988391589
7905. if	it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written	before peralta ever called me in on the case	2713.144214637909
7906. do	you think laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's	knowledge	1401.8401479990782
7907. i haven't the faintest idea	14.842468116279756
7908. i	think her husband strongly suspects so and that's why he called me	in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates h and almost	certainly without telling them why he was doing so	5634.7768070998245
7909. isn't this felice's	street	2.974051328094512
7910. shayne asked peering ahead at the partially	obscured street sign	564.2135700639637
7911. rourke could see it better out the right-hand	side and he said yes	788.3578641943495
7912. turn to the left i think for that	number you gave me	954.048733675977
7913. not more than a block or so	95.09584392568122
7914. shayne	got in the left-hand lane and cut across the boulevard divider	966.9287220254928
7915. there	was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast	corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined	street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story	mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments	4644.859135516746
7916. shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke	crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers	2834.426837136155
7917. a single	automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side	788.4736350560079
7918. shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he	approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they	passed indicating that it was occupied	5320.876985738854
7919. he turned to see	the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke	said it's the next house mike	2324.516289788009
7920. instead	of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to	the corner where he swung left	2369.741713519774
7921. he went around the corner and parked	turning off his lights and motor	791.3678628258332
7922. i told you mike said	rourke in an aggrieved voice	563.3047786376804
7923. it was back there h	14.863512458670845
7924. shayne said i know it was tim	140.3743567546049
7925. his voice was chilling and	cold	43.59580621481173
7926. did you see the car parked across the street	393.73603117949517
7927. i didn't notice it	2.934656529649969
7928. i was watching for numbers h	65.31254952056659
7929. it	has a beach license tim	43.82880418382418
7930. two men in the front seat	65.26592337891297
7931. i got a	quick look at their faces as we went past	642.7914025658238
7932. unless i'm crazy as hell	they're two of painter's dicks	564.8972440905216
7933. a couple named harris and geely	44.04402218486599
7934. those names mean anything to you	65.41947554801585
7935. wait a minute	mike	2.9641520213919237
7936. in painter's office this evening h	65.41034782249302
7937. the pair whom petey is officially commending for	slapping me around and pulling me in	1091.7248767097333
7938. what are they doing	here	22.382361257887435
7939. a stake-out i suppose	2.931139490566623
7940. maybe with specific orders to see that i don't make contact with her	1177.931914555765
7941. i may be wrong	2.9762983683517197
7942. i'll slide out and	walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on biscayne	1659.535057191721
7943. you drive	on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there	784.2516074626012
7944. you're	a reporter and you're looking for miss perrin to interview her	957.3672275291095
7945. make them show their hands	14.82447321959082
7946. if they are beach cops on a stake-out	they'll admit it to a reporter	1419.6592274012048
7947. they've got no official standing	on this side of the bay	500.9435725076129
7948. as soon as you find out if they are geely	and harris come on around to the lounge where i'll be waiting	3274.426141206371
7949. shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out	372.42303290643247
7950. timothy	rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel	563.3371239044328
7951. the things you	talk me into mike h	167.90469275759497
7952. how often	do they add up to headlines	247.90257151362525
7953. you should complain	0.20041515
7954. he crossed	the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard	and north a block to the open restaurant	3287.3315577544113
7955. he was standing	at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came	in six or eight minutes later	2318.0727728867205
7956. the reporter nodded as he moved up beside	him at the bar	967.11266146508

7958. i made them show me their identification before i could be	persuaded not to call on felice perrin	2359.7737039019867
7959. shayne said happily	i've got it all worked out tim	373.41299374592415
7960. take your time with your	drink	65.09375144780157
7961. in exactly three minutes go in that phone	booth behind you and call police headquarters	1098.76719638235
7962. be excited and don't	identify yourself	65.60752124883051
7963. just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell	of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car	2474.3927602227677
7964. then	hang up fast and come walking on down to the perrin address	1185.1637123485423
7965. i'll	be waiting for you there	43.49512234823376
7966. the bartender brought rourke's	drink and shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar	1409.7732637136692
7967. he said in	a low voice i've got a date with a lady mister	953.8063058370126
7968. will that	pay for a pint i can take with me	750.3507306294741
7969. you know how it is he added with	a conspiratorial wink	504.0498142065464
7970. candy is dandy but liquor is quicker h	and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow	2359.425522446489
7971. the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill	374.2438632568247
7972. he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in	a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne	4083.1318929266586
7973. as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what	in hell are you going to do mike	1883.3177773934065
7974. make a couple of	punk detectives named geely and harris wish to god they'd stayed	out of my way this afternoon	3025.4300672499053
7975. shayne	strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink	getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police	2599.105415088983
7976. outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his	coupe directly in front of the bar headed south	2816.1072346934498
7977. he walked over to	the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of	the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket	2733.3335548348336
7978. he hoped he wouldn't	be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but	its weight was comforting at his hip	3675.3360960039827
7979. on this side of the bay miami	beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and	shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs	3003.190161897883
7980. he went	swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives	in the front seat	2596.9823383548674
7981. he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached	stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around	to the right-hand side	2880.912816738348
7982. the big paunchy man named geely	was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced	companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door	4469.663223521386
7983. shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either	of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night	2320.194010365451
7984. geely	grunted and slid partly out and shayne's left arm snaked in around	his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway	and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before geely could	straighten up	6449.730009690613
7985. shayne stepped back to let him slump to the	ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who	was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster	somewhat impeded by the steering wheel	4320.5252422956055
7986. shayne locked his big	hands around harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into	the roadway	2596.5867168283703
7987. he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt	the body go limp	1417.6435469219646
7988. he dropped him into the street a couple of feet	away from geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them	for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side	5504.530121431013
7989. they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didn't	think either of them had recognized him or could describe him	2029.5078854714818
7990. he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the	top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed	the open bottle in on the front seat	5340.293799412849
7991. he turned then to	look toward the lighted boulevard and saw rourke's tall emaciated	figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the	street toward the opposite side	3463.0234515780357
7992. shayne strolled across to intercept	the reporter in front of the two-story house where felice perrin	lived and asked casually get the police okay	3703.357288251738
7993. sure	0.20041515
7994. said they'd have a patrol car here fast	251.6413435173591
7995. what happened with you	2.977635447596268
7996. why the two damned fools	got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out	cold shayne said good-humoredly	3258.5285740002078
7997. they'll have fun explaining	that to the miami cops	262.6724141644139
7998. got no business over here on a stake-out anyway	395.07136415126763
7999. they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway	where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling	2054.5912642739286
8000. a row of mailboxes	along the wall had numbers and names on them	1186.6734212996378
8001. shayne found one marked	perrin 2-a	43.8947039664955
8002. the stairway on the right was dark but	there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb	at the top and they went up	4274.217251506084
8003. there were two front rooms both	dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire	house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake	3218.0029983159793
8004. eight nine steps above him roberts had paused	251.89556977298398
8005. mickey paused	with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out	do a little planning	1571.4642771185038
8006. he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk	with the telephone and pen set	1896.8685164791118
8007. if i could call in they	could check the story while we were on our way	1245.929096118087
8008. i wouldn't have to	tell them i had roberts-   then he heard it like a muffled	thud felt a subtle change in air pressure	3676.139922095681
8009. he glanced up in time to	see roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through	the air his bloody face twisted	2320.258436240671
8010. mickey tried to flatten against the	banister gripped it with one hand but roberts' full weight struck	him at that moment in the groin	3686.6689812018158
8011. he gasped for air and the impact	tore	his hand from the rail	792.6661898708041
8012. he tumbled with roberts helpless and in	agony over and over down the steps	1423.8105815027413
8013. by a wrenching effort	he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and	shoulders rather than his head	2595.49972269589
8014. he was fuzzy in his mind and for a	moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of	the weight of roberts' body	4297.814319509892
8015. when his vision cleared he saw the taller	one scrambling upward reaching	649.7861040747365
8016. mickey was on his knees when roberts	turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand	2357.305466587848
8017. he felt	his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon	at hand	1261.7471681127631
8018. mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet which	would first betray the moment and direction of an attack	2356.9387429707185
8019. he rose stiffly	forcing his knees to lock	166.17504047636436
8020. the knifelike pain in his groin nearly	brought him down again	753.0059109949464
8021. he made himself back off slowly his eyes	wary on roberts who now had no more to lose than he	1891.2536028351612
8022. the pain dulled	as he moved and he steadied inside	564.727989822951
8023. after a moment he extended one	hand the fingers curled	374.03245294108643
8024. you want	to be that big a fool- i was hoping for this	1178.3488932324944
8025. roberts	brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps	946.3860962862512
8026. he	held the razor well out to one side	390.5135854046033
8027. he was invulnerable to attack	but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make	the first move	2170.0967616233793
8028. they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared	the last step	757.1422002022788
8029. mickey waited with slack arms	14.79742879302039
8030. any time	roberts he said	22.189643826883902
8031. or would it be easier if i put my hands in	my pockets	789.0393627995401
8032. the taunt was lost on roberts	64.85091351824576
8033. he advanced	slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side	785.5099754571985
8034. he was	just short of arm's reach when he stopped	557.2403830220568
8035. mickey backed off two steps	forcing him to come on again	502.98341649385327
8036. there was a fixed grin on roberts'	face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood	2360.672919917365
8037. mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along	373.91427764174
8038. they moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a macabre dance-	two steps back two steps forward two steps back	3293.67342387798
8039. mickey felt his shoulders	come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door	1097.1887901385594
8040. this	was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was	to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should	feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern	6807.605806354104
8041. the kick came sudden and vicious but short	166.37392751119359
8042. mickey's	guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon	1421.0553564765926
8043. it	moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward	641.466578277268
8044. he hunched	his left shoulder into it and slashed at roberts' forearm with	his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve	3265.7466002279807
8045. before roberts could	move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into	roberts' belly	1721.464007643942
8046. roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly	141.14825305309225
8047. ducking	mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood	floor	944.2793902426052
8048. then roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple	of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade	2809.1618629962604
8049. he felt it rip at the side	of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs	1573.1624980201846
8050. he got a	knee up into roberts' belly used both hands and heaved him clear	then scrambled to his feet	2826.7162060401038
8051. they were in the center of the lobby now	262.275269244628
8052. still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking	his head	1184.056533328204
8053. when he charged mickey was ready	43.23276433014474
8054. he hit roberts with his	left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled	in mid-air	3051.98281160436
8055. with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind	it he smashed at the bloodstained face	1415.321460093217
8056. roberts careened backward	his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against	the newel post at the foot of the stairs	3275.0032822116927
8057. the sound of his head striking	the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound	947.1871237939922
8058. he fell on	his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still	1641.1252842050471
8059. mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands	panting for breath	785.9853550197628
8060. after a minute he went to roberts looked at one	of his eyes and felt for a pulse	2362.275463291274
8061. roberts appeared	to be dead; if not yet then soon very soon	637.4860935162926
8062. suddenly it was	cold in the lobby	140.07885309433115
8063. it seemed to him that a long time	had passed before he decided what to do	1255.933533642726
8064. actually it was no more than	eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this:	there's no way to take him in now and keep those other two-	wister and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about	roberts and lamming out	7411.502044528572
8065. the local law here would hold me till they	check clear back home and maybe more than that	1576.516088551279
8066. by then they could never catch up with the others	565.4363342455641
8067. there's no other	way; i'll have to do it myself	373.8617494609238
8068. he looked at where roberts	lay sprawled on the step	564.1924915985219
8069. mickey was sure now he was dead	94.06579812693693
8070. one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet	391.33288695257943
8071. he climbed the stairs went into roberts' room found a suitcase	and	packed as much into it as he could	1893.1839019123968
8072. he left a few things	22.13575877935976
8073. it didn't	have to be perfect	43.17817743660429
8074. walking away on impulse	he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry	1631.1408467860267
8075. when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about	the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched	2192.5976161943486
8076. it took	him nearly an hour	65.84160782355637
8077. he went to the room he had rented and got into	his overcoat	794.4712381542046
8078. he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby	955.3818253869509
8079. he set roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and	walked back to the garage	1261.591381850629
8080. he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing	388.52891221095024
8081. it snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision	against the night sky	947.2260052231732
8082. he could feel it on his face and in his	hair	751.932055027801
8083. he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed	it up for five minutes	1411.1497921793518
8084. then he backed out and swung around to the front	drive	756.9154708523462
8085. he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor	647.0020762838558
8086. he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping	394.4498048764931
8087. he took the suitcase	out to the jeep and put it in the front seat	1096.0585848825826
8088. then he went back for	roberts	65.24002864212801
8089. the body was heavier than he had anticipated	168.6328001014636
8090. he	got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down	to the jeep	2367.035004079536
8091. he dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't	roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making	sure it was unlocked	2981.989772250569
8092. he drove carefully in the direction	of the brief tour they had taken earlier	1412.9292866111562
8093. it snowed continuously but	quietly evenly	43.36196704104675
8094. when he reached the dip in the woods he saw that	already the earlier ruts were barely discernible	2354.2272033874997
8095. the jeep fought its	way through the low spot and got onto higher ground	939.4665416745056
8096. he drove in low	gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance	to the abandoned mine	3708.6314660922594
8097. he parked facing it and left the headlights	on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found	the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the	passage	3673.8204925328328
8098. he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel	and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier	3911.282188514914
8099. he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around	it	1111.021208021022
8100. when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully	worked roberts' body onto his shoulder	2367.6047460451573
8101. it wasn't like carrying	the suitcase	43.83489250491936
8102. the soft snow was deceitful underfoot	64.81033167660966
8103. inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen	timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden	1887.3030570448796
8104. by the time	he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back	ached under the drag of the dead weight	4114.435609964368
8105. he stood looking down	for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge	1573.207389499212
8106. there was too much weight casually to toss it away	559.6210418620587
8107. he could feel	himself falling in with it and being unable to get out	931.1881674514214
8108. it would be	a bad place to die	251.7748493666224
8109. it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but	roberts had asked for it	1254.6099252015417
8110. it was too late to worry about that	249.27416824376624
8111. he knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel	793.9208940932889
8112. it was a relief to get rid of the weight	559.2875464862444
8113. he was shaking with tension	and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down	1871.734596949429
8114. then he got on his knees and rolled roberts' body toward the edge	1186.4871283880816
8115. it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off	261.21017532436974
8116. he gave it a	strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole	1648.6392164839708
8117. he got	to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit	793.3460641685348
8118. the body lay	in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel	floor	2358.0790807738404
8119. there was little chance	anyone would enter this shaft during the winter	636.5704101298495
8120. the external signs of	his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next	day	2588.5281425275166
8121. it wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact	639.3570506572192
8122. by spring it would be a skeleton	141.7048841355092
8123. he made his way back to	the jeep	166.93699114745806
8124. he had started to back into the turn when he remembered	the razor in his pocket	1893.202918444024
8125. he climbed down went back into the tunnel and	tossed the razor into the pit	1109.0821469536918
8126. it landed on roberts' sprawled right	thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground	1646.3782507566139
8127. he went	back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel	1265.3953574532447
8128. in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had	made of it	2119.5680659248364
8129. there were stains here and there and he cleaned them off	using an oiled rag he found on a nail	1894.6342835888022
8130. he wiped the steering wheel	and all the places he might have touched the jeep	1647.1933110966202
8131. he replaced the	flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it	out of the garage	2035.1653918962809
8132. there were tire marks where it had been but they	were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable	except under close scrutiny	4282.075652008602
8133. liz peabody he thought might spend	some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would	launch an investigation	2166.279607415784
8134. he judged her to be a woman of some pride	though not much sense	1414.5471753891902
8135. still she would probably have sense enough not	to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently	had run away	2449.1904967139103
8136. he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room	758.1757874741666
8137. the maid	answered and he decided nancy must be at work	502.39176329929234
8138. jeb cautioned	him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly	but it does sound good	3040.722875822289
8139. a woman named lisa who tells nobody	anything about herself	375.24350383241074
8140. that courtyard picture with the same initials	141.10588029294135
8141. i'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm	262.3572994129607
8142. i'll call you in a day or so	252.59457121208848
8143. on the highway he relaxed	and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast	1269.9084018365263
8144. gulf springs was ten miles inland- more of a quaint old	coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions	3481.1373462224137
8145. he checked into a motel and drove downtown	167.94674337295362
8146. the courthouse	was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome	560.0304529400472
8147. instead of the	usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town	squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of	camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green	shade of florist's grass	4210.580247043931
8148. he figured his best bet was a call	on the sheriff	757.9224079698943
8149. a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff	carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with	a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher	office	3869.532532526306
8150. seated in front of the desk hank said i'm	looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff	2820.942657368503
8151. he explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous	clue which had brought him to gulf springs	1733.4341571918662
8152. the sheriff's	swivel chair tilted back	65.37010514676086
8153. so you're looking for a woman who married	a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned	2313.152987826904
8154. if there was such a person i'm afraid she got away with	it	1182.467822185957
8155. pity we don't know more about him	94.82466532995286
8156. i think the best bet is to	go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms	match with the obituaries a little later	4658.639937666951
8157. it'll be a tedious job	but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement	here in the county supervisor's office	2731.8285561419957
8158. maybe the society	editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride	568.4041891226739
8159. mrs calhoun has been society editor here	for twenty-five years	375.068923177958
8160. the editor says that marriages may be made in	heaven but weddings are made in mrs calhoun's columns	2351.342635929258
8161. she's	the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday	paper and all that	1876.1609069112542
8162. once when the editor was	just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation mrs calhoun	and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out	beside his bed	5474.344298007064
8163. she'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about	background	636.9409935046301
8164. she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking	down heredity and environment	1186.934462131485
8165. she'd also remember if the groom	died later	167.65452151355075
8166. i wish you good luck but please don't	dig up too tough a case for me this close to election	2808.1647376399083
8167. if you	find out anything come on back here and we'll get started on it	1093.3941937455893
8168. tracking down mrs calhoun was like trying to catch up with	paul revere between lexington and concord	2124.8168572004806
8169. it turned out that	she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance	792.9844788452384
8170. the wearying	trek stretched into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance	office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found	her at five o'clock	4486.514136189757
8171. she was a large woman with a frizzled gray	poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while	she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter	3221.598339330165
8172. it took a couple of minutes	to run through her various	businesses and get down to the one he wanted	2808.3863737394217
8173. last year	0.20041515
8174. well i do remember one	22.46104742473353
8175. married a man named vincent black	43.62269103787294
8176. i remember her because	she didn't want her picture in the paper	956.6998153530619
8177. first bride like that i've	seen in twenty-five years	263.2460503407502
8178. what reason did she give	22.324434549654647
8179. said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort	of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough	2022.0306539773196
8180. i didn't	see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked	like it had never had a	blemish on it	3694.787944973469
8181. but of course you couldn't	see too well through the veil	506.0878688913789
8182. was her name lisa carmody	22.555315892751786
8183. now how in hell would i remember that	167.77078579548782
8184. never mind	0.30041514999999996
8185. i can look it up	14.742379451762579
8186. do they still live here	22.28034915983959
8187. i think they moved away shortly after they were married	371.1745035965097
8188. he	was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred	1184.808947433365
8189. i'm sure it'll be in the files	93.63065148252467
8190. we usually run a social note when	somebody moves away	561.7955926300862
8191. he stood up and thanked her	43.411940404519726
8192. have	they inherited some money or something	141.8382599744063
8193. she asked with a	reportorial gleam in her eye	260.4672485592388
8194. he said vaguely well it is	a little legal matter but nothing like that	1409.9362659906951
8195. he hurried across	to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving	1111.2387197285987
8196. sounds like what you're after he said when hank had	finished	755.7333242275132
8197. come on let's hurry down before they lock up for the	day	643.4048532874206
8198. in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy	office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves	3497.5082355271406
8199. mr ferrell h hirey lindsay chairman of the board	of supervisors	499.6149206160209
8200. mr ferrell is a private detective hirey	142.60497921142203
8201. wants	to look up something in the newspaper files so don't lock him	in here	1098.8452081232624
8202. i'll just leave the	door open	65.3490275213326
8203. it latches when you close it so stay as long as you like	797.7905010925958
8204. carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open	grillework in the top half	1886.3456060799992
8205. now don't shut this	door	14.72215659277517
8206. it won't open from inside	22.29896909931171
8207. before we built the new jail	we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail	got too crowded	2179.8513691416492
8208. hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners	560.3416421100917
8209. they were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with	the cold air from hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille	2475.141087541586
8210. he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with	shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all	around the walls	3703.8554482082727
8211. a metal table and four chairs stood in the center	375.72702246667757
8212. they're all here back to 1865 carruthers told him	389.44703058386483
8213. it's all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out	before you leave	1089.337541041436
8214. and of course you know not to take clippings	390.4514372828469
8215. i'll leave the air conditioner on for you mr ferrell	said hirey	642.753515409608
8216. don't forget to turn it off and close the door	good so it'll latch	1409.4469643137709
8217. hank thanked them and promised to	observe the rules	261.56272055868124
8218. when they had gone he stood for a minute breathing	in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming	air conditioner couldn't quite dispel	4288.699000946346
8219. in	a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on	the left and progressed clockwise around the room	2189.3542735131887
8220. an old weakness for	burrowing in records rose up to tempt him	957.087554221173
8221. it was indeed	all here- almost a century	167.733221199949
8222. from reconstruction to moon rockets	22.1903359395246
8223. but	he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to	the newer ones	1264.2858805064966
8224. last year's volume was at the top a couple	of inches below the ceiling	1410.2452371275472
8225. near it was a metal ladder on casters attached	to the top shelf	793.6094316479836
8226. he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out	the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it	3056.9489006434396
8227. he	staggered over and dropped it on the table	261.0653439888256
8228. since mrs calhoun	remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started	to plod through several months	2832.567755361118
8229. he tried to turn right to the society	page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract	him	2029.9314508454736
8230. at last he found it in the paper of april 2	749.2400749073646
8231. it	told him little more than mrs calhoun had remembered stating that	it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others	2604.1128081360666
8232. there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride	and groom	1406.0630351628513
8233. mr black's life was an open book so to speak from	his birth in jackson mississippi through his basketball-playing	days at lsu and his attainment of a ba degree which	had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager	for peerless business machines	4615.2252376294255
8234. the one line on the bride	said she was miss lisa carmody from baton rouge	1660.1241859482702
8235. no mention of	new orleans	14.79561112042212
8236. hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for	mr black	560.7978588310498
8237. if mrs black was who he thought she was mr black's	peerless selling days might well be over	1560.2940248157356
8238. now for their	exodus from gulf springs	141.86577380633278
8239. this time the search took twice as long	cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several	columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue	3337.9120076702566
8240. he found	it in the edition of may 15	390.9624464588389
8241. the item said mr and mrs black	had moved to jackson his home town- so the lovely lisa had been	with him a year ago	2614.1937964557123
8242. next on his program was a call to the jackson	office of peerless business machines to find out if vincent	black was still with them- or more specifically still with us	4980.006586327675
8243. he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided	to indulge his weakness now	1415.835157313157
8244. for the next hour he scrambled happily	up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen	mckinley's assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago	and the hall-mills trial	5197.177096547721
8245. in the middle of the stock market	crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office	1425.4846303098852
8246. he turned around	saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse	962.9321941875791
8247. something else distracted	him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence	643.599185186074
8248. then he knew	it was not sound but lack of it	743.6429872199727
8249. the air conditioner was no longer	running	93.47004913210199
8250. he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door	closing	963.0127733879954
8251. it clanged shut as he sprang toward it	168.11881818069963
8252. he pressed	his face against the grille	141.65351196473551
8253. who's there	0.20041515
8254. the light	shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond- enough	for him to see there was no one there	3046.22477243356
8255. then he heard the outer door	closing	93.75599224253111
8256. hey come back he shouted	22.216401428517848
8257. he thought it must	be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring	that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock	hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind	3971.0316320625107
8258. unless	he was stone-blind the person who'd just left couldn't have missed	seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room	3491.204420686166
8259. and	even if he'd somehow missed seeing him he wouldn't have gone off	and left the light on and door open in the file room	2613.7397705246162
8260. whoever	it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited	till the courthouse and square were deserted	3489.5827298816666
8261. but why	0.20041515
8262. to search	his room at the motel	141.11981773003907
8263. to come back later and kill him after the stores	had closed around the square and everybody had left	1744.5970044322385
8264. no they	could	kill him just as easy right now	569.5566203867838
8265. nobody could hear what was going	on in this underground vault	498.91045307482756
8266. then he heard it and smelled it-	the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping	2124.089817466217
8267. it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the	supervisors' office	1262.925341571035
8268. until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley	had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace	and choosing	3287.974980376211
8269. except for those minutes in her room he had	lost touch with her as a reality	1255.8787470987895
8270. gaylor's obsession and cunningham's	chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking	of lila and lilac separately or together as a legend	3061.5741855001465
8271. they kept drifting	apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life	on a microscope slide	1890.2626908304815
8272. i take a little time to	think it over	390.26059947037925
8273. it was awkward: very awkward	14.821435875552472
8274. there would be all	the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over	1176.4790108579455
8275. and angie would hear about it	43.616809276380714
8276. and angie knew-	time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at	mr skyros	1882.3294476010367
8277. not too much time because i'll be needing some	more myself pretty much right away	1101.6522875153892
8278. and i done favors for you big	favor not so long back didn't i and i'm right here to take on	where pretty left off	3900.079212677168
8279. i don't want no trouble you	don't want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr skyros	1096.7900171717806
8280. dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another	man came in	1175.955880544197
8281. he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand;	the genial smile seemed painted on his face	1734.1703338162356
8282. angie knew- speak	of dangerous information! angie knew too much entirely already	946.8877164764165
8283. really	he had mr skyros at bay h   big favor i done	you	797.7318957104251
8284. acourse there's this deal o' denny's- and jackie's-	kinda hangin' fire ain't it maybe you've been kinda worryin'	over that	2824.7620365874222
8285. and can't say i blame you said angie thoughtfully	261.7693032306039
8286. this deal with the ace o' spades	140.83552950809226
8287. anything to do with an ace	o' spades bad luck	375.2334112175346
8288. ace of spades- a widow that was	what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered mr skyros	distractedly	2593.415428708836
8289. all about that angie knew too	43.179531520596285
8290. when things got	a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand- it seemed	to be a general rule	3660.5790219850787
8291. all just by chance and in a way tracing	back to poor frank all of it because naturally- brothers living	together- and angie-   mr skyros did not at all like the	look on angelo's regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking	face-	or indeed anything about angelo	4527.959176473473
8292. mr skyros was not a man	who thought very much about moral principles; he found money much more	interesting; but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way	in which angelo earned his living- and paid for his own stuff-	and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a	little ill	8131.256983966239
8293. look my friend he said in my life i	learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a	pound of cure	2723.3620816489447
8294. i stay in business so long because i'm careful	392.7879237479104
8295. two	weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens	meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal	isn't it	3338.520148245539
8296. that's a long while said angie	64.35746930152445
8297. i tell you you want to leave it that way i don't fool around	with it	1244.793556907479
8298. i go over to castro and get fixed up there	557.5270199204741
8299. i can't wait	no two weeks	43.395964069404016
8300. and mr skyros didn't like angie but	what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely	to come out- and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said-	all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a	whole new bunch of boys- why did everything have to happen at once	7830.842014410251
8301. denny said stupidly why you ain't turning angie down	are you mr skyros	790.5761201789364
8302. i mean we all figured- i guess anybody'd	figure- angie-   angelo gave him an affectionate	smile	1875.7653496530052
8303. mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me	he said	932.3131441899292
8304. it's ok denny everything's ok ain't	it mr skyros	391.5712680634144
8305. oh god the name repeated over	and over anybody to hear- not being a fool mr skyros knew	why	1732.3741944089124
8306. but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant	to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually	held- you could say- the whip hand	4647.415779929245
8307. and all because of domokous!	if mr skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would	eventually cause-   of course there was another factor	2724.9181211049313
8308. angie	worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes	went down fast	1885.414911706181
8309. who knew angie might not last long h	166.7641238509071
8310. the sweat broke out on mr skyros' forehead as he realized he had	been actually thinking- hoping- planning- perhaps-   good	god above had not domokous been enough	4287.255222804417
8311. he patted angelo's	thin shoulder paternally	43.698278606019635
8312. now you don't want to go talking	that way he said	749.1384183063144
8313. sure sure you're the one take over	for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isn't	it	2030.940811670534
8314. you don't need worry angelo	22.102828261186154
8315. i tell you i know how it is	with you my friend i sympathize and i'll make it a special point-	a special favor- get in touch and get some stuff just for you	3666.767987054057
8316. i don't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but i'll try	my best my friend	2358.9892019803037
8317. you see you got to remember we all got schedules	like any business! my man he won't be around a little while	he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the elite	3846.6002073580503
8318. it's	awkward you see that isn't it	140.62208492610344
8319. well that's	your business mr skyros said angie and his dreamy eyes	moved past mr skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass	window	2470.8185137758564
8320. i appreciate it you do that	65.6593954650514
8321. we don't none	of us want no trouble h	260.1166459902001
8322. i'm in a room over the golden club on	san pedro you just ask for me there you want see me	3057.858419960008
8323. or maybe i	call you- tonight	43.878403662366125
8324. about nine o'clock i call and see if you	got any	756.3500333438678
8325. a couple decks for me mr skyros- and ten-twelve to sell	see i like to have a little ready cash	1878.3434570798017
8326. oh now	i don't know about that much said mr skyros	750.6820995944584
8327. and you know	angelo pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they	say-   sure said angie	1719.6452432112505
8328. fifty a throw that the deal	65.32218866202425
8329. sure	0.20041515
8330. i bring you the cash say five	hundred for ten decks	750.0291112529915
8331. never mind how much i cut it how much i	get and he smiled his sleepy smile again	1560.8542616483123
8332. you go 'n' have a look round for it	392.51276840480693
8333. i	do my best said mr skyros earnestly just for you my friend	790.849675488562
8334. this is awkward for everybody isn't it we all got to put up with	inconvenience sometimes	1878.6272112240695
8335. but i do my best for you	94.49889327405654
8336. he got out	of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping	his brow	2348.291411549168
8337. the expedient thing- yes very true one must make	do as one could in some situations	1271.6700104311171
8338. it could all be straightened out	later	138.8596290972261
8339. not very much later but when things had settled down a little	642.8215257138594
8340. after this deal with the bouvardier woman went through	391.44389022796764
8341. an ace	of spades h	14.924449551976625
8342. he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps	there was a little something in that indeed	2340.6948313738253
8343. he rather wished he	had never got into the business and still- scarcely to be resisted	a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money h	katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now	rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change	5096.321524231708
8344. she	did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without	a smile or a word of thanks	3047.3834170389905
8345. usually she marked the few who did	thank you you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and	she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she	could act to the others before they'd take offense threaten to call	the manager	4740.901233876486
8346. funny how seldom they did: used to it probably	388.28570599955015
8347. the	kind who came into a cheap store like this! grab snatch i saw	that first! and here i'll take this i was before her	you wait on me now or i don't bother with it see! this kind of	place h   she'd be through here just no time at all- leave	this kind of thing 'way behind	5394.349002934889
8348. off at noon and she'd never come	back	252.04889682252505
8349. money- a lot of money enough	43.0911267741211
8350. she'd	be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills so's	nobody would suspect- maybe couldn't get it until monday account	of that the banks- but that wasn't really long to wait	5875.026690158791
8351. not when	she'd waited so long already	93.36267876247136
8352. no need say anything at all	to the old woman	561.4610007170461
8353. she had it all planned out how she'd do	261.56939150818243
8354. she'd	say she didn't feel good on sunday couldn't go to church- there'd	be a little argument but she could be stubborn- and when the	old woman had gone quick pack the things she'd need to take all	but the dress she'd wear monday and take the bag down to that place	in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for	a dime	8777.883185885501
8355. then on monday morning- or it might have to be tuesday-	get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money	in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer	3952.360060461666
8356. she	wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after katya had left	go do the daily shopping	3066.2130171602867
8357. no need leave a note with it either-	or maybe just something like don't worry about me i'm going away	to make a better life	2600.10462446624
8358. it wasn't	as if she wanted much	140.7164071153318
8359. she didn't mind working hard not as if	she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft- all she	wanted was a chance where she wasn't marked as what she was	3560.0029007151234
8360. to	be katharine ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little	more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies' manners	and all like that and get to know different people than up to now	not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the	ones went to the same church and- different place different job different	people she'd be all different too	0.30166232349522504
8361. prettier she'd do her	hair another way; smarter and wear different kinds of clothes-	she'd be katharine ross just what that sounded like	2313.450795174723
8362. you've give me the wrong change said the customer sharply	560.8942644673375
8363. think	i can't count	2.959020481928744
8364. katya made up the amount in indifferent	silence	250.0379232727812
8365. she was listening to other voices out of the future	370.05576349832444
8366. some of those vaguely-imagined new different people	139.37830349197213
8367. oh katharine's	awfully nice and pretty too i like katharine- let's	ask katharine to go with us she's always lots of fun- katharine-	soon very soon now h	mendoza	didn't	wake until nearly nine-thirty	3644.2107687096577
8368. it was going to be another hot	day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety	1644.7275509415551
8369. alison was still	sound asleep; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk	drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found	a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly	of face powder	4118.814360722185
8370. he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call	him sometime today and drove home	2358.2130738920728
8371. after he'd got out fresh	liver for bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her	dish	1721.9021217190736
8372. surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle	566.8134080465999
8373. he	seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters	and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a	dozen kittens	2464.8223266794794
8374. y que sigue despues	4.411906574592462
8375. - what then	0.20041515
8376. he	asked her severely	4.411088929058463
8377. a lot of people are so peculiar that they don't	like cats it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good	homes for kittens- and damn it you know very well if i have them	around long impossible to give them away! and i suppose now that	you've finally grown up if a little late you'd go on producing	kittens every six months or so	5844.891890564044
8378. yes well it's a pity to spoil your	girlish figure- which all those kittens would do anyway- but i	think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so	there won't be any more h	6083.516095440262
8379. i wonder if the carters would take one	h	263.73246521653977
8380. and it's no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately	around his ankles	1876.5955013048745
8381. maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up	43.122049332869196
8382. happened to be in the	hall! happened to hear you quarrel about her! oh well you can't	really blame lolotte	2829.3117556678776
8383. she lost her beau to you	43.80278424373121
8384. but	she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door;	sarah remembered it clearly	2816.087696912671
8385. i've got to	get busy	14.831329207122376
8386. miss celie's taken to her bed with the door locked	556.9037462992588
8387. she	opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you	1100.57687638776
8388. here-	she thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into sarah's	hand	1877.999462476738
8389. not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse	and the storehouse now	944.4869124388645
8390. maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring	it down her throat	753.589052277246
8391. i don't want it sarah said firmly	93.23341677508151
8392. well- i'll take it down with me as i go	562.5819749293953
8393. maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take	off with a racing start	2034.5940601968773
8394. at the door she turned back her roman nose	looking very long now and satiric	1650.6848938290818
8395. ben and lucien	have gone after them	93.30629207830617
8396. it's just like that book your northern friend	wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds	2807.4278611896207
8397. i don't know mrs stowe h	43.807638069817166
8398. what can they	do if they find them	249.61114339363422
8399. they can't do anything	2.950592253155696
8400. it's	silly childish running after them like that	249.6197313223342
8401. but	of course the paterollers won't be of any help not with everything	so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around	god knows where	2984.3506099684355
8402. she had swished away she had been gone for	a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to	stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it	5311.2707588906505
8403. but then the	so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable-	especially that cup!   she was deeply horribly sure	that lucien had filled it with opium	3320.412378151576
8404. she had quarreled with lucien	she had resisted his demands for money- and if she died by the provisions	of her marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not	only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office but	later when the war was over her father's entire estate	7539.039758676046
8405. she	felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time	645.2270365772852
8406. now wait a	minute she told herself think about it; lucien is not the only person	in this house who could have put opium in that coffee	4259.392963385962
8407. she	had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new orleans	1259.0442380774532
8408. or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa	746.5391549080445
8409. yes	she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just	before emile was shot	1417.1530515402048
8410. rilly or glendora had entered her room while	she slept bringing back her washed clothes	1644.9926045071793
8411. so somebody else could	have come in too- then or later while she was out of the room	1565.0901698793818
8412. it	would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor	966.1737266622016
8413. it was	not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable	opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her	2607.308430932074
8414. he	didn't even know that she was there	248.76888489321544
8415. and he certainly couldn't	have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she	was not the yielding- yes and credible fool he had every right to	expect	3448.206293880658
8416. no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised	386.08282018444254
8417. then somebody else	0.20041515
8418. don't question rev had said don't	invite danger	250.7046462234801
8419. her skin crawled: lolotte had told maude that	she was in the hall and the door was open	1571.4340639842717
8420. sarah had begun to tell	lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept	across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show	a rim of blackness in the hall	6062.18570874211
8421. so lolotte- or anybody- could have	listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with	the missing bottle of opium	2033.296668260698
8422. that was not reasonable either	22.34582572714742
8423. the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him	could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen sarah's	own doubts and suspicions- and questions	2999.4834423838784
8424. she began to doubt	whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup	2350.195636453497
8425. so	suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa!	that made a certain amount of logic	1879.0996976496415
8426. added to the	argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it	had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldn't	have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by	its taste	6999.006649592137
8427. it was merely an attempt to frighten her	166.49272265226824
8428. she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't	run like a scared cat	2130.2015760249365
8429. but- well she'd be very careful	43.823993383634004
8430. she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense	of normal everyday life	1652.3001637460843
8431. but before she left her room she dug	into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract	and the wax seal had been broken	2991.183574940006
8432. so somebody else knew what	would happen to her father's money if she died	1410.5239293355223
8433. rev had known	all along	14.847171774310501
8434. rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract	and find out	1404.831371920016
8435. he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev	loved honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body; rev	had stressed the need for money	2992.7553774269895
8436. rev would never have tried to give her	poison!   she thrust the envelope back in the bag; there	was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking	the barn after the horse was stolen	6325.48457233087
8437. and in all likelihood by now	there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her	marriage contract	2312.712143098438
8438. there was no point either in telling herself again	what a fool she'd been	1409.7457333940015
8439. she went downstairs and received another	curious shock for when glendora flapped into the dining room in	her homemade moccasins sarah asked her when she had brought coffee	to her room and glendora said she hadn't	3840.622539971681
8440. too much work this morning	miss sarah- everybody gone like that-   sarah swallowed	past another kind of constriction in her throat	3014.4786503120545
8441. well then	who brought it	14.807070472383236
8442. miss maude	0.30041514999999996
8443. she come to the kitchen	and say she take it up to you	790.0625566368172
8444. glendora put down a dish of lukewarm	rice	250.70150921476102
8445. not much breakfast this morning	14.824015058807575
8446. i don't know what we're	going to do miss sarah	556.2067152137778
8447. we've got to eat	sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again	938.9766513910687
8448. the rice wasn't dosed with opium	indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt	2358.568823106241
8449. she ate what she	could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping	from the vines	1737.5982515719047
8450. in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking	chickens	249.95106635054108
8451. get a basket sarah told her	43.000888362007416
8452. we'll go to the	storehouse	22.32227134140828
8453. glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers	and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse	1723.9946888592185
8454. sarah	found the right key and unlocked the door	394.2543835953587
8455. it was a long	low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines	had run rampant over that too	2608.141223758846
8456. it was dark but dry and cool	142.1760260523586
8457. she	doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried	peas eggs cornmeal a little salt	1728.6865808002901
8458. the shelves looked emptier than	when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from	the commissary had called; there were certainly now fewer mouths	to feed but there was less to feed them with	6040.778243352608
8459. she took glendora to	the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still	a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained	rafters	2979.255263092189
8460. they wouldn't go hungry not yet	64.46896133295509
8461. and the fields	were green and growing	93.30792762237498
8462. can't you possibly imagine what life is	going to be like here	962.1237140677646
8463. maude had said	0.20041515
8464. she	sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden	1179.0962531758257
8465. she	stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking	of maude	1262.3154110358087
8466. maude had the opportunity to take the bottle	of opium from sarah's room	1184.60834996127
8467. maude had the cool ruthlessness to d	o	whatever she made up her mind to do	1264.4384516172788
8468. she couldn't see how her death	could affect maude	391.78909103694696
8469. she couldn't see any reason why maude would	attempt to frighten her	637.4171090629973
8470. besides there was something hysterical and	silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her	1886.5763245716407
8471. maude	was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if she	had ever	been childish	1257.237777810975
8472. yet maude had suggested that sarah return to	new york	554.7428798537911
8473. maude could have shot emile- if she'd had a reason	to kill him	795.5518606688079
8474. there was no use in standing there in the drizzle	trying to find a link between emile's murder and opium in a cup	of coffee	3861.3516340358606
8475. she started back for the house saw a light in the	office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was	far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder	3569.1813603354594
8476. rev george	and lolotte were mending shoes	140.3216662896864
8477. a lighted lamp stood on the	table that dusky drizzling day	501.58268964715654
8478. they were all three bent over a shabby	riding boot; george had a tack hammer	1653.3532538494753
8479. lolotte held a patch of	leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for george's	poised hammer	1413.7424633481728
8480. george said first thing i do when i get to vicksburg	again is get me a yankee-   with boots on	lolotte laughed softly	3478.0983574948127
8481. rev looked up and saw her	43.439606448223216
8482. lolotte	looked up and stiffened	22.404409455819184
8483. george didn't look up at all	43.259677150827294
8484. there was	no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised	at sarah's appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless-	and just possibly dead	4983.878041587938
8485. rev said come in sarah	14.738639699689674
8486. reckon	you know the news	22.3966219239275
8487. and what news sarah thought as satirically	as maude might have said it	789.4126509272869
8488. rev's face was suddenly	a little fixed and questioning	392.57812095349215
8489. he turned to george and lolotte	43.5581577451553
8490. take	your cobbler's shop somewhere else	64.61352909317951
8491. i want to talk to sarah	43.33558695402215
8492. everything in the office the spreading circle of lamplight	the patch of leather in lolotte's hands	1883.1243834772915
8493. george poised with the	tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt	at murder	1268.444847892128
8494. a rush of panic caught sarah	65.16995632024339
8495. i mean	i've got to- to see to the kitchen	375.15976360567925
8496. glendora-   her words	jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the	question in rev's face	2836.6309881856146
8497. now why did i do that	43.542003312844585
8498. she thought	as warm drizzling rain touched her face	387.8847937048121
8499. she was no schoolgirl	refusing to bear tales	167.43223488584474
8500. as she reached the kitchen door the answer	presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien	her husband	3459.4553180629023
8501. it might be indeed it had already proved	to be a marriage without love but it was marriage	1573.6519871559162
8502. so she couldn't	choose rev as a confidant; it must be lucien	962.2441250343636
8503. always provided	that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought	as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it	2589.4992503411045
8504. she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly	that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into	the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude	was cleaning lamp chimneys	6326.444820703884
8505. miss sarah	i can't cut up no chicken	166.6935124853212
8506. miss maude say she won't	22.302318752761835
8507. again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious	attempt to frighten her- or to murder her	1720.3024501618456
8508. the homely everyday	details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her	with their immediate urgency	2113.4346218178607
8509. no matter what had happened or hadn't	happened	somebody had to see about dinner	941.4633987739095
8510. she eyed the chickens with if she	had known it something of glendora's dismal look and thought with	a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin verbs	4841.886356366975
8511. i didn't think there was any reason	to	164.51958641542257
8512. speak to him again anyway	22.347887265462766
8513. try	talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone	643.6424416497963
8514. try	to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with	women	2127.80904447824
8515. you might try looking into his wife too	167.44841635735352
8516. she might have been	talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been	having any trouble	2578.8444949426157
8517. you think black's the one we're	looking for	167.17995901412502
8518. yeah	0.30041514999999996
8519. i think he might be conrad	said grimly	166.4551151865483
8520. then again he might not	22.129627514712354
8521. what a stinking	world rourke said	43.48634311598826
8522. black is gilborn's best friend	22.30895307785614
8523. will you be coming back soon	43.51887371876403
8524. i think so	0.30041514999999996
8525. i'm on my way to see the jacobs woman	262.4723503607832
8526. gilborn's secretary	0.30041514999999996
8527. what for	0.20041515
8528. you don't think gilborn	is the-	66.01480396806043
8529. i don't think anything	2.950592253155696
8530. i just don't	want to go off half-cocked before picking up black that's all	1409.9677283846859
8531. gilborn says he was in his office all day with	her yesterday	639.204540468583
8532. i'd like to make sure	22.08706581472945
8533. also it's just possible	she might know something about mrs gilborn	505.68910441570563
8534. aren't you ever going to go home	140.7714608131536
8535. it sure as hell doesn't look like it does it	375.5500367771491
8536. i'm telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us	to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off	3476.048943330899
8537. remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet	375.6347079605938
8538. conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging	his right leg	1415.1751652889222
8539. he looked at his watch	14.7912192592417
8540. it was ten minutes	before eleven	64.67519279048378
8541. he wondered how long it would be before they	had a signed confession from lionel black	1254.4370852467005
8542. thirty years' experience	let him know even at this early stage that black was his	man	1878.0460714648216
8543. but he still wanted to know why	93.62079120763731
8544. it was a cold windy	day the day after kitti's death but stanley gilborn paid no	attention to the blustery october wind	3294.347271287653
8545. after leaving conrad	gilborn had no destination	94.64047807659728
8546. he simply walked not noticing where	he was not caring	558.4450483044785
8547. he stopped automatically at the street corners	waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his	coat open and flapping	2321.5728091723104
8548. as he walked he tried to think	140.2652863473937
8549. mainly of what conrad had tried to make	him believe	374.26811894606647
8550. there was nothing coherent about his thinking	141.7462721078006
8551. it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind: the	same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession	2321.5881609645185
8552. the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible	for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality	of it	3680.330931314177
8553. conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only	167.42090085437601
8554. emotionally they penetrated him not at all	139.963626047726
8555. whoever he	was and your wife were intimate	165.88865512253932
8556. gilborn remembered conrad's	exact words	22.4668521777734
8557. they made sense and yet they didn't	93.16856053239312
8558. he knew conrad	had told him the truth	252.1487896775934
8559. yet it wasn't so	2.965924380447892
8560. it wasn't	so because it couldn't be so	249.79545875900044
8561. when kitti was alive-	and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm-	she had been the center of his life	2600.3693036267396
8562. she was the sun he the	closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing	and visible yet removed	3057.705550099474
8563. for fifty-five years he had lived progressing	towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan	without reason	1421.2700607758184
8564. kitti had come along to justify everything	140.250230837297
8565. she	was his goal she was his reason	166.35335926541362
8566. he had lived all his life waiting	for her	389.037367555624
8567. not once in the time that he had known her had he	ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth	of a second of her infidelity	2976.220715997467
8568. he could not consider it now	65.47687834465125
8569. and so he walked aimless again	43.47854930703758
8570. the walk ended	inevitably right in front of his hotel building	748.8477372357696
8571. the doorman began	to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what	had happened to him the night before	2031.8712838440013
8572. he looked at gilborn with undisguised	curiosity	141.35224825574076
8573. gilborn passed by him without seeing him	93.6069050718111
8574. he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own	thoughts	1648.0984527723624
8575. in the apartment itself all was still	92.88745336374545
8576. the police	were no longer there	64.93847241813805
8577. there was no evidence that anything was different	than it had been	635.3503555341363
8578. except that kitti wasn't there	22.160261590486922
8579. without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still	faced the closed bedroom door	1562.9197943641443
8580. at last sitting there in the	familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in	1406.480654442069
8581. who	0.20041515
8582. he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed	him	1187.174815594925
8583. who	0.20041515
8584. she was all he had everything he had	everything he wanted	756.7690289362877
8585. someone had taken her away from him	94.11083385407699
8586. who	0.30041514999999996
8587. where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there	is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days	1893.1025723399475
8588. where	there is a victim there is a killer	393.86231698644224
8589. who	0.20041515
8590. whoever he was and your wife were intimate	248.66116764094892
8591. he rose from	the	chair took off his coat	261.59152209259076
8592. quickly he went into the bedroom	65.6784874553412
8593. the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain	374.4893695956312
8594. gilborn stood	there for a long time	140.27668958598912
8595. he looked at the bed unblinkingly	43.85752666108615
8596. the	bed was empty now	22.389391001198966
8597. kitti would lie in it no more	93.69998705174123
8598. he would lie in	it no more	140.45293314974893
8599. gilborn wondered whether kitti had lain in that	same bed with h who	783.8760741044296
8600. for thirty minutes stanley gilborn	stood there	141.24809603436694
8601. at the end of the half-hour racking his brains	thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he	left the bedroom	2462.7117438934306
8602. who	0.30041514999999996
8603. he could think of no answer	43.16763876957795
8604. gilborn put on his coat again	64.81357493025875
8605. before leaving he took one	last lingering look at the apartment	504.06003697889565
8606. he knew he would never	see it again	251.01823902817213
8607. in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley	gilborn was a lone figure	1111.618424746782
8608. on blanche jacobs kitti	gilborn's death had a quite different effect	752.850746570194
8609. for blanche kitti's	death was a source of guilty but nonetheless soaring happy hope	945.1531396294542
8610. in blanche's defense it must be said she was unaware of	the newborn hope	1405.1008958575962
8611. if anyone had asked her she would have described	herself only as nervous and worried	1103.568856262849
8612. the figures on the worksheet	paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it	was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with	the typewriter	5614.290158914618
8613. she wondered whether stanley would call	43.85299143080586
8614. she	wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she	knew he needed	2128.246976393631
8615. she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that	he might call while she was out	1404.4884485135021
8616. and now she was feeling	sick both from concern about stanley and hunger	1193.1884399667188
8617. why hadn't	he called	2.934865718615
8618. men she reflected even men like stanley	are unpredictable	396.30930212944713
8619. she tried to think of his unpredictable	actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't	so many after all	2461.8335321901814
8620. stanley really was quite predictable	22.276882796365456
8621. that was one of the things she liked about stanley	377.57324116946586
8622. he wasn't like	so many other men	141.1725429612277
8623. the dentist last night for instance	43.75451879183366
8624. dinner and	the movies had been fine	141.7897210486582
8625. he had taken her upstairs to say good night	262.2731678274149
8626. she had invited him in for coffee	139.66659535591532
8627. it was in the kitchen	as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that	he had grabbed for her	2316.638851298497
8628. without warning without giving her a chance	to prepare for it	745.8036621817348
8629. from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders	turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldn't breathe	2321.955955309345
8630. later she apologized for the long scratch across his face	tried to explain she couldn't help herself that the panic arose	in her unwanted	3678.0483043196255
8631. when he left she knew	she would never see him again	504.24428114250304
8632. she	could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she	first met him	1885.2970742488656
8633. except for that one morning	14.97231089898354
8634. the morning he walked	in to announce to her blushing that he was married	1400.9542829960606
8635. she thought	she was going to die	93.25363009500913
8636. she had assumed before then that one	day he would ask her to marry him	1646.4914708417043
8637. blanche couldn't remember	when she had first arrived at this conclusion	500.1186196120049
8638. she thought it was	sometime during the second week she worked for stanley	1177.506830034703
8639. it was nothing	that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she	should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal	2967.8490807334356
8640. she was thirty-one years old then	65.51562437458452
8641. her mother was already considerably	concerned over her daughter's future	373.3615088119258
8642. but blanche had been	able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed	mother's continued carping had been able to resist her urgings	to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony	6041.671397785292
8643. for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would	propose	794.5449948509684
8644. it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in	taking such a momentous step	2126.086225202408
8645. stanley went along in life she knew	convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman	1568.780018649099
8646. as a result	he never looked for it	250.29018095977148
8647. but one day she expected he would	somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such	a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love faith	and anything else a woman could give a husband	4468.915984767096
8648. indeed there was	a woman who unasked had already given him love	969.5739061287902
8649. and then unexpectedly stanley made his	announcement	94.63746451710958
8650. on that first day blanche literally thought	she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind	3271.9156615033426
8651. it might have been easier for her if kitti walker hadn't been	everything that blanche was not	1406.1876938205742
8652. kitti was thirty years younger	than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any	right to hope for much less expect	3278.4419026052574
8653. kitti could have married a score	of men	166.17396581734215
8654. there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley	gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley	3039.6895421573577
8655. kitti	had come into the office on somebody's recommendation because she	needed help in preparing her income tax return	1734.5569314469692
8656. stanley had	filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close	to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting	her to accept	5158.153973818944
8657. blanche knew all this because the door	to stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could	hear everything that was said	2455.488915881363
8658. stanley had gone out saying	he would be back in an hour	962.6134572819021
8659. he hadn't come back for over two	94.28944577963833
8660. after that day blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened	751.2520280956082
8661. there were mornings when stanley came in late afternoons when	he left early days when he didn't come in at all	2026.6455135289173
8662. blanche	knew something must be causing stanley's new strange behavior but	she never once connected it with kitti walker	2573.257724200519
8663. then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office	stanley announced he and kitti were married	1739.2306388098532
8664. somehow blanche	managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations	963.6307816990333
8665. that night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon	in acapulco	784.6123017819043
8666. while they were away blanche came into the office	every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley	going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically	out of habit	5809.974323621977
8667. for exactly one week she was able to	continue in this manner	637.438862920062
8668. on the morning of stanley's return	however her strength left her	743.7629164476649
8669. two hours of watching his serenely	happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled	figures and blanche had to leave	2603.4742760098843
8670. she stayed away for ten	days	64.78072217018322
8671. those ten days were like no others that blanche had known	504.0323167464039
8672. mostly she stayed in bed	22.1004329292659
8673. she didn't tell anyone even her	mother what was wrong	373.7428185330166
8674. she refused to have a doctor insisting there	was nothing a doctor could do for her	1878.236225236435
8675. right said the fingerprint man	14.704791176858706
8676. also if you're going	to believe those prints you'll have to look for a killer who's	a top-grade piano player	2821.1261444152015
8677. he demonstrated by playing an	imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack	1261.345103547827
8678. to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change	of manner the killing of rose mallory	2794.1581144119914
8679. his hands snatched at an	imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal	snap like a ball that's been bounced hard	2737.078305011958
8680. in the same way he	pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his	hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that	3884.5540197476003
8681. he was moving	like a ballet dancer playing for laughs	375.0182640629156
8682. if rose mallory's killer	acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch	2109.0096900442372
8683. we'd	know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined	in his hair	1254.1104511560038
8684. perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this	boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered	woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix	of our seriousness	5925.400116614803
8685. this you will remember was still new year's	day	260.9928856796519
8686. by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one	would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children	and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have	been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active	interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats	8417.788927958416
8687. he had retained his hat and his horn	and	whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it	2019.8944154578935
8688. that incidentally	might give you some idea of what felix was like	963.2895861344484
8689. after	all he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning	781.425478768323
8690. the me's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination	and the body had been removed for autopsy	1894.367641869208
8691. the meat wagon therefore	was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster	of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs	to screen any comings and goings	4021.431432486207
8692. there was furthermore the	crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops	to hold them at a decent distance	3725.295537173697
8693. just put yourself in felix's	place for a moment	260.6380139092386
8694. you're a taxpayer householder landlord	22.24870402860588
8695. you've been away from home for the new year festivities but now	the party is over and you come home	1891.7876963919146
8696. defining sobriety in the limited	sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol	ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober	4688.758540060076
8697. you still have your paper hat and you're wearing it but then	it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else	you may be you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame	out in the back yard	4457.842457416368
8698. it's not too much to assume that you will	have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr average	citizen	3269.479900063333
8699. you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy	fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant	greeting to your friends and tenants	3122.5565339518444
8700. you find your house a	focus of public and police attention	755.3775524113279
8701. can you imagine yourself forgetting	under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and	unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn	2750.4190375143958
8702. maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness	140.6456258165115
8703. you shoulder	your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to	the	cop on the door	1878.7105226785388
8704. you identify yourself and ask him what's going	on	391.6913191599253
8705. instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts	up the stairs	1262.1292261319172
8706. got the upstairs guy he bellows	64.75442136721216
8707. do i send him up	14.862261739364138
8708. then he turns back to you	65.59051303247642
8709. go	on in he says	14.812734517441886
8710. they'll tell you what's cooking	22.187740523625045
8711. even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that	something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable	official control could you go on forgetting that you still had	that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish	horn in your hand	5146.928716494654
8712. what i'm getting at is that we	were fully prepared for felix's being an odd one	1873.8609955620911
8713. we'd seen his	handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenants had told us	of him did make him sound a little special	2725.457008336173
8714. we were not however prepared	for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came	up the stairs	2589.419235958055
8715. he of course must have been equally unprepared for	what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling	1867.2061684553323
8716. if felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn	because he'd forgotten about them he now remembered	2609.708480604221
8717. he came bounding	up the stairs and joined the dance	376.9911999965435
8718. he adjusted the hat lifted	the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside	our fingerprint expert to cavort with him	4293.914869722315
8719. our man stopped	dead and glowered at felix	167.79967119040543
8720. felix threw his head back and laughed a	laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house	2830.5754534119096
8721. this	was a bull of a man	93.65746073361149
8722. he was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed	65.57108797615689
8723. his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed	he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably	home-grown	2736.310925896524
8724. i don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite	so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures	3039.40658403446
8725. his	hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck	942.0140275523988
8726. he had only	a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short	1185.9016330393126
8727. it was almost as white	as his teeth	169.19613338924222
8728. for a man of his mass he was curiously short	555.7100159827903
8729. he	wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure	787.6699935477641
8730. a man with so big	and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms	is expected to stand taller than five feet five	4109.822946484512
8731. for felix it was	a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement	940.1704970889547
8732. the man was just this	side of being a freak	561.5961943616855
8733. we waited till he had finished laughing	and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him	1728.9190554217566
8734. he was dressed	in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's	country weekend	1648.6310001166512
8735. dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel	shirt black silk necktie	789.0142479953199
8736. he was freshly	shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have	missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter	4828.386310857972
8737. eventually he subsided	0.20041515
8738. me he said merrily	4.406711465935457
8739. that much latin we remember gibby said dryly	167.23453473926392
8740. you	always live up to your name always like this always making happy	1187.4832385100844
8741. i try felix said blithely	14.777936113550442
8742. the world is full	of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene	1644.6276406249603
8743. i've	never noticed that it improves things any	164.871947357132
8744. bully for you	gibby said	22.230031210901476
8745. what's the rest of your name	43.44475207528795
8746. no	rest of it	4.39894529706599
8747. felix is all there is	14.820007750385486
8748. all there ever	was	4.409337810600458
8749. the past i leave to historians felix intoned	demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy	1576.2972174593813
8750. you	live in the present	22.28224118354302
8751. in the present felix proclaimed	14.883059207950344
8752. is there any other time in which a man	can live	751.6324608352509
8753. we gibby announced are not philosophers	43.542446331899654
8754. we are assistant district attorneys	22.031417082766005
8755. this gentleman is a police	officer	44.181539781171615
8756. he is a fingerprint specialist	22.05660726014967
8757. could your future your	immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a	bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him	your finger tips	3548.8114422199615
8758. the happy one could never have looked	happier	251.9334309830549
8759. this was more than joy	14.836936466497601
8760. those lovely	whorls he chortled	22.11359323161864
8761. come right	along	0.20041515
8762. he was prancing along the	hall heading for the next flight of stairs	1183.7743925678017
8763. we're here because of what happened last night he said	372.7560219496776
8764. since it is important for the record	let's have the full name	959.3917625945214
8765. grubb felix whispered	0.20041515
8766. felix grubb	0.30041514999999996
8767. gibby asked not bothering to whisper	43.39962361351668
8768. i can't see what would	make it necessary for you to know	960.9153803936655
8769. nothing could make it necessary	to proclaim it to the whole world	640.8384438760448
8770. obligingly gibby lowered	his voice	22.273769917041257
8771. edmund but	not for years	14.867187984430055
8772. for years it's been just felix	65.71923369822063
8773. first thing i did	after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially	changed and this is something i don't tell everybody	2595.7170070861043
8774. that was	almost forty years ago	65.44236678568855
8775. having volunteered that he was a man	of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered	the number less credible	2466.902478218152
8776. this was a broth of a boy our felix and	nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile	he was and how full of juice and spirit	5155.4582216287245
8777. we followed him up the	stairs	43.673294125911454
8778. the cops would gather up connor and the foursome on the third	floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting	3903.939930151448
8779. you may think we didn't need nancy and jean	but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee	that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were	through with this case	4208.2109264875235
8780. also if we had excluded the ladies we would	have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where	we stood	4094.4942725824794
8781. the killer if in our present group would certainly be	interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint	evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information	to improve on his situation there might always be some way	4798.618331423954
8782. if	you can possibly avoid it you don't hand out any extra chances	1175.3156698950645
8783. felix took us into his studio	43.713510369850276
8784. it was that oddly shaped space	at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate	themselves to the varying angles of roof slope	4285.748137567965
8785. at each angle of its	pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights	were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades	2984.355966180951
8786. when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly	drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night	3484.10931524298
8787. he quickly fixed	that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens	on the others	1733.8312258195206
8788. he flew about the place making these adjustments	and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience	3472.6433183633417
8789. none of his movements was tentative	43.47989722018949
8790. there was no process of	trial and error	250.75936840352125
8791. starting with the room completely blacked out as it	was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place	was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting	even so much as a crack of glare	4461.941862250216
8792. expecting something more-than-average	wacky i was surprised by what we found	745.4416059338457
8793. there was no display	of either works in progress or of finished work	793.0209270138085
8794. here and there on	work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped	over it	2846.879538936072
8795. these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling	501.21677271185473
8796. they were all completely shrouded	22.448281769631492
8797. the equipment was solid and heavy	and in good condition	373.583422130637
8798. everything was orderly and it seemed to be	arranged for the workman's comfort convenience and efficiency	1887.9347250340932
8799. there	were tools about but they were neatly kept	261.0594163970897
8800. there was no confusion	and no litter	140.7655049917766
8801. supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins	261.07778870727526
8802. andy did not see the newspapers the next day	394.2709622115097
8803. someone on his staff-	he suspected it was ed thornburg- intercepted them and for	this andy was grateful	1565.5008064064982
8804. he finally fell asleep around six in	the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used	and didn't awaken until early afternoon	4279.7538276889345
8805. memory flooded him the	instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach	1259.507826183564
8806. outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day	251.59409596227547
8807. presumably	the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped	him	1249.8385094915297
8808. but where	0.30041514999999996
8809. it was still a very big world despite all	the modern cant to the contrary	1106.6006249169782
8810. hub was sitting in a chair that	blocked the hall door	748.870642072623
8811. he was dozing perhaps the only sleep he'd	gotten	262.50839320014256
8812. he snapped to alertness at andy's entrance	140.96572417915507
8813. lot of people waiting to see you though	167.90222556354112
8814. questions	about the show tonight	22.48800599186588
8815. hub picked up the telephone	14.868329537694226
8816. shall i	let them know you're awake	139.9892527927015
8817. i suppose	0.20041515
8818. how's lissa	do you know	22.452299543028083
8819. hub considered	0.20041515
8820. she's	got plenty of guts mr paxton	141.4848685088205
8821. you want me to call her	43.042130500097684
8822. she expecting me to	4.402921942260646
8823. hub shook his head so andy told	him not to bother	501.5813915222908
8824. the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort	or to be comforted	1170.9966402417344
8825. he could not manage the former or expect the	latter; they had nothing to give to each other	1575.2655962580718
8826. the omission might	look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through	the motions simply for the sake of appearances	3691.286746662742
8827. he had little	time to himself anyway	93.57127543666711
8828. as the afternoon sped toward evening	the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each	with his own special problem	3898.1076107369736
8829. thornburg arrived with the writers	14.851804919288119
8830. they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay	songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations	3722.1143812484647
8831. what	remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified	as befitting the tragic circumstances	1417.1935417688824
8832. raymond fox reported that the	orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed	1878.4163344160067
8833. charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first	to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas	engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that	a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casino's	open date	4828.093435597422
8834. and once bake slipped in pale and drawn last	night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it	3245.920182868869
8835. he asked if there was anything he could do	262.230644444557
8836. andy invented a job to	keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute	arrangements	2587.366522294483
8837. but from rocco vecchio they heard nothing	93.62659396145166
8838. at last it was time to depart	140.31048115254322
8839. hub nosing about spotted	reporters in the lobby so andy was hustled away quietly through the	hotel's service entrance in a strange car which hub had procured somewhere	2980.156477211768
8840. they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but	there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub	2811.862824102052
8841. el dorado	was surrounded by a mob	94.10950198526619
8842. they overflowed the parking lot making progress	by automobile difficult	560.5480614334258
8843. long before he reached the protection of	the stage door andy was recognized	782.6276231786434
8844. word of his arrival spread through	the crowd like a brushfire	757.6456184951328
8845. they surged around him fingers pointing	eyes prying	168.11572173821676
8846. it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the	difference from last night's hero-worshippers	1641.856199322873
8847. they had come not	to admire but to observe	259.58335837042875
8848. it's worse inside thornburg	informed andy	65.65385945798631
8849. skolman's jammed in every table he could find	166.9667096324569
8850. under the heading of it's an ill wind et cetera	558.6100423875005
8851. backstage	was tomblike by contrast	14.753822943257415
8852. andy's co-workers kept their distance	awed by the tragedy	394.07728187211364
8853. but in his dressing room was a large bouquet	and a card that read we're with you all the way	1879.5004185364603
8854. it was signed	by everyone in the troupe	250.3882959404294
8855. andy couldn't help but be touched	43.187619937243156
8856. he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted	on the call board	2121.894856991617
8857. bake was waiting to report that lou duvol	had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently	1880.884408497009
8858. andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment	393.54824571878305
8859. bake himself	looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding	632.9121843494817
8860. andy told him bake i wish you'd talk to skolman see if	some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside	3470.2682221881028
8861. it's just barely	possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get	a table	1255.2378926296728
8862. i wouldn't want him to miss the message	249.80410978275927
8863. skolman isn't going to like it much though giving away	what he should be selling	1093.4132349959023
8864. skolman wasn't the only one who	didn't care for andy's scheme	751.4391298380567
8865. a short time later lieutenant	bonner stomped into the dressing room	505.41766550646554
8866. i got a bone to pick with	you mr paxton	563.6968704247668
8867. andy	rolled up the revised script he had been studying	374.53047270561024
8868. what about them	0.30041514999999996
8869. they're going to louse me up good	93.03014978590005
8870. my men have been	here all afternoon setting up for this thing	954.9909572333858
8871. bonner explained	that with the nightclub's cooperation the police had occupied el	dorado like a battlefield	1268.60555437335
8872. motion picture cameras had been installed	to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name	by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot	scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead	6091.353166800243
8873. however it was virtually	impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower	available for the purpose	1738.30577125979
8874. i want you to have the speakers taken	out	389.538625890161
8875. seems like we're never going to see	eye to eye lieutenant	499.70633306972
8876. didn't they tell you what i wanted the p	a system for	962.8137642647046
8877. sure i know	0.20041515
8878. but it's such a	long shot-   no longer than yours	561.1433577598107
8879. what do you expect	to get tonight anyway	167.2287793667366
8880. you think somebody is going to stand up in	the audience and make guilty faces	1644.7173682486693
8881. or have a sign on his car that	says 'here	comes the paxton kidnapper'	945.7033671022236
8882. andy crumbled the	script in his fist	139.703132039355
8883. i can't stop you from doing what you think	is right	508.43389243271565
8884. but don't try to stop me either	139.55058852083454
8885. someday	bonner said you're going to ask us for help	370.8508754454788
8886. what you don't understand is that i'm asking	for it now	751.8361827199059
8887. but bonner departed still full of ill will	165.1657831950914
8888. he	had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to	cling to routine tested procedures	2817.017104936246
8889. to act otherwise would be to admit	his helplessness	262.600153877936
8890. but admit or not bonner was helpless	141.0812647653547
8891. the	crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient	to be caught by a checklist	1419.1455401711917
8892. andy's performance was scheduled	for eleven o'clock	140.7060910440521
8893. he stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to	hear something from vecchio about the ransom money	1267.9241642242973
8894. bake and shirl	winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable	location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information	regarding his efforts	4459.984791141742
8895. the sweaty bastard's	probably halfway to peru with our money by now	641.0213928478391
8896. when no one	smiled he felt constrained to add just kidding natch	963.795101803131
8897. thornburg popped in to advise andy skolman's sending up	smoke signals	503.6428911369039
8898. you about ready	0.30041514999999996
8899. what's he complaining	about	2.9700691245991484
8900. bake asked	0.30041514999999996
8901. they're drinking aren't they	2.9296493021190524
8902. no	0.30041514999999996
8903. we got a bunch of sippers out there tonight	260.57263762706054
8904. i guess	nobody wants to pass out and miss anything	555.7530190865245
8905. thornburg added in a	lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an	audience	1583.9441026718962
8906. andy said well i guess we can't wait any	longer	558.7941400092079
8907. hub you stick by the stage door	93.75133897113093
8908. if rock shows up during	the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal	1650.5200442324542
8909. shirl winter said i'll stay on the phone mr paxton	376.59599064990687
8910. there's	a couple of call-backs i can work on	392.1285492596493
8911. you're	a sweetheart- but leave one line open	166.71569331735174
8912. he may try to phone us	64.8953798195615
8913. andy	passed into the corridor their good lucks! following him	376.24670576939985
8914. it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded	different as if he really needed it	2594.530323577051
8915. the	act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon	had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone	1718.3045295561024
8916. the result had nothing	of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night	1412.7015344227743
8917. here's where	luck would normally step in	94.65833142660459
8918. but this was no ordinary show and andy	knew it	563.0116849538233
8919. whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it	644.7323826979323
8920. the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge	747.4525254888481
8921. twenty-four	hours had changed him from a performer to a freak	504.00361403592376
8922. within this	framework what followed was strained even macabre	390.48844824668254
8923. eliminating	the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs	of equal melancholy	1416.8399818468965
8924. the effect was as depressing as a gravestone	the applause irresolute and short-lived	1188.099087621947
8925. yet andy plowed ahead mouthing	the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and	gradually his listeners warmed to him	2044.8718927083823
8926. their clapping grew more fervent;	the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for	him as a person	3267.8555372325072
8927. the worst was yet to come	43.26826077676371
8928. as andy	reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his	attention to the wings	2364.5489092400344
8929. rocco vecchio- a perspiring haggard vecchio-	was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored	transport guards	1872.8544983792358
8930. vecchio was nodding and pointing at the	large suitcase he held	752.5656760124511
8931. andy felt his heart thud heavily with	relief	167.11302700723377
8932. he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction	562.8452699455568
8933. the music	died away discordantly	14.934175529854912
8934. he drew a deep breath	22.274248481389193
8935. ladies and gentlemen	in place of my regular closing number tonight i'd like to sing	something of a different nature for you	2169.5080099438815
8936. ray if you please- the	'cradle song'	141.4978384733295
8937. he sensed rather than heard the gasp	that swept across the audience	640.132223508194
8938. nor could he blame them	22.265021380731127
8939. this particular	song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate	in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency	2459.906985926954
8940. having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone	for support	1418.7442302614088
8941. lullaby and goodnight h   his	voice shook	94.3513106901646
8942. for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway	through and had to cover up by humming the rest	3258.0787504988416
8943. he wondered if the	audience would let him finish	263.27098881889117
8944. they did; though contemptuous	they were still polite	246.2153615019926
8945. but when he was finally through their scorn	was made apparent	497.966403720335
8946. someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped	64.69850787269479
8947. otherwise the silence was complete	14.810670995234252
8948. as the lights came up andy	could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward	the exit	3037.835307911161
8949. my god he muttered	2.9668231106136913
8950. hub was there to support him	65.50658679594936
8951. the money's here all of it	43.00678048950215
8952. at this moment	all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo	1636.402273327372
8953. did	you hear them	2.939126176137536
8954. do you know what they think of me	247.12024056685686
8955. bunch of damn jerks hub growled	43.90477875138781
8956. who needs them	0.30041514999999996
8957. thornburg patted his arm	2.9536025461434914
8958. sure andy it'll be all right	64.96467999014791
8959. nothing broken that can't be mended	43.693303507238696
8960. thornburg	knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile	as humpty dumpty	2117.4847955019786
8961. all the king's horses and all the king's	men h   vecchio shouldered in	791.5977731598831
8962. god knows	how but i got it	140.48748709077347
8963. you'll never believe the places i've been	today	168.53011920361655
8964. i practically had to sign your life away you'll probably fire	me for some of the deals i had to go for but-   andy	nodded dully	4083.262826585942
8965. we've done our part	2.943030022820492
8966. he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing	room	1185.493756575343
8967. the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent;	the place had the air of a morgue	1103.3817031445324
8968. andy had no desire to linger himself	but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the	efforts of the police to disperse them	4083.823210086467
8969. his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of	sight then hurried after	1576.720647456222
8970. he caught	up with the old man in the living room	758.0332656763032
8971. old man arthur had put down	the suitcase to open the front door	795.6450960226682
8972. just this one favor	dad	22.356851730180985
8973. just don't tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours	260.2249123591411
8974. why not	0.30041514999999996
8975. the old man gave the room a stare in leaving; under	the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory	2337.56248684196
8976. the bartlett girl was killed by	mr dronk's son	390.5174325414615
8977. rossi and ferguson have been across the street	talking to the kid	643.7834987614222
8978. they've found some sort of new evidence a bundle	of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger	to the crime	3693.658113744641
8979. why won't you accept facts	15.0004925883436
8980. the two kids were together	a lot they were having some kind of teen-age affair- god knows	how far that had gone- and the kid's crippled	4079.093951330051
8981. he limps and the	man who hit you and took the cane he limped	942.2456036720223
8982. my god how much	more do you want	251.44069506692125
8983. his father looked him over closely	43.80707184108981
8984. you	sound like an old woman	65.73008942630274
8985. you should have gone to work today 'stead	of sneaking around spying on the dronk house	1256.5959895644016
8986. now	see here-   the trouble with you old man arthur	began and then checked himself	1653.40280401557
8987. young mrs arthur had opened the	oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits	1263.5174462470768
8988. the old man opened	the door and stepped out into the sunlight	964.0215748728758
8989. isn't enough time	to go into it he finished and slammed the door in his son's face	1417.9954381314903
8990. mrs holden turned from the window draperies	142.17475480287024
8991. they	found something else up there she said half-aloud to the empty room	788.4353280629695
8992. they took it away overalls or something	141.2693096343234
8993. she walked restlessly	across the room then back to the windows	504.14140774674763
8994. now they've gone	they didn't come back and they didn't arrest that dronk boy	1405.56250036724
8995. she stood frowning and chewing her lip	93.2938722420332
8996. she was wearing a brown cotton	dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her	look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below	5166.967147117323
8997. she	smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows	1099.1765565847259
8998. why on earth did i send him off to work	562.0294107508964
8999. there was excuse	enough to keep him home h that young mr arthur's still over	there	1253.233407921921
9000. with sudden energy she went to the phone and rang	holden's office and asked for him	1889.979931833905
9001. i think you had better	come home	94.15874427144703
9002. mr crosson's	been on everybody's neck an order he expected didn't come through	and he's-   i don't care	2364.2895709876066
9003. i'm	all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous	793.5948721901393
9004. i	need someone to go out and find out what's happening	744.9895303277297
9005. but	i couldn't do that even if i were home! his voice grew	high and trembling	1258.1013173555034
9006. i can't be underfoot every time those cops turn	around! they'll h they'll think i did something	2126.0894083837866
9007. he couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the teeth that	shone into the phone were like a shark's	1887.409612851366
9008. you'll just have	to risk it	64.69697571812529
9009. you can't wander along in the dark can you	264.2286566864934
9010. i'd	think that you h even more than i h would be wondering what they're	up to	2132.1379331775925
9011. they found some clothes she tossed in	94.10507533521817
9012. what	0.30041514999999996
9013. deliberately she ignored the yelp	14.809518923997027
9014. also that mr	ferguson was here	65.05564350406505
9015. i guess he wants to ask you some questions	262.4739916278625
9016. he doesn't expect you until five	65.34081944864877
9017. then	i'd better wait until five	43.501126059161095
9018. no h o h o	22.324398790417447
9019. she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped	away	376.40039247570974
9020. her eyes were bright with anticipation	65.61406911245004
9021. in his office	mr holden replaced the phone slowly	261.8737767894162
9022. he rose from his chair	22.132900718945194
9023. he had to cough then; he went to the window and choked there with	the fresh breeze on his face	1892.5498694734458
9024. he got his hat out of the closet	250.36259249542027
9025. for	a moment he thought of going into crosson's office to explain that	he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a	pounding in his head that he decided to let it go	4207.926085108238
9026. he passed the receptionist	in the outer office muttering i've got to go out for	a little while	2366.9216375422357
9027. let her call crosson if she wanted to let crosson	raise the roof or even can him he didn't care	1886.7544767638021
9028. he got into	the car	22.464838530157323
9029. putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator	with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost	beyond the ability of his shaking body	2989.742116291661
9030. once out in the street	the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken	1897.1642852563684
9031. when he	turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then	rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few	minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear	them of tears	4750.637140855052
9032. what on earth was in mae's mind that she wanted	him up there spying on what the cops were doing	2811.7661918197637
9033. what did she	think he could do	94.7864741018958
9034. he tried to ignore what his own common sense	told him but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant	2803.374802551748
9035. she wanted him to get into trouble	93.35979509678538
9036. she wanted the police to notice	him suspect him	393.6772726371635
9037. she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding	suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in	him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions	3337.3758250152014
9038. and he knew	in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hopes	that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors	4645.524340064845
9039. nothing bald open; but enough	14.722791910061819
9040. they'd have some suspicions to repeat	to the police	394.56730558007536
9041. though his inner thoughts cringed at it	he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed	to have caught him molesting the child	2853.2249258517654
9042. it hadn't amounted	to anything	22.132898586753317
9043. there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions	373.4177744253069
9044. a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of	the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled	to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then	the brightness as mae had clicked on the light	7087.71276958579
9045. suppose the	cops somehow got hold of that	167.62522795434444
9046. well it hadn't been	what it seemed he'd had no idea the girl was in there	1875.6608643453305
9047. and when he came to examine the scene there was	a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift	suspicion darted into his mind	3109.219605150149
9048. mae	wouldn't have plotted a thing like that	251.48507390799028
9049. it was just that little	accidents played into her hands	371.18993838876156
9050. he leaned	on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring	order into his thoughts	2598.715256637025
9051. he felt light-headed and sick	14.904335398496414
9052. there was	no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare	962.9700411199419
9053. she was married to him for better or for worse	375.2410762493977
9054. she wouldn't	be wilfully planning his destruction	140.22782718833952
9055. even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering	his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake	to head up the road for home doing her bidding	3556.9248190192448
9056. he drove and the	road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side	1191.9649114028143
9057. he came to a	stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted	and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses	2860.4530371828064
9058. he had	the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to	hide	1884.7021333244734
9059. but he couldn't imagine where	14.944540537139128
9060. there was really no place to	go finally except home to mae	964.9779150833295
9061. at the gate he slowed looking	around	93.95140284626068
9062. cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just	standing there morosely; he didn't even look up	2829.4518437613942
9063. behind him on the	steps of the little office sat old man arthur; he was straight	something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report	something	3225.4754778087377
9064. holden stepped on the gas	22.409711879470514
9065. a new idea drifted in from	nowhere	94.07944331878296
9066. he could go to the police	65.56508317638685
9067. he could tell them his fears	of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood	and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him-	the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his	own jerkings	and snivelings and ferguson's silent patience	5166.6798454497075
9068. he could throw	himself on the mercy of the police department	752.6058191008907
9069. it wasn't	what mae would want him to do though	376.9406178153666
9070. he was sure of this	22.044598517911627
9071. once	he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all	the dragons of worry and suspense there wouldn't be very much for	mae to do	3108.864886214903
9072. at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go	back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about	2822.5766616286833
9073. it would be	such a relief	43.78503163229805
9074. what was that old sign supposed to be painted	over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here	2798.2651564828316
9075. why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight	i'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can	be	2728.5994415414143
9076. they've worried they've lain awake nights they've shook	at the slightest footstep they've pictured their own destruction and	now it's all over and they can give up	4279.885979506244
9077. sure they're giving up	hope	14.895502811143041
9078. hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension	757.1476446089298
9079. holden waved a hand at the empty street	167.64263075766058
9080. glad to	see you go	22.55534262956497
9081. he drove into the paved space before the garage	and got out slamming the car door	1265.9493910580995
9082. he looked up and down the street	142.38390045356434
9083. if ferguson's car had been in sight holden would have walked	directly to it	943.9724980391736
9084. he went to the front door and opened it and looked	in	959.847953434748
9085. mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen	378.16314078417184
9086. she had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a	fresh piece of toast in the other	2802.5365779194017
9087. she stood there watching holden	come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner	with a huge chomp of her white teeth	3224.0903909667877
9088. mae-	i've been thinking she said swallowing the toast	392.54699812033266
9089. didn't	you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage	644.5426101076902
9090. you	used them that time you painted the porch at our other house	1185.273247871852
9091. and then	you wiped up some grease	93.97147493071301
9092. she had caught him off guard	no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster	2358.161122370566
9093. what do you-   i've been	looking for them and they're gone	501.805911585547
9094. i'm sure they were in the garage	up until a couple of days ago	1405.1446980416483
9095. you used to paint	in them and then you just took them for rags	939.1475759942248
9096. the police have them	now	22.193811857426702
9097. i don't remember any overalls at all	93.02526285930438
9098. worn through at the knees	22.26736817231525
9099. she stood sipping	and chewing and watching	93.73864303885496
9100. green paint wasn't it	4.39894529706599
9101. well	i'm not sure of the color	93.39944052372707
9102. mae	sit down	0.30041514999999996
9103. put down the cup of coffee	42.97860644271499
9104. tell me what this is all about	140.73587491294856
9105. she took another bite of toast	43.30138728113775
9106. holden	noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her	cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck	3872.052587668746
9107. my goodness	you ought to remember if i do	263.1885386806047
9108. you're going to have to go	to the police and explain what happened	1185.79959165928
9109. tell them the truth h or	something h before they come here	646.1928541018112
9110. a seeping coldness entered	holden's being; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips	of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable	to break like an icicle at any moment	5457.808216552142
9111. i've never owned any	painting overalls	43.3731541809891
9112. a man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small	office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper	and said is this more like it mrs macready	6456.163875275645
9113. or are	the eyebrows more like this	93.92391006475461
9114. when he had finished with that he	would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to	someone else most probably a busboy	4478.670049362669
9115. begin to look like him now	would you say	264.91005155035225
9116. different about the mouth huh	22.28683101614405
9117. more like this	maybe	2.9701200049859535
9118. men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth	floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same	in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties	6073.485923693043
9119. and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once	more	947.086239341035
9120. men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct	had the longest the most tedious job	1654.9076714470607
9121. at the hotel dumont	there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting	couples as singular	1573.5599578589938
9122. these included as one mr and mrs	anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before	and had not checked out together	4106.5768423671725
9123. but gardner willings was not	included; he had been at the dumont for almost a week	1257.176951059774
9124. there was	of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought	had stayed only overnight at the hotel	3487.0146630573013
9125. the twenty-three	provided merely a place to	start and their identification was the barest of starts	1262.4367656449654
9126. with names	and addresses listed verification came next	249.3458282283369
9127. it would take time;	it would almost inevitably trouble some water	499.77530071612034
9128. not at the dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been	963.4416852583212
9129. he's	the hotel king	arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems	948.3972691185996
9130. the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people	from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want- heaven	knew didn't want!- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets	to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations	to distant homes probably through rain or in november something	worse	7949.578694669707
9131. the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont	260.1152890256741
9132. the	king arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather	than people	961.9778154701186
9133. failing to find	what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special-	but not exclusive- attention to those with rooms on the street	2846.2750220285884
9134. and	know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose	that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel	3872.9949201507225
9135. it was not even	certain the shot had been fired from either hotel	799.5822612895554
9136. there were other	roofs less convenient but not impossible	391.78642240690976
9137. it is dull business detecting	and hard on feet	260.7013180022709
9138. there was also the one salient question	to ask and ask widely: did you notice anything out of the way	2818.6295290656867
9139. like for example a man carrying a twenty-two rifle probably with	a telescopic sight attached	1108.4231723380076
9140. there was of course no hope	it really would be that simple	963.3251764852109
9141. the sniper whether psychopathic marksman	or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point	with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune	2607.0703783880317
9142. anybody carrying	anything that might hide a rifle	249.93073006944337
9143. long thin suitcase	0.20041515
9144. or long	fat suitcase for that matter	140.30765458886862
9145. shrugs met that from room clerks	from bellhops	168.61197016342084
9146. who measures	0.30041514999999996
9147. but nothing it appeared long enough	to attract attention	259.0735048454539
9148. cases say for musical instruments	22.233371822833426
9149. none	noted at the dumont	14.915225274401488
9150. several at the king arthur	22.395280226216247
9151. a combo was staying	there	14.83906986257704
9152. and had been for a week	65.46934375902018
9153. anything else	0.20041515
9154. anything at	all	0.30041514999999996
9155. shrugs met that	0.20041515
9156. thought for a time he might be on to something	559.1965553561292
9157. a refuse bin at	the dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long box for very	long-stemmed flowers	1734.5542069745352
9158. traces of oil on green tissue	65.0245695860674
9159. the lab to check	2.9564505422247036
9160. anything at all strange	4.403518100873635
9161. well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with	an ocelot	947.0184063081808
9162. at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair	964.415194981204
9163. at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged	and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches	2340.4648195581785
9164. there	had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because	he kept jerking his head	2828.3180958531893
9165. as reports dribbled in william	weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head	1267.0543025070588
9166. there was no sign of mrs lauren payne at her	house on nod road ridgefield connecticut	1875.6480965390376
9167. the house was modern	large on five acres	166.74592288162302
9168. the state cops would	check from time to time; pass word when there was word to pass	2119.9960510046967
9169. weigand	tossed this news into the centrifuge	94.86224117431328
9170. sort things out damn it	22.073500932534294
9171. sort out the next move	14.72311043279457
9172. try to forget motive for the moment	140.66220241507853
9173. only those actually with payne when he was shot	or who had left the party within not more than five minutes	positively had none	2462.4280451742898
9174. the norths; hathaway jerry's	publicity director; livingston birdwood producer of uprising	747.1401117782636
9175. they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore	have shot him from above	1419.0855177618018
9176. he had	left after the scuffle; had been seen to leave	754.420497253587
9177. he would have had ample	time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey	1267.5284735974794
9178. consider him	seriously therefore	4.443889292160432
9179. intangibles entered then- hunches which	felt like facts	167.67086790963606
9180. willings would ambush certainly; willings undoubtedly	had	141.69142600735913
9181. willings was presumably a better than average shot	166.77641302970295
9182. but-	hunch now- willings would not ambush anything which went on two	legs instead of four	1887.4381085122798
9183. because if for no other reason willings would	never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything	else that went on two legs	2722.2004627464944
9184. ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves	as any man may against a tiger	1633.5010543762346
9185. faith constable had	had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on	1106.0327073495332
9186. to	be checked out further	22.242401629126057
9187. forget motive	0.20041515
9188. no motive is a part of fact	140.0669725255275
9189. nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction	263.93527931641296
9190. grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind	751.4838895765345
9191. faith constable	had accomplished much in a quarter of a century	501.70776254786085
9192. jeopardize it now	to correct so old a wrong	396.55764192570086
9193. bill shook his head	2.9697231753747992
9194. also he thought	i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun	2130.509151990017
9195. lauren herself	0.20041515
9196. she had left the party early pleading a headache	390.7130216915724
9197. no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun	263.69458111129774
9198. she might conceivably	have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase	756.0072004514216
9199. she might now have taken it away again	165.73247265886772
9200. motive- her	husband wandering	4.41810438853338
9201. bitter unreasoning jealousy	0.20041515
9202. heaven knew	it happened and hell knew it too	390.87656895551186
9203. but- it happened almost always	among the primitive and usually among the very young	945.5120607466375
9204. there was nothing to indicate that lauren	payne was primitive	556.3042323929728
9205. she did not move in primitive circles	93.02412362306987
9206. she	was young but not that young	140.32246774498657
9207. it occurred to bill weigand	that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many	1259.2504119090765
9208. he reminded	himself that all eliminations were tentative	249.29466883238348
9209. he also reminded himself	that he had an unusual number of possibilities	640.3223357765467
9210. the masons	mother or son or mother and son	394.2458793100092
9211. opportunity was obvious	0.20041515
9212. here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years	960.6263014440194
9213. but	bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode	503.6676730534282
9214. the boy had apparently- if mrs macready	was right in what she had told mullins- only in recent months	been forced to give up college to work as a busboy	4825.718516537897
9215. seeing the man	he blamed for this made much of- youth and bitterness and-	bill picked up the telephone; got mullins	2024.0088582951098
9216. send out a	pickup on mrs mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on	bill said	2595.763281369398
9217. a	man named lars simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that	anthony payne drop dead	1102.2782090019787
9218. he would say of course that he had not	really had any such wish; that what he had said was no more than one	of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing	5325.073925010743
9219. which probably	would turn out to be true; which he obviously had to be given the	opportunity to say	1723.534419370367
9220. a man named blaine smythe with y	and e but pronounced without them had been fired at payne's	insistence	2578.662302801023
9221. he was also if pam north was right a closer acquaintance	of lauren payne's than she now was inclined to admit	2024.9535533566261
9222. he might deny the latter; would certainly deny any connection between	the two things or any connection of either with murder	3041.1393992722637
9223. he would	have to be given the opportunity	167.1674923951915
9224. mullins	0.30041514999999996
9225. it was evident	that mullins was the man to go	372.5110446479192
9226. it was evident that a captain should	remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat	3041.1308283670087
9227. bill weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack	in the plaster	1254.3180771156979
9228. let mullins keep the firm seat; let stein	249.30366422393735
9229. when siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where	one leaves off and another begins	1414.7279652841903
9230. stilts and shadow on pam's	bed appeared to be one cat- rather large as siamese cats go and	to be sure having two heads and two tails	4294.647661386634
9231. on the other hand they	or it seemed to have no legs whatever	785.9336404039096
9232. pamela north said hi	to her cats and added that proper cats met their humans at the door	2362.018944946595
9233. of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this	375.2065861816616
9234. i know it isn't dinnertime	22.3078047003316
9235. but at	this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats stretching	643.4089766892124
9236. shadow	the more talkative began at once to talk her voice piteous	957.7845885205355
9237. stilts	a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward	the kitchen	1103.9386377878657
9238. shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her	249.10005583972566
9239. the hell it isn't dinnertime two waving tails told pam north	499.9125119064173
9240. it was not whatever tale was told by tails	390.9043393360836
9241. she might be firm	2.957591182272109
9242. it was most unlikely that she would	be firm	392.49086955707975
9243. they want to be fat cats pam thought and lighted a cigarette	and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together	2474.391014990807
9244. after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth	the trouble	1632.0193517458397
9245. a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming	was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible	1879.3703899221618
9246. had faith	constable's explanation of her confidence so uninvited been a	little thin	1180.8536696626165
9247. that was more like a thought but not a great deal more	645.7087215669198
9248. had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what	he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more	than he could bear	4654.823241689588
9249. and possessed himself- how	2.939363123655628
9250. - of a rifle	and killed	10.838946344799817
9251. pam found she had no answers; had only a hope	380.0222734212499
9252. the poor	kid- the poor frail kid	141.35747033858922
9253. some people have luck and some have no	luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of	it	2176.4389112431036
9254. the poor unlucky-   the telephone rang	65.13014572859515
9255. pam realized to	her surprise that she had been almost dozing	500.78977658562405
9256. at four o'clock in	the afternoon	64.92872960326443
9257. two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble	165.75042454385255
9258. you do remember	0.30041514999999996
9259. you just- hello	0.20041515
9260. yes this is she	4.43138654972408
9261. what	0.20041515
9262. the voice had music	in it	64.78666787152488
9263. even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the	voice	943.9233347377345
9264. i said i would pam said	65.38456489544349
9265. they won't talk	about who gave the information	166.43499955280618
9266. not unless they have to	22.1221031204409
9267. not unless they have-   she was	interrupted	93.11434269648026
9268. call this a cry for help faith constable	said	389.1437849732342
9269. through a door conveniently unlocked madden supplemented	93.7045251776303
9270. that damn door said the police chief	141.19526566559858
9271. a gift horse	to be viewed with suspicion	166.194634622242
9272. madden's dark face wore a meditative	look	142.968817645559
9273. if there was collusion between an outside murderer and	a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check	on the door later	2725.678626569835
9274. and it makes a very poor red herring for an inside	job	963.4891320630175
9275. much better to break a cellar window	94.5769739034996
9276. don't	forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling	reminded him	1888.623465485586
9277. well with a house as big as that there	must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away	unless there was a police investigation	2986.866505204653
9278. and a	pane of glass isn't hard to-   the telephone interrupted	him	956.251589203546
9279. he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into	the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson	1583.3748224921296
9280. i was hoping i'd	hear from you today	252.44074440325008
9281. with his free hand he pulled a pad	and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying	uh-huh and i see at intervals	2861.02878278994
9282. at last he said	well thank you for calling mr benson	752.0181498392292
9283. although there was	no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one i'm glad	to have it made official	2178.3828581300536
9284. coroner he said	to madden	22.126821285970944
9285. he's just heard from the pathologist who says mrs	meeker apparently died from suffocation	947.0432870181737
9286. pauling looked at his	notes	22.140103830921795
9287. many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles of lint	and thread in the mouth and nostrils	1260.6899896686323
9288. scrapings from the bed linen	identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities	2360.882873810701
9289. no other cause of death apparent	43.104006394823706
9290. trachea clear of mucus and foreign	objects	141.04413461959865
9291. brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage	94.07648794639181
9292. no signs	of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach	1181.5612650893067
9293. oh the time of death	14.757726276866995
9294. the duration	of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty	stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate	that mrs meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock	dinner	5331.448425454283
9295. probably around midnight give or take an hour either way	376.6223746155074
9296. so there it is he said	65.3124437580338
9297. not	your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one	and the same	1104.1660597487921
9298. however likely	it was pauling said he couldn't limit himself to it	950.2236452190394
9299. he had	to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence	pointing to johnston came to light	1730.934701274163
9300. madden with his investigation	centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the bronx	bank through which mrs meeker's checks to johnston had cleared	4305.002380559619
9301. arthur williams had to be located they agreed	165.4624590368756
9302. he might	have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud; he might be mrs	meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death	3890.3294495157616
9303. this	was madden's suggestion; the police chief shook his head over it	641.7978767889608
9304. if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he	too had another identity	2134.6098509506237
9305. no one the medfield police had questioned	professed to know any more about him than about johnston	1418.7148653649115
9306. scholarship	applicant	0.30041514999999996
9307. pauling looked doubtful	0.20041515
9308. madden explained that	he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs meeker	1407.9882517416745
9309. then he asked to use the phone and called brian thayer who said that	he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two	o'clock	3207.591659721814
9310. madden said that he would see him at two and made another	call this one to mrs meeker's lawyers	2601.3634686333507
9311. mr hohlbein	was out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty	1097.21295267595
9312. the	secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice	was a concession for which madden should be duly grateful	3039.152631130627
9313. he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high-priced lawyers	261.7254904369262
9314. he had lunch with pauling	22.058571594112383
9315. promptly at one-thirty he entered hohlbein	and garth's elegant suite of offices in medfield's newest	professional building	1411.1633753347057
9316. he disliked garth on sight conservative	clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man	who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and	firm	5014.115404899208
9317. youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready	to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner	of the firm had political ambitions; that mrs garth would be	impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there	were three children two boys and a girl; that she was active in the	woman's club and he in lions rotary and jaycee; and finally	that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their	wedding day	0.20124717349522497
9318. madden knew that he could be completely wrong about	all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth	3273.2689407620983
9319. garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with	fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would	not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker	had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it	4689.932392424132
9320. madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement	1178.8048992568617
9321. he asked to see a copy of mrs meeker's will	376.57020972572326
9322. the date october 8 1957 immediately caught	the inspector's eye	563.1820533006661
9323. was she	in the habit of making new wills	259.9148039201981
9324. oh no	0.30041514999999996
9325. she had reason	to change the one she made right after mr meeker's death	946.9592685707746
9326. her	estate had grown considerably	22.114026753558754
9327. she wanted to make a more equitable	distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most; particularly	the scholarship fund	2183.327401810954
9328. at the time the will was drawn mr	hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age	knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth	4835.013710070407
9329. mr hohlbein and i have noticed some lapses since	though	375.7519940299207
9330. most of them this past year i'd say	249.76518172634525
9331. even two or three	years ago i doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate	johnston affair	1573.1843239160933
9332. she'd have consulted us you see	65.70395132226459
9333. she always	did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised	789.8542635454893
9334. the inspector nodded doubting this	22.124399190175097
9335. mrs meeker hadn't	struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise least of all garth's	1097.9039763507703
9336. with her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons	749.8704027995957
9337. it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs	258.8373705507696
9338. madden	settled back to read the will	140.40023928732947
9339. he skimmed over the millions	that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center	the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing	when he came to the scholarship fund	3557.5020848633417
9340. two millions were added to	what had been set aside for it in mrs meeker's lifetime and	the proviso made that as long as brian thayer continued to discharge	his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board	of trustees	he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate	with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would	entail	8768.259334545926
9341. a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden	reflected	259.4106875303748
9342. he went on to personal	bequests a list of names largely unknown to him	1420.5268531316246
9343. twenty-five thousand	to each of the great-nieces in oregon	ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand	to another; to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars;	to the pecks ten thousand each; to joan sheldon the conditional	bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was	still in mrs meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death	5801.171542228175
9344. birthday; mrs meeker hadn't got around to taking care	too bad madden thought	1186.9487131324483
9345. joan sheldon had earned	the larger bequest	93.30716063132719
9346. mr hohlbein was left twenty thousand	garth ten	249.74527747076345
9347. there were no other names madden recognized	93.31458661132316
9348. arthur williams's	might well have been included he felt	388.8427001292175
9349. mrs meeker had	spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for	him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never	mentioned his name to her lawyers	4145.847766126894
9350. madden took up this point	with garth who shrugged it off	746.817750978327
9351. old people have their idiosyncrasies	14.920951988986577
9352. this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more	757.1074691202746
9353. well she had a number of them where money was concerned	garth said	784.1428144894958
9354. sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to	make tax-exempt charitable contributions and i've known her to quarrel	with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment	she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty	thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston	affair	7542.165245451087
9355. there was no telling how she'd react to spending money	372.4100885756142
9356. madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund	564.310469784197
9357. there was an annual audit garth informed him	167.24958788825137
9358. no discrepancies	or shortages had ever been found	249.47792287908842
9359. brian thayer was a thoroughly	honest and competent administrator	263.1951955601934
9360. his salary had reached the ten thousand	mark	249.22015569458554
9361. his expenses ran another four or five thousand	167.4850532453019
9362. the lawyer	didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some	dinner party- thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra	man so prized by hostesses- and found him easy enough to talk to	5925.666981828503
9363. but he didn't play golf didn't seem to belong to any local clubs-	his work took him away a lot of course- which probably accounted	for his tendency to keep to himself	3428.238603392966
9364. garth's glance began	to flicker to his watch	249.43137010549245
9365. he said that he had already told the	police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended	johnston to mrs meeker	2322.503656601879
9366. he would offer no theory to account	for her murder	561.3301705228248
9367. the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside	the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded	being swept under the rug	2726.499053619787
9368. no doubt mrs meeker had	snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing	2362.5102117760557
9369. even so	madden's dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened	376.93016062695204
9370. it would	be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud	with its probable by-product of murder led to garth's door	3885.7202370762207
9371. at first glance not much of a motive	for a man of his standing; but for all his air of affluence who	could tell what his private financial picture was	3194.8005870576844
9372. the inspector	knew as he left that this was wishful thinking	750.617052608162
9373. nevertheless	he made a mental note to look into garth's financial background	646.179314580342
9374. brian thayer had a downtown address	65.05282364726989
9375. he lived in an apartment	house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped	brick and glass on the fringe of the business district	2999.2135221572776
9376. he	occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second	bedroom as his office	1902.6868042406902
9377. airy and bright the apartment was furnished	with good modern furniture rugs and draperies	946.6165183763958
9378. done by a professional	decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable	as its occupant	1895.7303312579224
9379. in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred	a month; in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it	paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account	3650.4081401588674
9380. he took madden into the room he used as an office	764.8189993389408
9381. it contained	a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs	1100.8134376264957
9382. a newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them	752.581433984344
9383. thayer	folded it up and offered a drink	168.0121081652241
9384. to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think	it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston	4294.419998820148
9385. it's all i think about too	43.75991587460429
9386. it's still unbelievable that it was murder	140.0324148788614
9387. for	all her domineering ways i can't conceive of her having had a deadly	enemy	1105.2185685202458
9388. dammit phil are you trying to wreck my career	394.4999199133202
9389. because	that's what you're doing- wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it!	griffith had confronted hoag on the building's front steps-	hoag had been permitted no further- and backed him against a wrought-iron	railing	3570.579276074878
9390. his rage had built up as he made his way here from	the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed	3698.740196781136
9391. hoag said i didn't send for you leigh	167.0566639739056
9392. i want the	captain in charge	65.2618623473006
9393. where is he	0.20041515
9394. phil for god's sake	go away	65.59709022489494
9395. i told you there's	nothing between midge and me nothing	371.80385391727765
9396. it's all in your mind	22.355117586601764
9397. a	couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his	emotional state	1098.2655479118896
9398. why i'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment	754.9494278844037
9399. leigh get a grip on yourself	43.519624879228914
9400. it's not about you	or midge	65.96616816736083
9401. i have some security information about the prime minister	263.13779487786474
9402. griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed	eyes	251.61728063790488
9403. not about me	0.20041515
9404. you mean it phil	4.410561336717837
9405. you wouldn't pull	my leg old man	93.90427860897154
9406. i did get you on the platform this morning	394.1545021263139
9407. i'm not pulling your leg	14.852609181267875
9408. will you call that captain	22.236706711768008
9409. no use he won't come	14.87262530576831
9410. he peered closely at hoag	in the gathering darkness	390.1409892236054
9411. what happened to your head	14.863945326499433
9412. i was hit- knocked out	22.192008598978326
9413. now will you get him	14.806470797952239
9414. he	says i'm to take the message	140.016114117395
9415. he stared at hoag drunkenly	14.701191784805065
9416. who'd hit you in the head	65.46623116375557
9417. it doesn't matter	0.20041515
9418. you get back to the captain and tell him this: somebody's going	to take a shot at the prime minister and mahzeer is in on the plot	4303.25751768653
9419. tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer	644.9614851228728
9420. mahzeer's	the ambassador	0.30041514999999996
9421. griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne	fuzz that encased it	936.2169060022885
9422. i'll show you how wrong you are	141.83421625536522
9423. mahzeer	and the prime minister are alone right now	263.6291426924057
9424. so that proves it!   hoag looked terrified	140.06799051218985
9425. where	are they	0.20041515
9426. where'd you expect the john	22.35624222543105
9427. mahzeer's	office	0.20041515
9428. where is that	0.30041514999999996
9429. facing us	two flights up	14.818837944561448
9430. look old man you can't go up	142.09034206582996
9431. they won't even	let you in the front door	262.33657257305674
9432. so why don't you be a good boy and-	hoag grabbed him by the shoulders	1652.13369659539
9433. if you want to spend another day in the state department- another	day- you get in there and tell that captain what i told you	2583.307784679861
9434. he bit out the words	22.471008715492864
9435. and you know i can do it	94.27112848322665
9436. easy does it phil	4.410561336717837
9437. i'm on my way	2.9381841544345955
9438. he turned and fled into the house and made	his way up the marble stairs without once looking back	2596.554913285611
9439. on the second	landing he paused to look for docherty didn't see him and accepted	a glass of champagne	1737.2012315202762
9440. he took several large swallows recollected	that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise	to cover himself by finding him	3890.931106667729
9441. the way hoag was no telling what	he might say or do	645.7443856351246
9442. he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly	to the next landing	754.6542496862276
9443. at the top a uniformed officer blocked further	progress	263.4981623703408
9444. yes what is it	4.39894529706599
9445. he asked	0.20041515
9446. he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far	end of the corridor and called to him	2588.208444777418
9447. docherty said it's	okay bonfiglio let him by	166.25648235136504
9448. they walked toward each other	22.215140136271792
9449. well	0.20041515
9450. griffith said hoag told me to tell you-	he waited until they were close; it was hideously embarrassing-	not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer	4437.609589178179
9451. griffith	looked half-crocked to the captain; it would be just like him	646.4313223171779
9452. why not	0.30041514999999996
9453. he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill	the pm	377.3101289275361
9454. docherty went taut: was it possible	64.76259231108592
9455. could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister	feared	941.6096264888168
9456. not possible he thought; the prime minister knew who	his enemy was here; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly	to the slaughter	4077.878893342708
9457. and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man	he wouldn't dare try anything now- not after docherty had looked	in on the two of them to see that all was well	3545.58321865646
9458. docherty was damned	if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over	the laundry truck	3067.7574137916067
9459. one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd	be leading him away	788.4183696404745
9460. still this had to be checked out	139.70736203345092
9461. where'd	your friend hoag get his information	92.83878819439566
9462. he asked	0.30041514999999996
9463. would you mind	sending him up here	94.34459713546224
9464. i'd like to talk to him	65.29347717084784
9465. troubled he continued	along the corridor poking his head into the next office for	a careful look around	1591.9688584512137
9466. but hoag had not stayed on the front	steps when griffith disappeared into the building	1658.0779615446668
9467. he was unwilling	to rely on griffith's carrying his message and he had no confidence	the police would act on it	2043.5334945689017
9468. if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister	he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here	shivering in the darkening street	3683.040870744729
9469. he would have to do something on his	own	262.7891708048019
9470. but what	0.30041514999999996
9471. the door opened and three men and a woman	in a sari swept past him and down the stairs	1742.7559912592315
9472. in the lighted interior	he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps	1424.7748857726156
9473. these were	the early departures; in half an hour the reception would be over	947.645976170561
9474. if	mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would	have to do it in the next few minutes	3479.376002427485
9475. hoag descended the stone	steps to the street and looked up at the building	946.8461164773968
9476. wide windows with	many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories	962.9816502734824
9477. on the second	floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests; the scene looked	like a christmas card	1893.591135579405
9478. on the third floor one of the two windows	was lighted; it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible	3259.984651857083
9479. this would be mahzeer's office	14.92807896593539
9480. he and the prime minister would	be back from the window seated at mahzeer's desk; they would	be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting	5025.027598887741
9481. in a minute or five minutes the business would be done; mahzeer	would stand up the prime minister would follow	1895.3437182071016
9482. mahzeer would direct	the prime minister's attention to something out the window and	would guide him forward and then step to one side	3498.3622092013916
9483. the single shot would	come; hoag would carry its sound to his grave	791.5797486953232
9484. mahzeer of course	would be desolate	65.08580527070578
9485. how was he to suspect that an assassin had been	lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance	2028.3959451061041
9486. hoag turned	0.30041514999999996
9487. where across the street	2.974051328094512
9488. where was muller	waiting with the rifle	141.1609896812672
9489. narrow four-story buildings ran the length	of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf	1262.3874945065706
9490. most of them could	be eliminated; muller's would have to be one of the half dozen	almost directly opposite	2583.713281162651
9491. the legation was generously set back from	the building line; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings	on either side would interfere	2737.536656604918
9492. would the shot come from a roof	141.6362273691894
9493. he ran his eye along the roof copings; almost at once a figure	bulked up	1096.7348745509769
9494. but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and	badge of a policeman	1649.202368928863
9495. with a cop patrolling the road muller would	have to be inside a building- if he was here at all and not waiting	for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal	building at la guardia airport	4139.621480758875
9496. hoag crossed the narrow street	squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk	1179.2394112804054
9497. from this	side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window but	he saw no faces; the room's occupants were still seated or they	had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain	3883.965357525894
9498. if only	the latter were true h	140.2832115882295
9499. he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning	their facades: one was a club- that was out; two others he	ruled out because all their windows were lighted	2855.7829454418634
9500. that left three possibly	four one looking much like the next	756.182096517156
9501. he climbed the steps of	the first and opened the door to the vestibule	941.1658729740969
9502. he quickly closed it	again	22.0948116893245
9503. he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into	apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was	obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence;	that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans	had to be made in advance	5209.234127132979
9504. he went on to the next building and	found what he expected- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule	2820.9231185994804
9505. on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes; there	were six apartments	1251.4335527236453
9506. now what	0.30041514999999996
9507. the names on the mailboxes meant	nothing to him	261.7757658534721
9508. this was senseless- he had no idea what to look for	752.2769913280646
9509. he peered in the boxes themselves; all were empty except one and	that one was jammed with letters and magazines	1879.1819069319731
9510. the occupants of apartment	number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to	return on a friday	3031.482368916681
9511. had muller made the same deduction	43.58247252487813
9512. muller	was attracted to the lore of mailboxes	248.67905101361353
9513. he opened the inner door;	the cooking	odors were stronger- all over the city at this hour housewives	would be fussing over stoves	2321.823954430043
9514. he climbed as quickly as he could urge	his body up the two unbroken flights to the third floor pulling	himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remained of the building's	beauty	5338.89273766503
9515. he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and	then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb	overhead	2609.8079468400197
9516. now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to muller's	collection of keys; fresh scars showed that the door had been	prized open	3697.7962339841056
9517. it had been shut again but the lock was broken; he noted	with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch	2460.7310425669984
9518. what was he to do now	65.48901193530996
9519. he had thought no further than finding muller	169.03947677597452
9520. he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find	him- that muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled	for somewhere beyond hoag's control	4835.630952758688
9521. he could not break in on	an armed man	259.91176057421023
9522. he would have to climb back down to the street and signal	a cop	1416.460368782839
9523. was there time	0.20041515
9524. his thoughts were scattered by	the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door	2357.9268338613733
9525. hoag pushed	open the door: at the far end of the long dark room muller was	faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised; he stood	with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill	4298.640778434396
9526. he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back	to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment	with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoag's apartment	6078.64375118935
9527. hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled	for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark	1575.2018310615686
9528. the room was bathed in	light at the instant muller's second shot came	1182.8094239666548
9529. muller nakedly	exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights	threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face	wore a look of outrage	3581.677446585212
9530. a shot caught him and straightened him up in	screaming pain; a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped	the	ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table	4671.829219924621
9531. he was dead	before his body made contact with the floor	504.9846823307189
9532. hoag stumbled back into	the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch	1419.4989488033882
9533. after	captain docherty sent arleigh griffith for hoag he was able to	complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a	report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned	buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne	4678.025875396001
9534. the safe at ingleside district station stands next to the gum	machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain harris's office	the lieutenant's office	and the janitor's supply closet	4858.127199375407
9535. the	safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred	and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemen's	ball tickets from last year and thirty-seven cents in coins	and stamps	3768.1217592689327
9536. gun set the captain's fifth of hiram walker inside	the safe before he reported to lt killpath though he knew that	killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on	herman wolff's gift	5494.424393197473
9537. it was more a matter of tact and also it	was none of killpath's goddam business	1255.5949002891361
9538. he walked up to the	lieutenant's office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed	four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine	gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range	6086.580758376334
9539. he stared	at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing	envelopes	1255.965612203512
9540. where's the lieut	0.30041514999999996
9541. the clerk	wagged his head toward the captain's office	264.2123849595959
9542. gun went to the connecting	door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence	killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair	3673.2211346561935
9543. the lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as killpath	raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that	it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull	3551.563269875797
9544. the lieutenant	eyed gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then	glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his	head	4119.730804606769
9545. leave me alone gun thought	14.810198823302988
9546. fight with sam schaeffer	fight with the whole damned bureau	559.0925137065994
9547. because	i'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and i'm	going to get him	1871.6068132455462
9548. if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant	389.4404791463215
9549. killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection	thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced	1726.0028155090927
9550. gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window	1185.5527746704233
9551. he sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was	obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly	merited a swivel chair	3094.195222054764
9552. the desk before him was in no better repair	than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden	file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe	stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons	6444.185141891326
9553. killpath	pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press	his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut	2034.8120594551833
9554. it was the posture which the	men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer	2356.341940937531
9555. he	put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey	on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant	2600.8741583611454
9556. the 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside	doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch	2599.1011391651477
9557. finally	orville intoned through his hawk nose we can't have people running	in any time they please sergeant	1554.6395598655677
9558. can't have it	0.30041514999999996
9559. makes for confusion and	congestion	14.8803492454979
9560. he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach	his beady eyes fixed on matson	1887.266460382573
9561. he was silent again possibly	listening to the sounds in the squadroom	644.5441722373514
9562. gun cleared his throat	4.448539073481781
9563. killpath said you were expected	to report to	my office twenty minutes ago sergeant	938.9958911441256
9564. that's not getting	all the juice out of the orange now is it	1181.8380274383887
9565. no sir	0.20041515
9566. gun knew that nothing but aces back	to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time	3285.8457288869154
9567. the day-watch platoon commander lt rinker was calling	out the beat assignments but matson couldn't make the names mean	anything	1877.0180659931004
9568. i called the station at three this morning	killpath's nasal voice pronounced	956.0320952688904
9569. do you have any idea who might	have been in charge at the time	931.7258450911575
9570. sergeant vaughn	sir	0.30041514999999996
9571. now now you're just guessing sergeant	43.884022180397764
9572. he	smiled thinly savoring his joke	65.41174359651959
9573. what if i said nobody was here	but a couple of patrolmen	637.4251107547441
9574. sir vaughn knows better	than to leave the station without a relief	958.9804295504506
9575. he must have-	he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper	1098.8256102899409
9576. now	that's not regulation is it	64.8676112229316
9577. no sir	0.20041515
9578. but you didn't know a thing about it did you	563.8999455768229
9579. killpath leaned	forward; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again	frowning now	1417.851132330592
9580. that's not taking one's command with a responsible	attitude matson	562.9051555823655
9581. gun told himself that the old bastard	was a fool	373.6645158340609
9582. but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank	392.30037556753894
9583. i was out in the district sir	93.58015776355896
9584. he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers	on his desk	1175.8324895198234
9585. i might point out that your inability to report to	my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not h ah	h limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped	3941.9034215353518
9586. he took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data	966.1477482587154
9587. a car pulled into the driveway outside the window	264.885395840216
9588. gun knew it	was car 12 the wagon returned from delivering ingleside's	drunk-and-disorderlies	to the city jail	2124.404132373958
9589. but for some fool reason he couldn't	remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail	1260.0490049649404
9590. he stared	at the report in killpath's hand sure it was written by accacia-	just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand	4077.001996067664
9591. he	sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet	again wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and	then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting	lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station	keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire	watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts	of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide	detail of the inspector's bureau to arrogate for their own convenience	a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper	assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain	o t killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five	frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for	purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six-	he leaned back and peeled off his glasses - failed to co-operate	with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered	0.20124717349522497
9592. what	have you to say to that sergeant	248.54593441365654
9593. killpath sailed the paper	across the desk but matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it	1568.9827170644285
9594. well	0.30041514999999996
9595. i didn't think accacia knew so	many big words lieutenant	375.0535861363943
9596. patrolman	accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer	394.74095456493427
9597. i don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson	259.8682633148564
9598. negligence hell! gun held his breath a moment	pushing	the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his	throat	3484.1263025006947
9599. i would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to	boot if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got	away with murder in my district	3093.6790485633505
9600. it's too bad i didn't call you	and it's too bad i let schaeffer use accacia when he could have	had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure	5162.079967430144
9601. but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people	i know in the places they hang around and-   let's	not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath	nasaled	3751.536129841864
9602. i shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination	as well as dereliction of duty	2118.9546815327585
9603. gun stiffened his hands	balling into fists at his sides	372.08307541096616
9604. he clamped his jaws to keep the	fury from spilling out	753.7503920327772
9605. an argument with orville torrence killpath	was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range	1884.7824198869148
9606. killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms	still wrapped around one knee	1415.3705004070523
9607. let's just remember sergeant	that we must all carry our own umbrella	640.1614566331959
9608. a district station can't	run smoothly unless- he interrupted himself looking around gun	at the doorway	1884.9049978472988
9609. i thought you hadn't come in yet	93.20091108104545
9610. i've	been here for some time	65.19013597339179
9611. he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun	coldly	374.3991825787641
9612. the sergeant is just leaving	22.34088297030581
9613. it had come as	no great surprise to matson that the hot water in the showers didn't	work that loren severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that	some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes	4386.209748583837
9614. it	was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session	in killpath's office	2832.15563873868
9615. now as he passed the open counter	that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded	and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping	to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out	4219.013119437504
9616. not that he	gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about killpath's little speech	on the comportment of platoon commanders	3035.4272450799845
9617. he just didn't want	to talk about it	166.0053738941736
9618. if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant	to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just	have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour; because	he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just	to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain	7912.503692233241
9619. at the doorway he squinted	up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for	the cigarettes remembering then that he'd left them at the doughnuttery	2972.279381471458
9620. he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going	home	1637.469129882053
9621. but even before he started across the oiled road to his plymouth	parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station	he knew that he wasn't going home	3333.01430248855
9622. it	was nine o'clock in the morning: the hour which like a spade turning	clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that	had lain dormant in the quiet night	5495.4558985725325
9623. mission street at this hour was	populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his	tour of duty- the neighborhood that had known urbano quintana by	day	3329.485631617978
9624. sol phillips had purchased the alliance furniture	mart seventeen years ago	757.115515393612
9625. it was professedly worth three thousand dollars	in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high	letters across each of the two display windows	3097.3493073727254
9626. on the right	window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez	prop and under that se habla espanol	3469.5791198026063
9627. mr phillips	took a razor to gonzalez prop but left the promise	that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish	clientele would be welcome	2979.5155211082792
9628. language was no problem anyway;	mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from	the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission	street	4857.859023328945
9629. aside from the fact that business was slow this	time	of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising mr	phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun matson	who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a jiffy-couch-a-bed	mauve velour $79	4941.735724468787
9630. 89 nothing-down special!   she's honest	as the day mr phillips said and added mr gunnar	i can say this to you: beebe is a little too honest	4308.291526990348
9631. you can't	tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments	before he even signs for a loan on the money down! a time plan	is a mere convenience you understand and when- he interrupted	himself smiling	4391.316668214091
9632. i put her in lamps	22.20085406521466
9633. that way i don't lose	so much	93.90943125394026
9634. why don't you just hire somebody else	140.2625432962455
9635. she says she has to finish a story	166.7648587747542
9636. i	asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow but it seems the muse is	working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go	3896.789430579984
9637. casey	made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man	946.7434886191866
9638. his	name was george needham and he too had come from a good family	1423.7259280711398
9639. he was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that	had a pronounced wave	1261.5481446970002
9640. he was always well groomed and well tailored	and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came	from two good prep schools and a proper university	4845.288823363537
9641. an only child he	had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money	and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke	3224.427313627227
9642. since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main	interest was gambling	2117.31641948413
9643. all this went through casey's mind	in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that	these two should be together at all	2720.3540444056543
9644. for he had understood that betty	had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins	1651.4844170993852
9645. she had grown up with	young jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of	getting married at least twice	2456.740413524405
9646. he wanted to ask her about jenkins	now but he knew he couldn't do so in needham's presence	2364.7167924058567
9647. and so	still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and	spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding	2728.9370246549906
9648. where did you pick him up	65.1694696464931
9649. oh i've known him quite	a while	94.05104996749273
9650. she glanced at her companion fondly	65.14192905014625
9651. haven't i	george	0.20041515
9652. i've been after her for years needham	said but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last	few days	3030.809379833035
9653. the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached	out and touched casey's hand	930.4588646439112
9654. can i tell you a secret	65.77733712436755
9655. we're going to get married	14.710086585839907
9656. do you approve	0.30041514999999996
9657. casey kept	his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him	as	he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than	the girl	3239.335646952582
9658. he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling	and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from	betty's estate to subsidize him	4675.457604941879
9659. none of this showed in his face	and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand	1251.0399577195171
9660. he made a point of frowning	of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor	1631.0629517599157
9661. i'll	have to give it some thought he said	261.14926387292724
9662. you wouldn't want	me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would	you	1889.298597735878
9663. she made a face at him and then she laughed	375.5558533353571
9664. i'll get my references in order needham	said and though he spoke with a smile casey somehow got the idea	that he was not particularly amused	4098.258070337227
9665. stop by any time casey	14.77222660299611
9666. he stood up and touched the girl's arm	251.1241497736652
9667. if	you're really serious about working on that story i'd better take	you home	936.0193946029846
9668. casey watched them go still frowning absently	and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check	2356.7932156204515
9669. as he went	out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat	and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-piece piece in the slot	he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry	4367.385127894081
9670. a taxi	took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few	minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment	5207.921077910555
9671. because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple	of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's	car was still there	2985.825980403222
9672. in fact he did not think about jerry burton at	all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him	3474.348538754572
9673. only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was	empty did he remember his earlier problem	2040.491005455154
9674. even from where he	stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over	burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it	4488.461534574174
9675. then he was striding	across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly	inside him as he snatched up the note	2325.4902705604595
9676. jack:	look in	the wastebasket	22.46348146773841
9677. i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum	but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it	2454.4432013859923
9678. j	the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant	casey picked it up he knew what had happened	3481.4769107700668
9679. the discarded papers	inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and	the smell of whisky was strong and distinct	2441.8483445641823
9680. he put the basket down	distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself	and his plan that had seemed so foolproof	3052.360207904547
9681. for he remembered too well	how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned	to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself	2846.7715499712835
9682. for another	second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself;	then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more	serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him	6056.6419748124135
9683. it	no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him	263.3308040120616
9684. the important thing	was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun	in his pocket	2587.485414165109
9685. and that gun was empty	14.857888648405716
9686. even before his mind	had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket	and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver	4673.610152592515
9687. he considered	them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with	the problem and tried to find some solution	2037.3841278583634
9688. he said: the crazy	fool half aloud	140.69567117557716
9689. he put the shells on the table as though he	could no longer bear to hold them	1420.9770019701214
9690. he thought: where the hell	could he have gone	393.26636078385604
9691. how can i find him	14.828799650545026
9692. there was no answer	to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his	imagination out of control	3248.152630286576
9693. he tried to tell himself that maybe burton	had sobered up enough to get some sense	1254.3611896848183
9694. maybe he only intended to	scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun	would be good enough	3036.5523695356746
9695. he thought of other possibilities none of them	satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was	some way he could reach burton	2731.4509179264946
9696. then as he turned toward the telephone	it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached	for it eagerly	3476.21177907217
9697. tony calenda	0.20041515
9698. casey heard	the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to	make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his	head	4638.473993669534
9699. when he heard calenda say: what about that picture you took	this afternoon	786.9778042261512
9700. it still took him another few seconds to remember	the job he had done for frank ackerly	2122.79002605701
9701. you took a picture of me at the corner of	washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon	1560.0269148796965
9702. who says so	0.30041514999999996
9703. one of my boys	2.9690566583023883
9704. calenda was not the sort who walked around without one	of his boys close at hand	1882.396553611982
9705. so	0.20041515
9706. with	my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that	picture published	1881.6820050880117
9707. who says it's going to be published	93.32431308497246
9708. i wouldn't even want it to get around	247.68953485535195
9709. under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told	him what to do with pictures he had taken	1879.8799074996866
9710. even so he generally listened	and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections	properly	1877.80473435557
9711. right now however he was still too worried about jerry	burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told	him to care too much about tony calenda	3454.5469438249447
9712. his nerves were getting	a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice	1886.5505083808998
9713. i was hired to take a picture	93.52905398247484
9714. that's all i know about it and that's all i care	756.6734352283697
9715. maybe	you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said	636.3074111823656
9716. all right calenda said his voice	still quiet	248.51266586584038
9717. but i meant what i said casey	93.36545208105967
9718. if that picture	gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it i'm	going to send a couple of my boys around to see you	4652.14757238146
9719. you	do that casey said	14.780931086911059
9720. just be sure to send your two best boys	tony	560.3423250176402
9721. he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running	off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation	he had helped to create	3101.4029897462747
9722. as soon as he could think logically	again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burton's	home number	2816.2701961322596
9723. he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before	he hung up	934.4217541499589
9724. he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton	up that afternoon	1415.6649881421101
9725. when he was told that no one had seen burton since	then he thought of three other places that were possibilities	2021.4176287504238
9726. each	time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up	1409.5957438592404
9727. by	the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down	643.0653846896588
9728. he had done	all he could and that was that	558.2232975733094
9729. and anyway burton was not the kind	of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk	2161.6193483977163
9730. he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from	the fact that he felt responsible	2819.6765668797257
9731. he should have stayed here and	watched burton	167.64630489459904
9732. so he made a mistake	22.271131922041157
9733. so what	0.20041515
9734. he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make	a drink	1880.0686877305027
9735. only then did he decide he didn't want one	260.425528677346
9736. he considered	opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too	953.579133664334
9737. finally he went into	the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes	946.8003156618781
9738. he had just finished	unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again	1184.5252796110715
9739. when he snatched	it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent	1101.0075912462046
9740. casey	0.30041514999999996
9741. you don't know me but i know you	167.28992830202407
9742. if you want a picture	get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can	2611.4998165540264
9743. if you	hurry you might beat the headquarters boys	262.83117315058774
9744. casey heard the	click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it	took him no more than three seconds to make his decision	4280.885743032106
9745. for over	the years he had received many such calls	375.83851260431584
9746. some of them came from people	who identified themselves	394.06755896225803
9747. some telephoned because he had done	them a favor in the past	647.8230838311479
9748. others because they expected some sort of	reward for the information	754.4488160229466
9749. a few passed along a tip for the simple	reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break	2037.8617173686732
9750. only	an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey	had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not	hesitate this time	5172.763116532422
9751. he was in his car with his camera and equipment	bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more	to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue	3461.243060138963
9752. it was a district	of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and	he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed	on the brakes	5038.683097659299
9753. he did not bother with his radio- there would be time	for that later- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the	filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how	he had been summoned	4223.488492169745
9754. the police car had pulled up behind a	small sedan its headlights still on	1408.4683893787396
9755. slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving	at	little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one	station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart	4213.501164678169
9756. we're out just a little too far	140.6986846469208
9757. make a 90 degree straight	for shore	94.45940880775586
9758. poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively	as he saw elaine	749.6682692568718
9759. pretty quick	she replied	2.953587656968195
9760. will you drop the anchor	22.23883962643519
9761. poet nodded	swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where	he picked up the anchor	1732.8028982857275
9762. the rock and roll music coming from the radio	station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the rdf	3291.7143862807125
9763. reverse elaine said then peered through the loop	of the rdf and waved to poet	1102.0523931719124
9764. a second later she came behind	the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean	floor	3254.2244218076894
9765. she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on	the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the	cockpit faced toward the shore	3350.101628888305
9766. nick watched her somewhat enviously as	she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor	1878.8543601828637
9767. poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks	262.57447622780916
9768. the price	tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom	and looked at it curiously	3282.4664682204107
9769. nick wondered if elaine had bought them	but he said nothing	501.95592671534706
9770. nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything	140.31844400488004
9771. it seemed as if they were all under a spell	372.90530379148197
9772. there should be an	excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure	lost for more than four hundred years	3040.2666442802847
9773. but instead of chatter	there was a null like on the radio direction finder	946.3269069637565
9774. once in new	york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane	with a single engine	2831.9476607504926
9775. they had all been laughing joking when	suddenly the engine had failed	637.4700038605191
9776. no one had prayed	4.455257470253225
9777. all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle	over the wings	1114.4237409645698
9778. the pilot had been good	22.14375979232232
9779. he'd landed the plane	on a small airstrip in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had	coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment	3238.3220105066175
9780. there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent;	a tension similar to the one now	2360.5058048375327
9781. but in the plane there was a concrete	reason for it	495.24289850605345
9782. now at this moment there should be none h unless	skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe	3462.310417283952
9783. the same taut-nerved relationship as there	had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three	of them here on the boat	2600.274637402343
9784. it hung over them like a cloud its arrival	as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun	2377.379721652891
9785. silently elaine	picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet	behind her nick trailing behind him	2170.780871090018
9786. she threw back a cushion over	one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then	presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear	gun in her hand	5501.960096197105
9787. poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun	264.40642535217114
9788. they are the	best	4.4597350658610235
9789. she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion	373.0532108392624
9790. they are the most efficient	22.379339537738634
9791. and the deadliest poet	commented as he buckled on his tank harness	646.2062289654037
9792. why do you	need an arsenal	65.42497548792115
9793. nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon	94.03187419276273
9794. it's quite possible there's more than codfish down	there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held	the harness for elaine	3694.3903190984065
9795. a moment later moving awkwardly because	of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet	then rolled off the transom of the boat back first	3247.952962653283
9796. poet nodded	to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion	960.1548960382686
9797. another moment	and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as	a clue to their whereabouts	2019.1139759121536
9798. for a while nick followed the	twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine	2116.113183208701
9799. they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents	traveling side by side	939.3292246825888
9800. eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle	of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back	2591.9672002460466
9801. clasping	his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky	643.1295417452943
9802. there was	nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean	1193.8729493346307
9803. alfredo certainly	must have enjoyed being alone	94.02025680424536
9804. next to the ocean probably the	loneliest spot was the desert	753.74248348727
9805. if elaine's uncle had stuck to this	desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive	1254.3796615369342
9806. yet alfredo	wanted money h wanted money to roam through the deserts	964.8214882602961
9807. and	graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las	vegas	940.8507097604986
9808. it was an odd combination h a strange pair to stumble upon	the wreck of the trinidad	2128.874241728793
9809. but graham hadn't stumbled on it	43.456631918915534
9810. two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham	had been snooping around the san luis rey mission	3047.259359942058
9811. the small	helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised	up to watch it heading south	1718.4298193424183
9812. that was a hell of a note he thought	392.92388561160806
9813. a couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach	to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them	2027.2521863881052
9814. if the character	flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday	he would have had an eyeful	2605.359002957622
9815. off to the west a beautiful schooner	slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward san	clemente	2033.094754346653
9816. behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small	ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft	2366.1972655715144
9817. the fisherman was right	in the middle of the deep	374.75795673421356
9818. nick recalled stories that the two best	fishing spots in southern california were over the la jolla deep	and the redondo deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic	depths almost from the shoreline	5782.40069611867
9819. someday geologists	had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the	ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach	2622.852392237714
9820. meanwhile fishermen	took advantage of them to pull up whoppers	557.1191068443021
9821. sometimes the fish exploded	as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure	1099.966906121013
9822. why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip	756.4485358707373
9823. he couldn't skindive he couldn't run a boat except on the open	sea	794.4119446976107
9824. he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could	see none	1185.9192853048887
9825. strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the	coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went	up to the chartroom	3105.8041750091666
9826. turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit	stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music	2825.4398083150086
9827. elaine	and poet returned together popping up over the transom almost	like dolphins breaking water	1097.66774235575
9828. he sat up and watched as they pulled	themselves over the stern	967.4083181052067
9829. poet	shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead	638.3605358728927
9830. we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said	560.8824608732066
9831. pulling	off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern	then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water	2865.4747694866896
9832. which	is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile	she added as she swung her legs over the transom	3910.2962834737395
9833. any news	0.20041515
9834. not a thing	0.30041514999999996
9835. he tossed her a towel then repeated the	service for poet	504.6687514412435
9836. cigarette	0.30041514999999996
9837. elaine shook her head	as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded	938.463008287011
9838. his feet still hung	over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he	raised them to swing them in	3693.6426921294296
9839. the fin on his foot caught on the moulding	throwing him off balance	792.2438109243852
9840. his forearm smashed painfully into the	narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with	his other hand and rolled into the boat	4109.195770476468
9841. kee-reist! the	word hissed distinctly from poet's lips as he struggled to his feet	943.8130194918942
9842. turning slowly he saw poet	in a brilliant glare of horror	756.5540430171786
9843. poet! his face was still creased in	pain as he studied the underside of his arm	1250.1728323887532
9844. poet a murderer	0.30041514999999996
9845. turning	quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked	surprise	783.893966386364
9846. the sudden silence was too silent	65.38130755029121
9847. instinctively	aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking	first at elaine	1099.7606426957714
9848. she had caught the implication of the oath	250.51330876579726
9849. her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely	motionless	942.6140959495942
9850. and then nick knew that all of them knew h elaine	himself h and poet	1638.7256948771192
9851. elaine recovered first so quickly	that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction	1088.12325231378
9852. do	you need a bandage	22.31663710683542
9853. she asked steadily	0.20041515
9854. it's like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered	on nick's face then moved back to elaine	2355.666329353376
9855. hurts like hell for	a second then it disappears	259.15945883251555
9856. elaine turned and started toward the companionway	141.52767888182314
9857. but her walk	was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear	502.37356836620563
9858. so did poet	0.30041514999999996
9859. springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the	spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin	1735.7776078235158
9860. at the same	instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man	1642.0214132584617
9861. the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke	of an old steam engine	1886.8571489627375
9862. at the same instant elaine screamed wildly	the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the	water on top of the frantic struggling poet	4500.721394308715
9863. the moment the	sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would	survive in this alien element only if he did not panic	2727.3297031533807
9864. but the murderer	to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage	756.9526879367328
9865. the wide flippers	on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them	down into the water as they rolled over and over	2734.947946432602
9866. poet was the captured	arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying	to escape	1877.428952750711
9867. poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the	apparatus which would keep him alive under water	1579.5556445662592
9868. but nick would	not let go	65.44037518151305
9869. the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's	forehead bounced painlessly off nick's chin then disappeared	1414.8430050729653
9870. poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping	off the skin	1655.4442120739502
9871. for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's	slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop	him holding him now from the rear	2742.6054691839295
9872. something flailed at the side of	nick's head as they rolled around and around	1414.1425888307815
9873. suddenly poet	stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water	not rising not sinking	1568.6718388206366
9874. a sharp pain lanced across nick's chest and	a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of	others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising	into the sky	5486.606228134118
9875. a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of	him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head	1416.1387172872533
9876. the air hose was free!	the discovery struck nick like a blow	967.3666075370065
9877. desperately nick	flashed one hand up catching poet's neck in the bend of his elbow	1096.5719367876889
9878. at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his	other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece	3262.553171244386
9879. instinctively	he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose	942.569925815922
9880. at	once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with	a sudden wild exultation	2336.7690120378184
9881. as if this was a signal poet abruptly	began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them	sink through the water	2467.3920426374248
9882. relentlessly nick held on sucking on the	hose inhaling the air that belonged to poet	1647.870745002278
9883. poet was not fighting	nick now	43.57939544582106
9884. harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck	of a steamer clam	1650.1041426231864
9885. it's a rich village but not much for action- too	many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs	1726.3458946084957
9886. it's	at the far end of the county and the last time i came here was for	a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago	4099.393035204057
9887. chief bob	moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard	in his middle-age	1253.592177365108
9888. seeing me he said with real surprise well well	ain't we honored! hardly expected the head of county homicide	up for this murder	3478.3648424674857
9889. you sure climbed fast jed	14.740065212010233

9892. proves a college	education pays off	65.64377246800817
9893. his sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his	thick mouth and bad teeth	1100.166340810581
9894. i guess it helps i said	paying no attention to his ribbing	954.829252737368
9895. never could figure out	why you ever wanted to be a cop jed	782.634407059611
9896. you're not only young but h	well you don't even look like a police officer	1672.2096187401962
9897. a runt with	narrow shoulders and that brush haircut h hell you'd pass for a	juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set	2031.1404896269437
9898. in my day the first requirement	for a cop was to look like the law big and tough	2372.0822539280707
9899. man when my 275	pounds and six-four comes along why it's the same as another badge	1260.367715527295
9900. when i say move a guy moves!   don't worry about	my being tough moore	1413.1751057643003

9957. five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical	two-story house and when the jaguar stopped i managed to swallow	2319.748882442036
9958. there was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing	between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes	3675.4217092690296
9959. everything	shouted gentleman farming the kind of grandfather-father-to son folding	money the point is known for	1252.6999098537715
9960. the fins of a caddy were sticking	out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture	of old and expensive contemporary furniture	4264.102027621675
9961. nellie harris	wasn't old she was ancient- a tiny shriveled woman with a face	like a tan prune	1590.5598187289934
9962. she was also stone deaf in her right ear	388.0810052887122

10049. besides the number	of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper	637.6782603433193
10050. to the hotel people	you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that	particular suite	2338.468372926011
10051. still they may not want to rent it	165.14973064401423
10052. once inside keep your eyes open!	for what! alec was growing more and more skeptical	1651.5773084514974
10053. the police will have gone over every square inch of the place	with a fine-tooth comb	1258.5817167824812
10054. the hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed	it	393.0530134865323
10055. ten to one it's even been redecorated!   there's	always a chance they may have overlooked something returned	the chief	1716.0547177220265

10060. try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself- between	eleven pm and one am the night you arrive	2602.226959290524
10061. cheerful way to spend an evening! a sudden thought	wiped the smirk from his face	1103.8079834566347
10062. suppose the murderer should return	to the scene of the crime!   the chief's eyes gleamed	1652.0981944204837
10063. that is exactly what i'm hoping for	93.44956672005125
10064. after all	the murderer is still at large	248.4405193779641
10065. and the key to the suite is still	missing	260.95169898158827
10066. on the train alec refreshed his memory of the beauclerk	case by reading teletype flimsies- spot-news stories about	the crime sent out by the pearson city star a member of the syndicate	press	5331.982709249196
10067. diana beauclerk was a second-rate actress living	in new york	375.87731557679973

10073. at the time of her divorce forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum	in lieu of further alimony if she remarried	2315.399104652467
10074. according to stacy	she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask forbes	for the lump sum	3261.6837627671152
10075. stacy replied that it would bankrupt forbes	who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture	1735.50272991709
10076. stacy	said he left her suite at nine forty-five pm	555.9393878604784

10083. her door was locked and the key was missing	262.51411194201336
10084. when alec finished reading he was sure that either forbes or stacy	had killed diana beauclerk	1885.2604186770536
10085. forbes had motive and stacy had	opportunity	94.08134191910838
10086. find a motive for stacy or an opportunity for forbes and the case	would be solved	1890.3151834452353
10087. the hotel westmore proved to be one of the	older hotels in pearson city and definitely second-rate	1413.5522397787795
10088. alec's	first impression of the lobby was gloomy victorian dignity- black	walnut and red plush a black and white tiled floor and persian rugs	3703.778370838298

10096. opposite the number 1105 stood one word: unoccupied	251.53943194792032
10097. the clerk's glance followed alec's	14.738341073079905
10098. we have	better rooms vacant now he babbled	252.2197139285804
10099. at the same rate	2.9444541437473513
10100. alec's face was dark blunt and sulky	140.70434022529724
10101. he always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous	262.71835426245036

10104. there was a sudden stillness in the	lobby	249.0929829569427
10105. two women who had been chattering like parrots were struck	dumb	507.3149716154603
10106. a man lighting a match for his cigar paused until the flame	burned his fingers	1649.0625274450365
10107. even the bellboys on their bench were listening	166.8085697745962
10108. of course not!	anybody with a contagious disease been in there	754.1457544100588

10110. it's just that- well	1105 is being redecorated	250.59134787270924
10111. alec	leaned on the desk holding the clerk's eyes with his	504.53374783419895
10112. suppose	you tell me the real reason he drawled	392.21341069778873

10118. there	is no story he piped tremulously	140.92512055992202
10119. front! show this gentleman	to 1105!   the stillness persisted as alec followed	a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator	1891.2806413362564
10120. he could feel eyes on his	back	141.41251537366517
10121. he wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of	his suite quite so publicly	1416.5037342965563
10122. the corridor on the eleventh floor	was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet	2119.14694556885
10123. a	thick crimson carpet muffled every footfall	94.33526647415214
10124. at the end of the corridor	alec noticed a door marked: fire stairs	1183.6342830616452
10125. it was a neat	setup for murder	94.55328158480498
10126. the bellboy unlocked a white door numbered	1105	250.22538599036415
10127. the room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the	window	944.7520269289582
10128. a few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow	languid as falling feathers	1413.3780668704603
10129. hastily the boy switched on a ceiling	light	168.6491385210577
10130. the room looked normal and even commonplace	143.01582310786839
10131. there was	no hint of a violent struggle now	261.7076595928767
10132. deal furniture with a mahogany finish	was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department	store	2824.957925730784
10133. the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new	167.16288340129768
10134. it had never been	stained with blood	140.34239554167365
10135. table covers and towels were clean ashtrays	empty and supplied with fresh matches	795.289478450635
10136. the mirror over the bureau was	a blank eye round and innocent	960.0634721541658
10137. alec played the part of an innocent	tourist	165.71000907423831
10138. is there anything wrong with this room	141.4118782281863
10139. n-no	0.20041515
10140. the boy dropped his eyes	22.286473788045306
10141. afraid you'll	lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut	641.9457592617091
10142. the boy	raised his eyes	22.286473788045306
10143. if you want my advice pack up	and take the next train back to new york	1250.4297930449877
10144. were you on	duty here two weeks ago	250.70306602214472
10145. the boy hesitated	0.20041515
10146. but i wouldn't spend a night in here for a million	bucks!   he was in a hurry to get out of the room	3483.980088331305
10147. alec	gave him a tip and let him go	265.2742433089052
10148. alone alec examined the doors	22.470926331689057
10149. there were three- one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and	one to the room next door which was immovable- locked or bolted on	the other side	3123.4127782724363
10150. alec locked the hall door and put the key with his	watch on the bedside table	1893.7914547694695
10151. it was just quarter of nine	43.03327645955705
10152. as	he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust	on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover	4106.659654544892
10153. not gray like	the dust that collects in an unused room but white	792.4794319894156
10154. women didn't	use white face powder nowadays he recalled	391.3345210483004
10155. they used pink tan or	cream powder	94.35992627900893
10156. alec glanced into the bathroom	22.451485179385756
10157. blood in the	bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands	787.469571836421
10158. it seemed	clean now but alec decided against a bath	563.6810515090731
10159. he crawled into bed and	switched off the light	264.0547406329191
10160. in the darkness he could see the rosy	reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window	2596.813380014782
10161. it winked	as steadily as a metronome- on off- on off	506.41721240351126
10162. in less than	five minutes	alec was asleep	250.32286655242115
10163. he never knew just what woke him	94.32922483388575
10164. yet	suddenly he was wide-awake	22.172538443015696
10165. there was no sound and apparently no movement	in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on	the wall	2194.7813628936733
10166. he lay still listening to the silence watching the	light	566.112755644067
10167. somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes-	midnight	642.4678563281726
10168. according to the medical examiner she was shot between	eleven pm and one am h	1649.4904289357976
10169. alec heard a faint sound	14.951559930324908
10170. his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest	1174.5743995572598
10171. for the sound was inside the room	94.10657748565497
10172. he let his eyelids droop	and breathed heavily feigning sleep	561.0164034508969
10173. the sound was coming nearer	14.811798849623093
10174. a	monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable	750.6098328044761
10175. when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared	262.1744116461401
10176. when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there	748.9728161403013
10177. it stretched	to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling	647.1929401580362
10178. that	meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall	was moving closer to the source of the light- in this case the window	4297.823626190075
10179. cautiously alec tensed his muscles ready to jump	166.62797191419378
10180. the bedsprings	betrayed him with a creak	141.8127125661194
10181. someone	had moved beyond the range of the light from the window	645.7629322437517
10182. abandoning	caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch	1186.6653871149742
10183. before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs	944.681741393636
10184. he lashed out blindly with his right	140.15128118338836
10185. there was a thick squashy crack	of fist on flesh	372.7774695996804
10186. something hard grazed his knuckles	22.106064598821494
10187. he	put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought	to be	1426.4232260338767
10188. rough cloth rasped his fist	22.11311411208061
10189. there was a grunt curiously	inarticulate like that of an animal in pain	785.3866158866333
10190. something heavy shook	the floor as it dropped	251.5603826935002
10191. alec waited a moment on guard	43.37161337068753
10192. again he groped for the light switch	141.9091600703398
10193. the blue	rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room	1105.8056600625641
10194. on the	bare floorboards a man lay face down	393.92049336694083
10195. he had a short heavy powerful	body	93.65860021798215
10196. alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face	with narrow slanting eyes- a primitive tartar face from russia	or the balkans	3503.0139141135633
10197. the man's shoes were too pointed his overcoat too	broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist	1726.1798303518851
10198. there was	a slight bulge under the left armpit- a shoulder holster	967.6861339196732
10199. alec promptly	removed the gun	14.94744290867445
10200. he was familiar with this type	65.25334247600259
10201. he had seen it	in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night	clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts	2732.9331481408326
10202. but	he was surprised to meet it here	249.3521734324664
10203. diana beauclerk had no connection	with the underworld	167.39111467639083
10204. a professional gunman would not have killed	her with a weapon of such small caliber as a 	1295.6710288199522
10205. nor would he	choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be	so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country	road	3563.842365010752
10206. he opened his eyes	4.448545784997821
10207. what are you doing here	14.931884390163741
10208. demanded alec	0.30041514999999996
10209. the man	made no reply	14.930400123394026
10210. his lips were bruised and swollen	where alec had hit him	758.4223398785218
10211. did you kill diana beauclerk	14.966304064345405
10212. alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response	at all	952.8452238168644
10213. oh come on snap out of it! or i'll turn	you over to the police! the silence was getting on alec's	nerves	2177.5241729714257
10214. the man opened his mouth but no words came	393.4919119334688
10215. only that	curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight	501.4018250614655
10216. don't you speak english	4.4228972942193625
10217. the man opened his mouth	wider	43.35899249951996
10218. a forefinger pointed toward his gullet	64.99961062969001
10219. alec leaned forward to	look	14.830175874231177
10220. there were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was	mutilated	965.3394884036481
10221. in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver	and handley walker to murder and sudden death	2028.6074743795198
10222. but you realize	i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive	me if i tell you first of the old ones	4472.935575356298
10223. it was in 1814 that	abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house	on dogtown common a desolate place even then	2723.9073521914884
10224. he was sharpening his	razor	22.163554846097263
10225. sister said he do you think people who commit suicide	go to heaven	794.547158079116
10226. and she answered i don't know but i hope	you'll never do such a thing	1652.6754677673005
10227. without a tremor god forbid!	he said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny	day's swamp	2025.7120837248754
10228. what has this to do with the present	250.82632656307592
10229. much	i assure you	2.977635447596268
10230. you must know what gets into people even such as	red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them	3261.841595040426
10231. they	had learned both of them about abraham wharf	259.8882436937142
10232. that's why i	beg	you not to forget him	392.724439687661
10233. his ghost is not laid	14.765222822261265
10234. red and handley god	help them knew the old dogtown lore; and i knew they knew it for	i'd told them a lot of it	3861.246779741109
10235. and isn't it true that you get a deeper	perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is	he knows	2472.9508741049167
10236. yes gentlemen i am getting to the point to my	point	746.0367099347033
10237. you know the facts; they are set forth in your own newspapers	640.9927538197026
10238. you want from me the story but a story is about 'why' and then	perhaps about 'how'	2114.0106882807663
10239. the 'when' you know; yesterday morning	43.81177141625837
10240. so what i am trying to tell you is the 'why'- that is my	point- and that concerns the spirit of the matter	3475.4720702462123
10241. there is an	inwardness and a luster to old furniture	which has a provocative emanation if i may say so	1894.5345777817558
10242. places	too have their haunting qualities	65.1028098002657
10243. and my point	in this sad story is the spirit of the matter	789.6182799827518
10244. when you hold the spirit	of a thing then somehow you know the truth- you know a fake antique	from the real thing	3525.2631794539748
10245. and the truth is what you've come for is	it not	500.9856005707349
10246. now dogtown is one of those places that creeps into	the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer	3044.247518829474
10247. in fact	all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like	others	1728.0487059454929
10248. there's a different hall-mark on them	64.89276250946939
10249. there were no witch	burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family	944.3213291723436
10250. just think	of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger	and because he bungled the job and left	two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs	were made of glass	6331.983401930123
10251. after that he was never known to run or even walk	fast	642.3607317517633
10252. today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england	that i know of	1638.3327471113037
10253. there it sits a small highland with towns like	gloucester near by; but now it's the most lost and tortured place	in the world	2466.3515821212854
10254. those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity	took on some of the moraine's stony character	2112.5089489133998
10255. scientists say it	is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only	a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite	which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life	in them	4374.414515906228
10256. we'll walk up there later	21.98939729798746
10257. it's perhaps a mile from	here where we sit	264.0272319724798
10258. and not one single dwelling left there though	once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred	houses	3042.766404164644
10259. even i can	remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars and nobody has	lived there in the memory of any living man	2324.0451339724186
10260. it is now a sweep of boulders	and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common	and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows	4279.202482084827
10261. that's	your setting and a sinister one	94.5957903324468
10262. please get that in your reports	64.90080833564829
10263. it accounts for so many things	43.745775507371704
10264. both red mciver and handley walker	lived nearby almost as near as i do	1416.4181690589758
10265. red lived at lanesville	and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hour's	brisk walk; handley lived further on at pigeon cove	2990.8631683522117
10266. i'd often	find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching	963.225188286061
10267. they were	both	painters well	anyhow dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays	that only sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to	time	2971.7033654385523
10268. sea-road railroad lack of water killed dogtown	139.8228590125022
10269. dead dead	as a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i'm	about the last to be even interested	2330.6869304894826
10270. i knew red and handley	well	65.19084860208304
10271. as i said they were both painters	93.60333452247991
10272. they'd come separately	to gloucester some twenty years ago- there's always been an	artists' colony somewhere on cape ann- and each married here	3492.7789400883544
10273. they married cousins anta and freya norberg	93.66934977541561
10274. there are a lot of	scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted	furniture and take steam-baths	3035.0818994545757
10275. pretty girls among them with blonde	hair and pert faces	374.5362994680017
10276. handley married freya and red of the red beard	married anta	751.9988148448494
10277. and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that	i got to understand them all so well	1571.7466092103487
10278. the quarrel ended in a ridiculous	draw but i must tell you about it	1414.8277190473084
10279. oh yes i'm quite sure	it's important because of the beech pasture	638.4411349824852
10280. what's that	0.30041514999999996
10281. why that's what gave me the feeling gave me as-it-were the spirit	the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair	1880.6782469245495
10282. you see besides	being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar	755.1550625254949
10283. no i don't	hold with those who live entirely among dead things	639.2960650702564
10284. i know as	well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries	where the live wind blows and not from the hull	4488.411694522384
10285. but you've got	to know both	43.689094110444266
10286. what's below the water-line interests me also	140.5054974019337
10287. as i	was saying i've known all about the old records including the old	norberg deed	1263.6663085793714
10288. some ten years ago that page was torn out i don't	know by whom	1406.233006012011
10289. about five years ago handley came to ask me if he	could see the tattered register	1261.675898706629
10290. he was courteous and casual about it	as though it were of no consequence	1411.5000664564802
10291. he's always like that in spite	of being a big man	500.61444285823853
10292. of fingering i might almost say stroking a large mole with black hairs	a sensual man but very courteous some	would say slick	3489.6187143525326
10293. like his glossy black hair	14.850846583495771
10294. too many outside manners	to my taste	140.5536772959877
10295. he is the sort who with an appraising eye would	cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her	2734.7400146051937
10296. a real gentleman i feel would do neither	254.01427891364878
10297. he's always worn	a broad-brimmed hat and i've noticed in my small study at the society	that he rather smells of cosmetics	2186.339787110578
10298. the next week cousin red	wandered in as casually but curt and untidy	1193.7934677604803
10299. red was small and fine-boned	like ivory-inlay	94.55577382607797
10300. he too asked to see the same page	250.16735226281745
10301. when i	told him someone had torn it out he shouted	502.6188490234209
10302. by god it's that	damn handley the sneak! and later in the same week they both	came together to examine the register	3263.6871782901603
10303. fortunately we were alone in	the building- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own	past or in the lovely craft of other days- for they began to abuse	each other in the foulest language	3944.6798585995557
10304. red thrusting out his tawny beard	handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair	1412.3408456232432
10305. le rouge et le noir	14.909965661473018
10306. red always	was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the	two	1878.4462112546075
10307. but for my presence they would have been at each others' throats	642.3458729360138
10308. during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from	the accusations each hurled at the other	2124.3353826679822
10309. the beech pasture had	suddenly	become valuable	94.13665307779894
10310. there's a fine granite quarry there and granite's	coming back for public buildings	1184.1275364060548
10311. both men knew it was in the	norberg family holdings but to which of the cousins did it belong	anta or freya	2154.847910705871
10312. fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will	had said	561.8653866580652
10313. it began with a preamble of course	93.81429189543829
10314. this explained that the	judge of probate of essex county 1785 or 1786 appointed three free-holders	of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate	3904.2112831398044
10315. after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had	been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of	the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges	to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar	also one cow right and lastly	they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as	dower namely the beech pasture	0.20124717349522497
10316. and i remember that the whole of	the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty	pounds	2595.294748758366
10317. i wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring	coxcombs when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged	to their wives jointly	2862.340603203348
10318. that battle scene ridiculous at it was	remained in my mind	750.9303422148289
10319. a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further	heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day	i saw handley escorting anta red's wife up on dogtown common	3331.680044140099
10320. i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence	565.5124944780968
10321. not that	i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high	and i am a small woman	1889.3432306726038
10322. one other cause of jealousy between them	i must tell you	746.5492824299583
10323. paint! gloomy and unkempt as red mciver was	he was much the better painter	943.1348474174276
10324. i suppose handley knew it	22.034889218523592
10325. if red	had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in	rockport	1265.4461671606966
10326. you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen	remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence	2583.049919028772
10327. by	such touches the pattern takes shape	94.43073075480869
10328. you would call these the motives	of crime	252.39412428362022
10329. i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the	designs of destiny	937.8958553609924
10330. yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance	to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday	3046.361212430894
10331. one month ago on the 20th of october was the opening of the gunning	season in massachusetts	1418.6896201389322
10332. not much to shoot but there are a few	pheasant	560.6816541797941
10333. rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk	around here haven't the sense to appreciate	1729.6175703662072
10334. any more than they have	the sense to eat mussels	561.3558190061552
10335. that was the day red was said to have	gone away	498.98064068382445
10336. oh yes he'd talked about doing so	141.89985813928027
10337. in fact he often disappeared	from time to time- off to paint the sea aboard a dragger	out from gloucester	1881.2930528218499
10338. anta his wife never seemed to mind	140.96877001275305
10339. i suppose	these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin	handley	941.5535657311581
10340. anyhow i wasn't surprised early that morning to see	handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back	road	2826.7445849876635
10341. no he didn't have his gun which he should have	374.9306962978065
10342. it would	have been a good excuse for his being there at all	1175.6837955004441
10343. i myself had been	up there by seven o'clock after mushrooms since there'd been a	week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear	as sandwich glass	3557.0579405587205
10344. that's what the man had said	65.22330598958847
10345. haney peered doubtfully at his	drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes	498.75511235065204
10346. he had no ready	answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing	1655.767215698706
10347. was the	man drunk or crazy or both	169.94617174913247
10348. but his new-found buddy had matched him	drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still	clear	3043.8787519041634
10349. the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself	and looked away from those eyes	1261.7134405636293
10350. eyes that were clear but also bright	with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them	2580.8774277008697
10351. why hadn't he noticed it before	43.28298306003084
10352. no the man was not drunk h	he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger	2123.714439230015
10353. but of course	he remembered now	43.881760746980646
10354. it was blurred after two hours of steady drinking	but the occasion of it came back to him	2358.941577455625
10355. the stranger his head	seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the	light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection	2741.788783573027
10356. brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have	been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before	3669.7839698401012
10357. his shout	had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking	on the spur of the moment	1565.656494885473
10358. as a matter of fact he wouldn't	have cared at all if the guy had been hit	2120.067689770222
10359. actually he regretted having	opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver	jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them	3006.09715540331
10360. by then	the stranger was thanking haney profusely and had one arm around his	shoulders as if he were an old friend	3282.658940645605
10361. so the driver started to curse	at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his	safe-driving record	2457.4720075889077
10362. then the man he saved turned and looked	squarely into the truck driver's face without saying a word	2371.4904633156684
10363. very	suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and	went back to his truck	1572.2115563600025
10364. haney hadn't given it much thought at	the time	388.8221664549138
10365. now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck	driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off	2192.5332366454104
10366. it must have	been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word	2121.084272272059
10367. when the light went their way they went on across the street	639.4786452497967
10368. and	when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his	favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them	4627.139638940937
10369. phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner	and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges	2038.3411134103287
10370. but he decided	he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks even though	he made good money at his job	3052.6592775045588
10371. now	he wondered	if it was worth it having a screwball for company	787.8579908316058
10372. he really	didn't take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy	1183.8724952970147
10373. when	he finally got the coughing under control he realized that pete	was still waiting for an answer- he didn't	even seem to wink as he continued to stare	3110.403086947241
10374. haney managed	a weak laugh	22.220737867873403
10375. guess i can't think of anyone pete	93.33304684522732
10376. a faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows	249.94462827908688
10377. i think you aren't taking me seriously phil	166.22062088743377
10378. and	everybody has some kind of grudge	139.8820417321895
10379. i might have got hit by that truck	if it wasn't for you	789.4827454948055
10380. i believe in returning favors	22.25757398844005
10381. i'll do	anything for somebody i like	93.7207763996876
10382. it won't cost you a cent phil	141.05612040411603
10383. go	ahead and try me!   phil rubbed his forehead wearily	370.9023022686539
10384. he	was beginning to feel woolly	65.16498774208739
10385. maybe it would be better to humor the	guy and then make an exit	943.2177782489823
10386. he really didn't expect anything to come	of it and there were a few people h   all right	he	conceded finally if you must know i don't get along with the	landlord	5162.1660819717135
10387. he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio	and sing while i'm taking a bath	1730.2045628739802
10388. he says the neighbors complain	but i don't believe it	562.3454789017146
10389. why don't they tell me themselves if it	bothers them	371.2360451218348
10390. the man closed his eyes and nodded	141.32785848465272
10391. when he	looked up again he seeemd almost contented	260.7864074599234
10392. it will take a little time	65.19808209028592
10393. i want to study your landlord's	habits and movements first	375.3724832544356
10394. you see i always make it look like	an accident	563.9309358886743
10395. maybe suicide if it looks reasonable	43.691785620459
10396. in that way there's	no trouble for the customer	390.4797150674561
10397. customer	0.20041515
10398. pete smiled modestly	0.30041514999999996
10399. it's my	line of work he said h   five minutes later before haney	could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell	2460.955031882327
10400. haney	watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently	and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure	4256.861991987533
10401. phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed	it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for	the other glass on the table	3331.155799671101
10402. some time before midnight he returned	to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of	mind before he fell asleep	3678.5539310008776
10403. the next day sunday the hangover	reminded haney where he had been the night before	1107.2962873424717
10404. the hangover	in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he	groaned	1645.5043012604724
10405. he went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly	landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual	as if tenants were a burden in his life	3653.761852125287
10406. phil shrugged and ignored him	22.41107637047556
10407. he went back to work monday	43.433686562268136
10408. by wednesday the landlord was	still alive	140.10750097588496
10409. of course h on thursday haney mailed the monthly	check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger	could do something about her h   coming home from work	he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment	building	4714.652878457051
10410. inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly	392.0008122622876
10411. his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one	of his fellow tenants what had happened	1579.739654777231
10412. late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while	on some obscure errand or inspection	2374.027007356197
10413. he had apparently been alone	14.890688633030745
10414. nobody	witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed	on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance	3065.903169791435
10415. haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the	blood drain from his cheeks	1411.2951545606506
10416. he muttered something about how terrible	it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator	1887.2656628482214
10417. once	inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped	limply in a chair	1418.2205199590594
10418. after a while he began to feel better about	it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions	2592.7500214252586
10419. but after	all why should they	43.32418230194925
10420. still later he finally convinced himself	that it was an accident- just a coincidence	1414.5206892791998
10421. the stranger really	had nothing to do with it of course h   haney went to bed	happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord	2855.4297414554508
10422. after all the	man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off	for it	2357.813940238424
10423. really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor!	so you thought i didn't mean what i said	2184.070356755575
10424. the stranger's	eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings	1650.9522112387617
10425. it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was	beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare	1877.8297148754816
10426. however haney	knew it was not a dream	249.67471458797223
10427. he might be very tight but he knew where	he was	502.7406836795035
10428. it was the same bar and it was two weeks later- saturday	night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual	3470.5941663014273
10429. he	had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible	from any talkative friendly lushes	2037.4297070815635
10430. he was enjoying the weekly	ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened	with water	2361.928970771376
10431. this favorite grievance was not the landlord	93.83972226696517
10432. he had	already quite forgotten about him	141.979925574023
10433. in fact he had only mentioned him	on the spur of the moment	790.8750964923645
10434. his real grievance was lolly	22.072258273286455
10435. toward	the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making	wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became	aware that he was not alone	3453.0873789620746
10436. he looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld	the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him	as if they were fellow conspirators	4099.026941661487
10437. he hadn't even noticed-	what was his name	166.76547206987888
10438. pete	0.30041514999999996
10439. - he hadn't seen him sit down	20.35632244289402
10440. the man	was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow	1671.2405782450205
10441. haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped	in the corner with the wiry dark little man	2027.7411579164673
10442. he began to wish that	he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through	the crossing	2591.6993466586814
10443. was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep	for a bar-buddy	1103.2137416395808
10444. he'd have to start going to some of the other places	again	962.1418772821987
10445. in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked	phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off	his back	2739.4684163834927
10446. he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly	realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice	3687.916663780824
10447. pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody	167.40456310836746
10448. haney	didn't want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a	drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble	3027.92073219773
10449. but there was no trouble	14.828335196735742
10450. the guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by haney's lack of	appreciation	1176.0612748928602
10451. to break the uncomfortable silence haney began	to talk	261.9054345501649
10452. in time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly	about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he	noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert	face and the suddenly bright eyes	6705.208255674834
10453. when he paused to moisten	his throat the stranger broke in	502.6063552191493
10454. but why pay her bills	22.140743360237316
10455. if she	runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not	just divorce her	1891.2378203377375
10456. haney scowled	0.30041514999999996
10457. that bitch would love	a divorce he growled	169.16158139956914
10458. then she'd get half of everything i	have	248.28512594913803
10459. community property deal- you know	14.97854212998547
10460. i'd have to sell out	my business to pay her off with her share	1397.8995125401739
10461. she can drop dead!	pete nodded understandingly	94.28904433324603
10462. you must	understand i haven't been in this state too long	752.4125574795269
10463. i came out here	to retire	43.306549556505374
10464. that's why i- why i do a free job now and then	967.3224497165056
10465. you	should have told me about her before	165.35693283082415
10466. haney felt a twinge	of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again	1409.4980433137448
10467. then a wild	thought ran circles through his clouded brain	373.6313990866233
10468. suppose- just suppose	this guy was really what he said he was! a retired professional killer	h if he was just a nut no harm was done	4281.5452896980005
10469. but if he was the	real thing he could do something about lolly	794.6288595752078
10470. he felt very cunning	very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot	2134.432650208105
10471. no offense intended he said gently	43.5627004240428
10472. but it's just that-	well you know	140.9094054016685
10473. the cops didn't suspect a thing and i thought	it was a coincidence	790.119484111524
10474. after all i didn't know you pete	141.3307353722925
10475. it	could have been an accident	43.76474022767762
10476. but if	you say you managed it h the stranger was hooked	966.597550397619
10477. yes yes he muttered impatiently	14.854442583981713
10478. of course	it looked like an accident	142.40471107284966
10479. i always work it that way- and always	at a time when the customer has an alibi	1415.2543260911418
10480. let me prove it phil	22.051003863519387
10481. i	think i can manage one more favor for you	379.6600875344092
10482. haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass	558.9286587140653
10483. about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away	two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through	2316.6014954503125
10484. c'mon	he whispered; floor level's about three feet down so	don't fall	966.1379839289982
10485. i went through and down into pitch darkness	168.20549431438448
10486. he said	jist stay still	22.08799303705969
10487. i'll pull the boards back and then get us	a light	502.3780450142485
10488. jist stay where you are	22.417074187573863
10489. i jist stayed where i was while	he fumbled around and then walked away	943.5202095679537
10490. a moment later he struck a	match and lighted a candle and i could see	1666.3317534051941
10491. it was a big room	empty except for a few things of pop's at the far end- a wooden	crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled	bindle	3559.4885987857006
10492. i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him;	he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no	light would show through	4661.287487764658
10493. i took the pint bottle from my pocket	and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket	2194.336600124847
10494. he drank and handed it back	65.39275346639452
10495. nice	place i told him	14.791544627707506
10496. listen i got a buddy i travel with	real nice guy named larry	1185.915419698074
10497. i know where he is right near here	167.63223637563127
10498. could	he join the party and sleep here tonight too	564.6929102863927
10499. we'll both be blowing	town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you	940.649237722766
10500. he hesitated	a second looking at the bottle before he said sure-sure	and i reassured him	1885.0610494276557
10501. he'll bring a bottle too and i'll	get another one or maybe two while i'm out	1252.9946698876468
10502. you can work on this	one while i'm gone kill it if you want	1406.2963698580502
10503. i took a short swallow	from it myself and handed it to him	790.8378776877012
10504. his sure-sure was	enthusiastic this time	65.080463140105
10505. he put the bottle down	14.976793211515973
10506. git over by the window	while there's light an' i'll put th' candle out	1416.7372439357534
10507. when	yuh come back i'll put it out agin till you're both inside	786.4810886708649
10508. charlie was waiting leaning against a building front	251.5662005176868
10509. perfect	set-up i told him	14.791544627707506
10510. but we got to go back to fifth and get	another bottle or two	1418.3433644646573
10511. on the way i'll give you the scoop	168.40350577907017
10512. on the way i gave him the scoop	251.4183836462605
10513. i bought another pint of sherry	and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket	and then lighted the candle again	2984.9497609589844
10514. i introduced my friend larry	to pops and we made ourselves comfortable	957.070316390406
10515. there was still a little	not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and	killed it and charlie opened his	2586.970535421605
10516. i was reminded amusedly	by a poem of kenneth patchen's called the murder of two men	by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves which patchen himself	read on a record against jazz background	5498.876146051227
10517. the poem consisted of	only two words the word wait repeated over and over at irregular	intervals and with different inflections and then the word now!	and a blaring final chord from the jazz group	3790.284444873518
10518. this was	the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither	of us was wearing gloves	3474.68997448539
10519. but we could wait all right; there	was no hurry	374.1399821600627
10520. i said wait h wait to charlie and he grinned	digging the reference	1187.9733908092394
10521. we'd heard the record together once	43.40507699957542
10522. the second bottle passed a few times	139.5464186375602
10523. pop was taking long ones but	not showing the effect yet	499.7714628040676
10524. he seemed as drunk as when i'd first	talked to him but no drunker	1414.490821771485
10525. he had a capacity; if we'd really	been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more	wine	2336.4047868174107
10526. about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked	at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now	2799.640783871417
10527. i said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final	drink	790.451687631155
10528. when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely pops was	looking toward me and i said now to charlie and he swung	the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket	once	6186.533409688776
10529. it was a lead pipe cinch	43.80768756294421
10530. there was a sound like the one	you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder	and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise	4693.382338823037
10531. out cold	if not dead; and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never	known that anything had hit him	1877.3514678595504
10532. i reached my hand toward	him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie	said wait!- and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit	but as an order- so i stopped my hand and looked at him	6790.452006863621
10533. he was	holding the piece of lead pipe out to me	498.80524559525367
10534. we don't want to	know whether he's dead yet	392.05848542034363
10535. i gauged that blow to be borderline	93.72722339908776
10536. to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill	396.22196764976127
10537. you hit again about twice	that hard before we know whether he's dead or not	1097.6934711312542
10538. that way we'll	never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice	2118.1260774955354
10539. dig	0.20041515
10540. i dug him i saw his point; it made sense	561.2828728670163
10541. i took the piece of pipe from charlie's hand and used it harder	than he had	1261.4926766564372
10542. the thunk was louder anyway and i thought i heard	bone crack	965.2991190383354
10543. that did it if mine	didn't	43.64309209298115
10544. and we'll never know which	22.257582046672777
10545. all right now i'll give	you a hand	167.50850746921748
10546. we straightened pops up and i made sure there	was no trace of a heartbeat	1643.4368705384218
10547. let's	put him down again the way he was	261.6604932757697
10548. it's a more natural position	22.247884821195953
10549. how do you feel	2.969198969727793
10550. charlie asked me	0.30041514999999996
10551. what do you feel	2.969198969727793
10552. nothing	0.30041514999999996
10553. well h maybe i'm exaggerating	14.844063889754997
10554. it was a kick but not	a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for	stakes	3244.97110136213
10555. but let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of	here	634.054315982845
10556. now first question: the bottles	22.297985879041754
10557. shall we take them all with	us or leave one	373.40735607952786
10558. take them i said	4.41411768167019
10559. if we	left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints	503.9859182680073
10560. here's the picture	we want to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found	1642.3521878149174
10561. this	happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum	641.547129057459
10562. if they'd	been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him	1887.7713245357822
10563. and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so	we take that	788.2357077406743
10564. i've been careful	about fingerprints	22.447153949251316
10565. there are	the boards over the window of course but they're not painted and too	rough to take prints	1728.3422399457602
10566. same goes for the rough cement of the ledge	389.98950091654683
10567. besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting	379.1433378660805
10568. they find dead	winos every day maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of	death	2125.1273327224253
10569. we can't take a chance on that	93.50660353483605
10570. we've got to	assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the	picture consistent	2127.0835228260194
10571. our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have	turned out his pockets	789.389992141169
10572. we did that and found	a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change	1649.2256028015042
10573. we	took the matches- they were book matches and once they'd been touched	might retain fingerprints- and the change	1726.1284056723591
10574. we discussed	the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it	burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason	to blow it out	5163.628181305663
10575. the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't	set fire to the crate when it guttered out	2020.5620448789355
10576. a fire wouldn't have	mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner	1641.7256707153247
10577. he	might not be found for days even weeks otherwise	373.2235056378109
10578. we went once	more over every point then triple-checked	393.67089659697046
10579. being picked up for questioning	by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining	danger and we weren't picked up by a cop	2979.1825980219605
10580. in fact nobody saw	us cop or citizen	250.1860798776701
10581. winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was	completely deserted at that hour	1101.273953676085
10582. which if it matters was one am	140.5485695175958
10583. less than three hours ago we'd decided in maxine wells's	pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder	1578.8330560525787
10584. it had gone like clockwork	22.259812004758516
10585. almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told	myself that was ridiculous	943.4295534053108
10586. how safe is too safe	22.203568640386038
10587. thinking like that	can get you into a padded pad	378.0553932558948
10588. an hour later we were back	in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint	2569.711124148657
10589. we	decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow	375.5963056568248
10590. also our plans for	me to commit charlie's murder and for him to commit mine	1649.2995509165055
10591. but we	were really going to do it	166.6783738893297
10592. we shook hands on it	22.153535383094443
10593. we planned	ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes	1101.3609687704325
10594. i'd tell him everything i'd learned about seaton's habits	and habitat and he'd tell me the score on radic	2588.772592942974
10595. we made the date	for two o'clock in the afternoon at maxine wells's pad	938.3865796630982
10596. charlie	would get there early because he had the key	564.0647834796813
10597. from here on in the	less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one another's	rooms the better	2032.447641892792
10598. i was dead tired and slept soundly	as far as i know dreamlessly	1182.0859839856303
10599. we met at maxine's and decided	we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the	evening to talk things out	2731.265905443003
10600. charlie had brought food and we'd decided	on no drinks	563.4266675232814
10601. i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night	but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking	2175.098051384719
10602. i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and	his house and domestic arrangements	1889.6219703232805
10603. i drew diagrams and floor plans;	he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces	and flushed them down	2180.5294976814444
10604. he gave me equivalent and even more detailed	dope on radic including diagrams- one of the apartment building	radic lived in and one of the apartment itself	4288.60883378557
10605. he'd been there several	times back when while he and radic had been friends or at least	not enemies	1728.485951585868
10606. it didn't take us as long as we'd thought	it might; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie	said well i guess that's it	4464.794739957201
10607. shall we flip a coin to see	which of us goes first	641.0035279743836
10608. or would you rather deal a hand of show-down	poker or play a game of gin rummy or what	2587.717037385906
10609. wait a	minute charlie i said	43.306459458858875
10610. one thing we haven't discussed expense	money	140.96920809375263
10611. we'll need some at least if only bus fare to the	scene of the crime	1104.1866490263828
10612. and if you're as flat broke as i am i think	we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station	or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while	the other does his dirty work	6906.2678268771515
10613. all right i'll	come clean	14.884203594178393
10614. i've got a little stashed for a rainy day and i	guess this is rainy enough	1880.1087027035344
10615. if you draw the short	straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take	off to visit my sister in frisco	2457.9590093133343
10616. then after i'm back another	fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi	somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy	4667.299171957752
10617. i took a deep breath and the plunge	168.06202249631042
10618. in that case	let's not draw	64.998714613568
10619. i'll go to bat first	14.77278169752122
10620. you'd have to wait till seaton's	back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris	to have her have an alibi for d-night	4293.274671271935
10621. so it wouldn't be	for days or even a week before you could do anything	1109.738632689106
10622. but your friend	manny can go any time	249.91436733733568
10623. he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder	166.7283427590581
10624. i was hoping you'd say that willy	139.51382609884263
10625. but i wouldn't	have suggested it	43.04371191586131
10626. well- in that case i take off tomorrow morning	for frisco	747.1162263181561
10627. and in case i brought the money with me	261.5784195319998
10628. now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer	to his brothers merge without let	3025.951281969973
10629. self's integrity was and	is and ever had been	262.3093146074506
10630. mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves	the many threes-fulfilled on mars corporate and discorporate the precious	few on earth- the unknown powers of three on earth that would	be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he	grokked and cherished himself	7232.419289101711
10631. mike remained in trance; there	was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing-	all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster	tabernacle	h why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss	dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell	of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and	wailing-   jubal's conversations coming and going- jubal's	words troubled him most; he studied them compared them with what	he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages	the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in	0.20124717349522497
10632. the word church which turned up over and over again among jubal's	words gave him knotty difficulty; there was no martian concept	to match it- unless one took church and worship and	god and congregation and many other words and equated them	to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting	h then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which	had been rejected by jubal by mahmoud by digby	0.30166232349522504
10633. he was closer to understanding	it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of	the martian concept it stood for	2315.9354836274606
10634. in his mind he spoke simultaneously	the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking	2123.2724744346347
10635. repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the	lotus he sank into nirvana	1583.7209778183008
10636. before midnight he speeded his	heart resumed normal breathing ran down his check list uncurled and	sat up	2365.3762693262365
10637. he had been weary; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed	ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him	2330.4233073736923
10638. he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity	for quiet	1651.7086345614957
10639. he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter	a water brother	789.1275134767691
10640. my	you look chipper	4.422185736062751
10641. i feel fine! where is everybody	43.791537898468974
10642. asleep	0.30041514999999996
10643. ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people	started going to bed	943.7758371514277
10644. mike felt disappointed	that mahmoud had left; he wanted to explain his new grokking	1408.3016022056404
10645. i ought to be asleep too but i felt like a snack	644.1195433996552
10646. are you hungry	0.30041514999999996
10647. sure i'm hungry!   come on there's	some cold chicken and we'll see what else	939.5527587956564
10648. they went downstairs	loaded a tray lavishly	141.46351356658792
10649. it's	plenty warm	0.20041515
10650. a fine idea mike agreed	22.33704586610437
10651. warm	enough to swim- real indian summer	94.09986321061783
10652. i'll switch on the floods	22.41696249930297
10653. i'll carry the	tray	2.9699680933704307
10654. he could see in almost total darkness	139.73818534935293
10655. jubal said that his	night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown	up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to	it; his foster parents had taught him to see	4046.0062422060973
10656. as for the night being	warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but	his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and	pressure; he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of	it	6156.507539964845
10657. but he was looking forward to snow- seeing for himself that each	tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had	read- walking barefoot rolling in it	3431.795853059871
10658. in the meantime he was	pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of	his water brother	2814.129959450997
10659. i'll switch on	the underwater lights	43.84930199701019
10660. that'll be plenty to eat by	64.57992827824397
10661. mike liked having light up through the ripples; it was a goodness	beauty	789.5417779499066
10662. they picnicked by the pool then lay back on the grass	and looked at stars	1656.774302400338
10663. it is mars	isn't it	14.839116502654562
10664. or antares	0.30041514999999996
10665. it is mars	0.20041515
10666. mike	0.30041514999999996
10667. what are they doing on mars	43.85273642752208
10668. he hesitated;	the question was too wide for the sparse english language	956.182695834148
10669. on the	side toward the horizon- the southern hemisphere- it is spring;	plants are being taught to grow	1572.789810724972
10670. 'taught to grow'	0.30041514999999996
10671. he hesitated	0.20041515
10672. larry teaches plants to grow	22.187517549325015
10673. but my people- martians i mean; i now grok you	are my people- teach plants another way	1417.3222208986392
10674. in the other hemisphere	it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the	summer	are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing	4281.572576776718
10675. of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated	and the others are sad	1264.5095287230315
10676. yes i heard it in the news	140.63725959551883
10677. mike had not heard it; he had not known it until asked	636.5728031286062
10678. they should not be sad	22.182963679863008
10679. mr booker t w jones food technician	first class is not sad; the old ones have cherished him	1582.4889031799544
10680. he had his own face	dark and beautiful	251.46206171258595
10681. oh dear!	mike h do you ever get homesick	262.13718062864143
10682. for mars	0.30041514999999996
10683. at	first i was homesick he answered	93.58628840317984
10684. he	rolled toward her and took her in his arms	556.6473167608814
10685. but now i am not lonely	43.285214489853374
10686. i grok i shall never be lonely again	250.1203332503232
10687. mike darling-	they kissed and went on kissing	167.54301344680476
10688. presently his water	brother said breathlessly	64.52567830911939
10689. oh my! that was almost worse than	the first time	373.9897829607172
10690. you are all right my brother	64.88604644159895
10691. yes	0.20041515
10692. a long time later	by cosmic clock she said mike	559.7172493587583
10693. is that- i mean 'do	you know'-   i know	264.69399764877915
10694. it is for growing closer	22.14644463806436
10695. well h i've been ready a long time-	goodness we all have but h never mind dear; turn just a little	2026.2331233781479
10696. as they merged grokking together mike	said softly and triumphantly: thou art god	1178.4742701622213
10697. her answer	was not in words	43.48659514045941
10698. then as their grokking made them ever closer	and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called	him back: oh! h oh! thou art god!   we	grok god	4829.019268662245
10699. on mars humans were building pressure	domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship	1723.0810976109483
10700. this	went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful	560.6057494092183
10701. part of	the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance	plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more	friendly to future human generations	3657.2711329168424
10702. the old ones neither	helped nor hindered this plan; time was not yet	1176.570363976523
10703. their meditations	were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for	many millennia	1099.7097970998252
10704. on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet	published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation	marks and spaces; time magazine reviewed it and suggested that	the federation assembly daily record should be translated into	the medium	6336.553093995618
10705. a colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs	of plants and mrs joseph douglas	was quoted as saying: i would no more sit down without flowers	on my table than without serviettes	3549.737985060474
10706. a tibetan swami from palermo	sicily announced in beverly hills a newly discovered ancient	yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and	cosmic attraction between sexes	4500.600570404566
10707. his chelas were required to assume	the	matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud	from rig-veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another	room- nothing was stolen; the purpose was less immediate	3935.9036201214717
10708. the president of the united states proclaimed the first sunday	in november as national grandmothers' day and urged america	to say it with flowers	3695.6050663010014
10709. a funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting	166.35181500918637
10710. fosterite bishops after secret conclave announced the	church's second major miracle: supreme bishop digby had been	translated bodily to heaven and spot-promoted to archangel ranking	with-but-after archangel foster	4473.787667652648
10711. the glorious news had been held up	pending heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new supreme bishop	huey short- a candidate accepted by the boone faction after	lots had been cast repeatedly	3559.413397315401
10712. l'unita and hoy published	identical denunciations of short's elevation l'osservatore	romano and the christian science monitor ignored it	times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian	simply reported it- the fosterites in england were few but extremely	militant	6292.189587841913
10713. digby was not pleased with his promotion	93.58505784661739
10714. the	man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished- and	that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up	3479.250767758166
10715. foster listened	with angelic patience until digby ran down then said listen	junior you're an angel now- so forget it	1876.549053145053
10716. eternity is no time for	recriminations	64.78265587250758
10717. you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me	372.30382691887206
10718. afterwards you did well enough	22.062601758327347
10719. now that short is supreme bishop	he'll do all right he can't help it	944.1179393060638
10720. same as with the popes	22.265469020118744
10721. some of them were warts until they got promoted	258.3438601768647
10722. check with one of	them go ahead- there's no professional jealousy here	959.6221268041602
10723. digby calmed down but made one request	94.7856656337974
10724. you can't touch him	4.442869439192954
10725. you shouldn't have tried to	14.738821707878802
10726. oh you	can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of	yourself	2358.2869546789566
10727. but i'm telling you it'll be turned down- you don't	understand the system yet	949.5240743790212
10728. the martians have their own setup different	from ours and as long as they need him we can't touch him	2843.1574221107157
10729. they run their show their way- the universe has variety something	for everybody- a fact you field workers often miss	1888.6184213952406
10730. you	mean this punk can brush me aside and i've got to hold still for	it	1881.666789488731
10731. i held still for the same thing didn't i	261.51101333890585
10732. i'm helping you now am i not	140.18834499412696
10733. now look there's work to be	done and lots of it	500.6461288008095
10734. the boss wants performance not gripes	65.4938679060846
10735. if you	need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and	take it	1577.1492965970633
10736. otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig	in	561.6420534531273
10737. the sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic	643.9211488052806
10738. get happy junior!   digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh	392.8710298983152
10739. where do i start	2.9736492444159452
10740. jubal did	not hear of digby's disappearance when it was announced and when	he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it; if mike	had had a finger in it he had gotten away with it- and what happened	to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasn't	bothered	7889.328806402812
10741. his household had gone through an upset	93.5801751939347
10742. jubal deduced	what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't want	to inquire	1873.9469558668784
10743. mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself	in the clinches	938.416163454672
10744. anyhow it was high time the boy was salted	391.7769294334531
10745. jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved	because patterns kept shifting- abc vs d then bcd	vs a h or ab vs cd or ad	vs	cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each	other	4484.93369403045
10746. this continued most of the week following that ill-starred	trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually	in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead	had he not seen it before	6318.132575099879
10747. jubal would not have minded it if service	had not gone to pieces	787.9514114850947
10748. the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing	in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied	to cook much less be secretaries	4437.896982061835
10749. even rock-steady anne- hell	anne was the worst! absent-minded subject to unexplained tears	h jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the	second coming she would memorize date time personae events and	barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes	4604.867482683515
10750. the expense and time involved are astronomical	140.30977920948368
10751. however we sent a third	vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two	1418.8557813669916
10752. we	have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago;	that is all i can tell you about them	3047.7652895763085
10753. but the third ship	came back several years ago and reported h   that it	had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already	inhabited by sentient beings! said hal forgetting in his enthusiasm	that he had not been asked to speak	4686.552018735219
10754. macneff stopped	pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes	960.8136799621025
10755. how did you	know	2.962337103120379
10756. he said sharply	0.30041514999999996
10757. forgive me sandalphon	said hal	14.802644534300748
10758. but it was inevitable! did not the forerunner predict	in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found	3491.0123582231454
10759. i believe it was on page 573!   macneff smiled and	said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression	2310.5216989644027
10760. how could they not	4.406194923657415
10761. thought hal	0.20041515
10762. besides they	were not the only impressions	141.10352493462608
10763. i still bear scars on my back where	pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons	well enough	2174.986147024593
10764. he was a good impresser that pornsen	139.3077046674545
10765. was	0.20041515
10766. is!	as i	grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was	1643.4007174245223
10767. he was	my gapt in the creche	93.72323244166539
10768. he was the dormitory gapt when i went	to college and thought i was getting away from him	2351.338834306923
10769. he is now my block	gapt	43.31832557233361
10770. he is the one responsible for my getting such low m	r's	964.5257127936077
10771. swiftly came the revulsion the protest	43.83653013992725
10772. no not	he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me	1640.194382032664
10773. if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or	my dark self does	2038.616953471471
10774. if i die i die because i willed it so	559.4432876659178
10775. so forgive	me sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!   please	pardon me again sandalphon said hal	1096.6445163094577
10776. but did the expedition	find any records of the forerunner having been on this planet	1641.1837364783162
10777. perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner	himself	786.5160250212721
10778. no said macneff	0.30041514999999996
10779. though that does	not mean that there may not be such records there	778.8325223468435
10780. the expedition	was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return	to earth	2346.057892200146
10781. i can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what	star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in	this hemisphere	2988.739561648363
10782. if you volunteer you will be told where you're going	after the ship leaves	1410.150581728372
10783. and it leaves very soon	14.804452536757589
10784. you	need a linguist	4.45645147699639
10785. said hal	0.20041515
10786. the ship is huge said	macneff but the number of military men and specialists we are taking	limits the linguists to one	3274.2984947121026
10787. we have considered several of your	professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion	936.968767550137
10788. unfortunately	h   hal waited: macneff paced some more frowning	395.3814782763844
10789. then he said unfortunately only one lamechian linguist	exists and he is too old for this expedition	1425.628905003337
10790. therefore h	a thousand pardons said hal	141.15635663822295
10791. but i have just thought	of one thing	167.578092933456
10792. no problem at all	said macneff	65.25852313181613
10793. there will be no women aboard the gabriel	167.0274600686498
10794. and	if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce	1188.1440039122149
10795. hal gasped and he said a divorce	94.38857239300424
10796. macneff raised	his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course	961.9297002992018
10797. but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites	believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made	reference to and provision for divorce	2726.968724038328
10798. it's inevitable in this case	for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years	2112.893583010518
10799. naturally	he couched the provision in obscure language	167.530711534166
10800. in his great	and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not	be able to read therein what we planned	3465.4889148989014
10801. tell me more sandalphon	2.9677795296206404
10802. six months later	hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and	watched the ball of earth dwindle above him	3257.5958615826717
10803. it was night on this hemisphere	but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia	japan china southeast asia india siberia	2039.4004638408496
10804. hal the linguist	saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken	therein	1876.9875972972254
10805. australia the philippine islands japan and northern	china were inhabited by those members of the haijac union that spoke	american	1875.3754053199518
10806. southern china all of southeast asia southern	india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar	2351.2640190062275
10807. his mind turned the globe	swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south	of the sahara sea	1881.9666752229095
10808. all around the mediterranean sea asia minor	northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue	1887.9189877998458
10809. in	southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandic-speaking	peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory	called march	2450.876014537592
10810. this was no man's land disputed by the haijac	union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for	the last two hundred years	3917.423646693249
10811. neither nation would give up their claim	on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second	apocalyptic war	2446.9873101922035
10812. so for all practical purposes it was an independent	nation and by now had its own organized government		1478.3805242732353
10813. its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving	tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary	was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could	be contained on half a sheet of paper	4309.002768219785
10814. hal saw in his mind	the rest of earth: iceland greenland the caribbean islands	and the eastern half of south america	3059.6431032614323
10815. here the peoples spoke the tongue	of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiian-americans	who were busy resettling north america and the western	half of south america after the apocalyptic war	3769.9728220474362
10816. then	there was north america where american was the native speech of all	except the twenty descendants of french-canadians living on the hudson	bay preserve	3905.055528923048
10817. hal knew that when that side of earth	rotated into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space	1887.1342478705615
10818. and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment	392.5155181756148
10819. but mary	would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a	few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to	tahiti	3435.988209333237
10820. she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him	in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed	3482.8921218367736
10821. her friends	and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she	had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man	who thought unrealistically	3095.7638028595393
10822. if hal yarrow had been killed in a	crash he must have wanted it that way	1877.3853870399385
10823. there was no such thing as an	accident	168.3705743541683
10824. somehow all the other passengers	have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance	had simultaneously agreed	to die	3473.956948439144
10825. and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated	and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony	1886.7581954049406
10826. no the fish	could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared	964.4479442386549
10827. hal felt	sorry for mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his	own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome	3000.4252249970496
10828. yet	he told himself this was the best way	391.49845348428755
10829. he and mary would no longer	have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be	over	1888.9920346460324
10830. mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had	secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her	marriage	3691.8076892070335
10831. she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose	a mate from a list selected by her gapt	2328.3278181182654
10832. perhaps the psychological	barriers that had prevented her from conceiving hal's child would	no longer be present	2119.089839914514
10833. hal doubted if this happy event	would occur	167.83919074886649
10834. mary was as frozen below the navel as he	394.62152354149623
10835. no matter who	the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt h   the	gapt	946.3713385580608
10836. he would no longer have to see that fat face hear	that whining voice h   hal yarrow! said the whining	voice	3047.0178027538427
10837. and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned	260.4453394881375
10838. there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly	up at him	751.4418046126511
10839. my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the	whining voice	375.9022451861072
10840. i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious	voyage	1178.5323575787002
10841. but i might have known! we seem to be bound by love;	sigmen himself must have foreseen it	1565.333312860727
10842. love to you my ward	22.1223591288882
10843. sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking	261.75558208039894
10844. how	wonderful to see your cherished self	141.48287384898038
10845. i had thought we would never	again speak to each other	501.11450900839225
10846. the gabriel pointed	towards her destination and under one-gee acceleration began to build	up towards her ultimate velocity 99	2582.707275352408
10847. 1 percent of the speed of light	94.43945274989177
10848. meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out	the performance of the ship went into the suspensor	2817.3368112968647
10849. here they would	lie in suspended animation for many years	372.442296435256
10850. some time later after	a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join	the others	2599.4187277378082
10851. they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase	the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel	could not have endured	2601.0035812328556
10852. upon reaching the desired speed the	automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty	vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end	4847.046721647115
10853. many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of	the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration	2310.3307549905685
10854. again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure	would be applied	1178.8982254416937
10855. then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive	would adjust to a one-gee deceleration	946.1536056571722
10856. and the crew would be automatically	brought out of their suspended animation	956.9050368795449
10857. these members would	then unthaw the rest of the personnel	373.1553651440674
10858. and in the half-year left	before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever	preparations were needed	2360.5570848818234
10859. hal yarrow was among the last to go	into the suspensor and among the first to come out	1580.718192272286
10860. he had to study	the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo	1881.457042974831
10861. and from the first he faced a difficult task	262.6948134044224
10862. the expedition that	had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo	words with an equal number of american words	3042.401062958721
10863. the description of	the siddo syntax was very restricted	262.3356901202843
10864. and as hal found out obviously	mistaken in many cases	560.4090537096042
10865. this discovery caused hal anxiety	14.808076543523267
10866. his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel	of the gabriel how to speak ozagen	3029.5221999491923
10867. yet if he used all of the	little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students	wrongly	1725.165807751911
10868. moreover even getting this across would be difficult	248.40597796047012
10869. for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed	somewhat from earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were	therefore dissimilar	2451.545714229419
10870. it was true that they could be approximated	but would the ozagenians understand these approximations	1659.0971718188168
10871. another	obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo	167.73286618592266
10872. instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached	particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different	word	3295.440977401014
10873. thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai	meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksu'u'peli'afo	and in the future mai'teipa	1879.6030222426896
10874. the same use of	an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses	1403.6577064987991
10875. plus the	fact that siddo not only had the normal three genders	of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and	spiritual	2602.0233896876916
10876. fortunately gender was inflected though the expression	of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo	2353.1107452210094
10877. the system	of indicating gender varied according to tense	263.7070509661849
10878. all the other	parts of speech: nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions	operated under the same system as the verbs	2821.5272033484407
10879. this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical	or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already	established premise	2873.795793546955
10880. no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing	as fast as any computer	1638.110004259599
10881. what gabriel was being asked to do	now however was to re-examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments	on them and give them new and different powers in his mind	to govern his motives	3644.8323194826576
10882. this is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer	cannot do it all- and even in an angel it takes time	3052.62121110884
10883. perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been	being reasonably sure of the	reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long	to jack	3313.9387461352662
10884. he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers	to questions almost before jack could get them asked	2580.1446170478816
10885. there	was nothing he could do but wait	168.51180886713692
10886. at	last gabriel spoke	4.432541633438945
10887. we misjudged you he said slowly	43.46538636358367
10888. we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had	time to develop a sense of justice	2814.8844599182253
10889. of course we have before us the	example of the great races at the galactic center; individually they	are nearly as mortal as you- the difference does not seem very marked	to us where it exists	3868.913848589304
10890. but they have survived for long periods as	races whereas you are young	1184.6278360840527
10891. we shall recommend to them that	they shorten your trial period by half	782.2010420448262
10892. for now it is clear	that we were in the wrong	750.2030301778456
10893. you may reclaim your property and the	penalty on hesperus is lifted	647.0074849164124
10894. i	did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born	hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack	taught me called a deal	4081.8969415221386
10895. nevertheless you were its	agent	14.70079960209959
10896. jack what is the nature of this concept	249.5755820252091
10897. it's	a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other	jack said	1246.1059384883313
10898. we regard it as fair only when each party feels	that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what	he has given	4111.746052134232
10899. his heart he discovered was pounding	43.146628299715395
10900. for	instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed	to take him to earth	2346.205211021394
10901. between individuals this process is called	bargaining	93.37609757041182
10902. when it is done between races or nations it is called	making a treaty	1414.7618217960778
10903. and the major part of my mission to your nest is to	make a treaty between your race and mine	1872.212229807566
10904. recovering the property was	much less important	138.5873363419072
10905. and	apparently impossible	0.20041515
10906. though it might be that we would have much to	give you you have nothing to give us	2356.060417454459
10907. hesperus and lucifer	jack said show that we do	261.07086206381985
10908. another pause;	but this one was not nearly as long	561.3536645141664
10909. then it is a matter of	pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive time	943.0638404438693
10910. yes those could	be commodities under this concept	248.577035429781
10911. but you should understand jack	that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery	1250.3263838801695
10912. visiting	the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older	2107.8176901540196
10913. this explained a great deal	14.913243938569261
10914. all the more reason	then jack said why we must have a treaty	1171.7111341429732
10915. we will gladly entertain	your young and give them proper living quarters in return for	their help in running our fusion reactors	2179.5649636113994
10916. but we must know if this	is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they	will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt	5004.043644349963
10917. but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the	dictates of their own natures and respect yours in turn	2021.1431370146397
10918. to this	we	of course agree	65.33744944709176
10919. jack felt a wave of complete elation but	in a second it had vanished without a trace	1409.9235748408678
10920. what gabriel was asking	was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract	to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless	of the applicable earth laws	5328.416344840144
10921. the angels in turn would exercise	similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures	of the earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse	habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own	preferences and violations of his nature	4673.260413106041
10922. the simple treaty principle	that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing	less than total trust	2574.201459434508
10923. and it might	be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking	of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less	might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war	3833.272592391661
10924. furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of	jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could	ever be codified	3888.544389022509
10925. almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward	suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all	outsiders	1885.546098753453
10926. yet there was some precedent for it	140.81530452264022
10927. the history of	disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal;	but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics	nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and	a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on	this limited question	4761.361449476743
10928. out of that agreement though not by any easy	road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations;	suspicion between member states still existed but it was of	about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry	between arizona and california over water supplies	7241.587735761837
10929. besides	agreements in principle with the petty details to be thrashed	out later were commonplace in diplomatic history	1565.6013256531196
10930. the trouble with	them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in	principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither	party really wanted the quarrel settled	5299.929965130647
10931. suppose that this one	were to work	93.99241288209531
10932. there was no question in jack's mind of the good	faith on one side at least	1879.2931564958392
10933. if mankind could be convinced of that h	it was worth trying	638.0941686786076
10934. in fact it had to be tried	140.33938420987474
10935. it would	be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had	ever signed	1408.8577384732037
10936. secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to	be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there	was no small way to handle this one	4448.121571118371
10937. he turned back to the	screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips	786.3523377721156
10938. but he was too late	22.31757509696113
10939. he had lost his audience	14.880650431616843
10940. for a moment he could make no	sense at all of what he saw	1408.8096171948673
10941. it seemed to be only a riot of color light	and meaningless activity	788.7057611861271
10942. gradually he realized that the pentagon	of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of	the nursery had been broken up	3706.6367680270932
10943. the angels in the nursery were zigzagging	wildly in all directions seemingly at random	943.5973484077028
10944. hesperus!	what's going on here	22.2877574329354
10945. what's happened	0.20041515
10946. your	brothers have been found	22.222761697678045
10947. they are on their way here	43.52213990681072
10948. where	0.30041514999999996
10949. i don't see them	2.939126176137536
10950. the instruments don't show them	22.27636765695411
10951. you can't see them yet jack	43.038821153369206
10952. they'll be in range	in a short while	248.53973792907746
10953. jack scanned the skies the boards and	the skies again	374.2909562835365
10954. no- there was a tiny pip on the radar;	and it was getting bigger rapidly	1642.6578897678137
10955. if that was the skiff it was making	unprecedented speed	374.2967509431196
10956. then the skiff hove into sight just	a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks	of the coal sack	3707.5170351865518
10957. through the telescope jack could see that	both spacesuits were still attached to it	933.8184325422819
10958. the sail was still unfurled	though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted	would be the case by now	3683.7489763127755
10959. it was a startling almost numenous	sight; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an	enormous comet's-tail of angels	2319.4062611640156
10960. the skiff was not heading	for the nursery however	390.8169840142235
10961. it seemed unlikely that her crew if either	of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing	her at a distance of nearly a light-year	3095.4100088683845
10962. and there would be no	chance of signaling them- without the nernst generator jack could	not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by	the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone	6541.371887630262
10963. fuming helpless he watched them pass him	94.00437213456745
10964. the sail ragged	though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of	power being poured out from the nursery stars	3894.659942009291
10965. he would never have believed	without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so	fast	1411.4820335587688
10966. but where was it going	22.06047549866829
10967. and why was it causing so much	agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them	1719.263923635496
10968. there was only one possible answer but jack's horrified	mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's	course into the computer	4483.1747313240685
10969. the curve on the card the computer	spat back at him couldn't be argued with however	1256.4170880321217
10970. the skiff	was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward that place which	jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core	of the angel's life and religion	5335.924655202798
10971. it was clear that langer	had at last found a way to attract the angel's attention	1251.871113614185
10972. it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off	1175.5949450372914
10973. langer would have to be headed off whether	he knew where he was going or not	1255.1690587036333
10974. almost surely he did; after all	he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and	he was an almost frighteningly observant man	4683.597865377157
10975. but not having talked	to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along	the line	1883.6665773952634
10976. had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud	was	a center of government instead of a center of life and faith	3478.8989531141647
10977. but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy	of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident	2315.4440831746965
10978. if	it was intentional it was now also unnecessary; and whether intentional	or not the outcome would be disastrous	2610.815403901518
10979. jack crawled under	the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from	the nernst generator switch	2030.245184896469
10980. when he was back on his feet again	and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated	2119.0435733340464
10981. he had	to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have	it fast	1728.1009819618164
10982. but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered	all the trouble in the first place- and he already had an angel aboard	3904.479528021224
10983. i'm	going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do	789.2942599505798
10984. but i can't	take you to earth yet	249.66144797809125
10985. first i've got to intercept my brothers	before they get any deeper into trouble	931.7843969125524
10986. will you obstruct this	or will you help	252.45381696400432
10987. i know it's not part of the bargain and your	elders might not like it	1093.929535392975
10988. nobody else can live in your	hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly	1633.2406501396058
10989. as for my elders	they have already admitted that they were wrong	633.9059426334904
10990. if because of	this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted	to go there at all	2802.285266907117
10991. therefore of course i will help	43.59337173851009
10992. with	a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in and threw	the switch	1889.087289985277
10993. without an instant's transition the green light that	meant full fusion power winked on the board	1256.9740231874412
10994. always before it had	taken five minutes to-   of course	559.1810249180123
10995. from	here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space	cruiser man had ever dreamed of	1871.4464064650515
10996. but since he had failed to	anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept	orbit	2587.0115348231384
10997. hesperus don't use this t-tau vector	trick of yours please	369.3869670710923
10998. ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow	747.4141206436097
10999. he rubbed	his eyes sleepily with one huge paw	263.7901203993982
11000. ekstrohm nogol you guys	okay	22.221391111276564
11001. nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured	nogol said	372.3332505689176
11002. he didn't say what would cure him; he had been	explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself	3705.7921482784645
11003. his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face	639.7666249263514
11004. well let's	take a ground-level look at the country around here	759.2619046818786
11005. the facsiport rolled open on the landscape	94.13283484581127
11006. a range of bluffs	hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss	959.2381300011842
11007. above them the sky	was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above	minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow	2463.9083783438314
11008. that cold empty sky was	full of fire and light	560.495918461498
11009. it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy	itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer	1734.2204194796645
11010. this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets	almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system	3047.12563130676
11011. these	planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere	640.8135666140205
11012. but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of	them did	1632.0727988071403
11013. this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids	of yancy-6 in three generations	1093.5112911233894
11014. they lay months away from the nearest	earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for	although it was felt that they would probably be good for something	if it could only be discovered- much like the continent of antarctica	in ancient history	7222.54789747428
11015. how can a planet with so many neighbors	be so lonely	506.11402174222684
11016. ryan asked	0.30041514999999996
11017. he was the captain so he could	ask questions like that	505.60008986026116
11018. some can be lonely in a crowd	nogol said elaborately	560.7691068069273
11019. what will we need outside ryan	43.50092169616428
11020. ekstrohm asked	0.30041514999999996
11021. no helmets the captain answered	14.917499169533752
11022. we can breathe out there all right	139.44024785625197
11023. it just won't be easy	14.906591365641333
11024. this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago	1175.6360854424372
11025. nitrogen	and oxygen are about it	43.54677644404998
11026. ryan look over there	nogol said	64.75890276575426
11027. think they're intelligent	maybe hostile	14.819150232824063
11028. i think they're dead ekstrohm	interjected quietly	141.06512573189923
11029. i get no readings from them at all	167.0771590983309
11030. sonic	electronic galvanic- all blank	22.049154044721664
11031. according to these needles they're	stone dead	93.35506890388062
11032. ekstrohm you and i will have a look	ryan said	563.5209806322662
11033. you hold down the fort nogol	43.68240415499134
11034. easy nogol confirmed	0.30041514999999996
11035. i heard a story once about	a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't	get an encephalographic reading on him	2607.3501040124474
11036. me i know the mind	of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner	1655.6958577197543
11037. i'm	not worried about you mis-reading the dials nogol just about	a lug like you reading them at all	1743.0086685373644
11038. remember when the little hand	is straight up that's negative	564.569401432694
11039. positive results start when it goes	towards the hand you use to make your mark	1091.902585740601
11040. ryan told him what he could do then	251.3043805784946
11041. ekstrohm	smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only	a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall	1896.3802250469812
11042. the strong negative field	his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects	1649.9426566695656
11043. actually	the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal	were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years	adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories	3543.845795951615
11044. he wasn't	likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever	1182.495460939876
11045. they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only	a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped	to the ground	2750.1138113202414
11046. it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts	were sharp between light and shadow	1648.5334427579753
11047. they walked from midnight	to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side	1562.4724305438535
11048. ekstrohm nudged it with a boot	65.16506978497203
11049. hey this is pretty close	to a wart-hog	168.08898093262894
11050. one of the	best matches i've ever found	251.81053677473247
11051. well it has to happen	14.706650111449367
11052. still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to	find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world	2843.008207468042
11053. it makes	you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke and	somebody has been everywhere before you even started	2195.7395751771705
11054. the	surveyor looked sidewise at the captain	141.68007998950222
11055. the big man seldom	gave out with such thoughts	259.3322359604917
11056. what shall	we do with this one	141.554138755206
11057. dissect it	0.20041515
11058. ryan nudged it with	his toe following ekstrohm's example	393.341823681936
11059. it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species	to me	787.9642542041844
11060. no hands for one thing	22.43251967102711
11061. of course that's not definite	proof	43.77256473382849
11062. no it isn't ekstrohm said	22.167156004822196
11063. i	think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological	setup around here	1725.2026062751975
11064. in the meantime we might be thinking on	the problem all these dead beasts represent	1649.040311958448
11065. what killed them	0.20041515
11066. it looks like we did when we made blastdown	390.5565237285297
11067. but	what about our landing was lethal to the creatures	373.2697372119777
11068. radiation	0.30041514999999996
11069. ekstrohm suggested	0.20041515
11070. the planet is very low	in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield	out most of the solar output	3263.41458524473
11071. any little dose of radiation might knock	off these critters	374.5010347191327
11072. i don't know about that	22.22450276066076
11073. maybe	it would work the other way	94.2401570828512
11074. maybe because they have had virtually	no radioactive exposure and don't have any r's stored up they	could take a lot without harm	3474.397114962295
11075. then maybe it was the	shockwave we set up	260.9491032641328
11076. or maybe it's sheer xenophobia	22.04721358911626
11077. they curl	up and die at the sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship	1262.8806713248637
11078. at this stage	of the game anything could be possible	560.9071070610847
11079. but there's one possibility	i particularly don't like	166.87256702199457
11080. and that is	0.30041514999999996
11081. suppose it was not us	that killed these aliens	260.0763882950019
11082. suppose it is something	right on the planet native to it	755.2904642931525
11083. i just hope it doesn't work	on earthmen too	261.52397533526374
11084. these critters went real sudden	22.153472590615557
11085. ekstrohm	lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet	503.3720278990555
11086. the	earthmen made camp outside the spaceship	142.1442670496886
11087. there was no reason to leave	the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with	a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out	3083.134316734258
11088. the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy	web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being	3480.707764632836
11089. each	man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced	intimacy on board the ship	1730.7339547654537
11090. ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened	to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138	1894.8395241993476
11091. there was a keening	of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground	792.1312985035725
11092. insects there were on	the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive	and thaw in the morning sun	3497.073457812689
11093. the bunk he lay on was much more	uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board	1100.0922807837235
11094. yet he knew the	others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their	contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high	vacuum	4663.1733292606805
11095. now there could be an	end to pretending	166.65786460310497
11096. he threw off the light blanket and swung	his feet off the bunk to the floor	1892.5244895219373
11097. there	was no longer any need to hide	165.17278871543482
11098. but what was there to do	65.14729266362714
11099. what had	changed for him	14.842089021411175
11100. he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night	his eyes closed pretending to sleep	2121.553601910398
11101. in privacy he could walk	around leave the light on read	503.98082213154294
11102. it was small comfort for insomnia	65.11375545873749
11103. some doctors had informed him he	was mistaken about this	375.94818113425424
11104. actually they said he did sleep but so shortly	and fitfully that he forgot	1409.8804449367121
11105. others admitted he was absolutely	correct- he never slept	261.566718975651
11106. his body processes only slowed down enough	for him to dispell fatigue poisons	1179.3954582137005
11107. occasionally he fell into a	waking gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept	647.1564986067161
11108. naturally he couldn't let his shipmates know this	249.29485134153023
11109. insomnia	would ground him from the exploration service on physiological	if not psychological grounds	947.2638951668721
11110. he had to hide it	22.030668255237654
11111. over the	years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide	1263.3016283514503
11112. the buddies invariably took advantage of him	140.64926118535783
11113. since he couldn't	sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write	their reports	1578.5573260863594
11114. where the hell did he get off threatening to report	any laxness on their part to the captain	2340.994942217665
11115. a man with insomnia had	better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him	1867.986756941716
11116. ekstrohm had to hide his secret	64.7373133756569
11117. in a camp instead of	shipboard hiding the secret was easier	502.5309499721079
11118. but the secret itself was	just as hard	250.6612990989741
11119. ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the	ship's library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert	on sex	2041.5695893195887
11120. he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated	nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn't seem to concentrate	on the weighty pontifical ponderous style	4481.998396832892
11121. on impulse	he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the	hatch of the bubble	1734.6584102325603
11122. ekstrohm walked through the alien glass	and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility	of the thin air	3057.341802722435
11123. behind him his mates stirred without	waking	94.06783867156862
11124. ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a	banging on the hatch of his bubble	1648.1953213604252
11125. it took him a few seconds to put	his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been	resting sleeplessly	2743.7993434666187
11126. the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted	him	249.5924005030321
11127. okay stormy this isn't the place for fun and games	375.4315413690378
11128. what did you do with them	65.30669959767282
11129. do with what	0.20041515
11130. the dead beasties	0.30041514999999996
11131. all the dead animals laying around the ship	168.14093821927364
11132. what are you talking about ryan	65.59075028061264
11133. what do you think i	did with them	165.92901936492441
11134. i don't know	0.30041514999999996
11135. all i know is that they	are gone	165.7102979071051
11136. gone	0.30041514999999996
11137. ekstrohm shouldered	his way outside and scanned the veldt	261.3878303397436
11138. there was no ring of animal	corpses	139.5156299719142
11139. nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen	breeze	260.57766742200914
11140. i'll be damned ekstrohm said	22.167156004822196
11141. you	are right now buddy	14.852108390094935
11142. expe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary	evidence	250.07093021505656
11143. where do you get off ryan	43.496648280216874
11144. ekstrohm	demanded	0.30041514999999996
11145. why pick me for your patsy	43.242043277131515
11146. this has got to be some	kind of local phenomenon	558.1476633031798
11147. why accuse a shipmate of being behind this	166.11270755402816
11148. listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of	every doubt	959.644875085304
11149. but you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor you know	504.5909641931081
11150. you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that	1191.2088368505815
11151. no ekstrohm said no i didn't know that	166.61941819322084
11152. you've been hiding things from me and nogol every jump	we've made with you	1425.5566156226682
11153. now comes this! it fits the pattern of secrecy	and stealth you've been involved in	1098.6450157078366
11154. what could i	do with your lousy dead bodies	395.06618058788473
11155. what would i want with them	43.11715589971884
11156. all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night	and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm	web	4470.733595824583
11157. now all the bodies are missing like they	got up and walked away	793.2586270763824
11158. it was not a new experience to ekstrohm	249.86534606512413
11159. suspicion wasn't new to him at all	93.37133065195076
11160. ryan	there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies	754.1489560814837
11161. look	for them will you	14.976273994127649
11162. i give you my word i'm not trying to pull	some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition	3250.0772198798218
11163. take my word can't you	14.944750198840046
11164. ryan shook his head	4.451508946248309
11165. i don't	think i can	14.895302983964285
11166. there's still such a thing as mental illness	253.42934633748246
11167. you	may not be responsible	14.846738668316783
11168. don't	try anything violent stormy	22.32214491297606
11169. i outweigh you fifty pounds and	i'm fast for a big man	640.4171833657199
11170. i wasn't planning on jumping	you	65.76917833319439
11171. why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong	789.1221479440418
11172. she lived and was given a name	141.98887270180157
11173. for her first three vegetable	months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed	feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant	2586.223150404218
11174. she was not alone	for there were three other such children in the big city's special	nursery	2113.6833447256395
11175. soon they all were removed to central laboratory school	where their delicate transformation began	943.4406885886726
11176. one of the babies	died in the initial transferral but of helva's class seventeen	thrived in the metal shells	2583.0869584042835
11177. instead of kicking feet helva's	neural responses started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands	she manipulated mechanical extensions	1716.942795835227
11178. as she matured more and more	neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went	into the maintenance and running of a space ship	4118.336294365743
11179. for helva was	destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a	man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half	2870.8707596090867
11180. she would be	among the elite of her kind	390.38187014496134
11181. her initial intelligence tests registered	above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high	941.8194795842367
11182. as long	as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there	were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live	a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have	faced as an ordinary normal being	6838.156221909792
11183. however no diagram	of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential	facts about helva that central must eventually learn	2172.4330205257543
11184. they	would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive	doses of shell-psychology would suffice her too as the necessary	bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession	5625.668511050847
11185. a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with	the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships	2731.397529427268
11186. brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages	559.6992306961708
11187. most	babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept	their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller	to larger shells	2321.649023683019
11188. and very very few were lost when the final connection	was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine	3026.380145698108
11189. shell	people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities	were but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places	with the most perfect body in the universe	3098.2868920052415
11190. so for happy years	helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such	games as stall power-seek studying her lessons in trajectory	propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic	alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes: all	the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical	informed citizen	7707.260374839204
11191. not so obvious to her but of more importance	to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as	easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid	2834.8854414237585
11192. she would one day be grateful	to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction	1403.448460873883
11193. helva's civilization was not without busy do-good associations	exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial	citizens	1579.854563224581
11194. one such group got all incensed over shelled children	when helva was just turning fourteen	1655.3225753489835
11195. when they were forced	to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory	schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the	members case histories complete with photographs	3776.5707487840546
11196. very few committees	ever looked past the first few photos	562.9378172810506
11197. most of their original objections	about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous	bodies were mercifully concealed	1727.7346864843798
11198. helva's	class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program	1182.6394205373838
11199. she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later	use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel	2303.4336165804766
11200. her	subject	was large- a copy of the last supper- and her canvas small-	the head of a tiny screw	2819.173678312066
11201. she had tuned her sight to the proper	degree	261.7406818745993
11202. as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious	sound	562.946484861727
11203. shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound	issued through microphones rather than mouths	1416.8693741357795
11204. helva's hum then	had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic	wanderings	2118.6492412437556
11205. why what a lovely voice you have	said one of the female visitors	790.7349228927512
11206. helva looked up and caught	a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface	2122.3812602365024
11207. her hum became a gurgle of surprise	93.5822476698812
11208. she instinctively regulated	her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores	assumed normal proportions	2367.7761639068167
11209. yes we have quite a few years	of voice training madam remarked helva calmly	943.4470821755242
11210. vocal peculiarities	often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar	distances and must be eliminated	1408.435520713255
11211. although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled	people she took this experience calmly	1416.4021398047264
11212. any other reaction would have	been reported instantly	252.17443794392648
11213. i meant that you have a nice singing	voice h dear the lady amended	951.5436361454098
11214. would	you like to see my work	141.197838309343
11215. helva asked politely	0.20041515
11216. she instinctively	sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away	for further meditation	1892.897392528359
11217. i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw	789.8065178767713
11218. o i say the lady twittered	65.05024160286332
11219. helva turned	her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically	640.235318373512
11220. of course some of my color values do not match the old master's	and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair	copy	4285.003359940449
11221. the lady's eyes unmagnified bugged out	43.221101069785874
11222. oh i forget and helva's voice was really contrite	391.6869469557877
11223. if she	could have blushed she would have	167.55992935168226
11224. you people don't have adjustable	vision	64.86343443998051
11225. the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride	and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate	1575.9013952620492
11226. here this will help suggested helva substituting	a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture	2602.5373304275213
11227. in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee	bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last	supper on the head of a screw	3113.6117653763113
11228. well remarked one gentleman	who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can	eat where angels fear to tread	3258.0845221467175
11229. are you referring sir	asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number	of angels who could stand on the head of a pin	2731.22242749921
11230. i had	that in mind	22.308653735942222
11231. if you substitute 'atom' for 'angel'	the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the	pin in question	1895.8337532631826
11232. which you are programed to compute	65.28613482436128
11233. of course	0.20041515
11234. did they remember to program a	sense of humor as well young lady	1191.609491644409
11235. we are directed	to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect	1093.8675272101013
11236. the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip	was worth his time	1182.4188637634545
11237. if the investigation committee spent months	digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school	they left helva with a morsel as well	2461.580500491231
11238. singing as	applicable to herself required research	139.57954931302802
11239. she had of course been exposed	to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the	better known classical works such as tristan und isolde candide	oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singers	eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd as well	as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians capellan visual	chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians	5638.303045505339
11240. but singing	for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties	to be overcome	1182.4144076025973
11241. shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of	a problem or situation before making a prognosis	1423.531155466611
11242. balanced properly	between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell	people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel	from bizarre situations	3894.297480043371
11243. therefore to helva the problem that she	couldn't open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not	bother her	1873.3760188028148
11244. she would work out a method by-passing her limitations	whereby she could sing	1184.956560262757
11245. she approached the problem by investigating	the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and	instrumental	1415.8481924900939
11246. her own sound production equipment was essentially more	instrumental than vocal	749.566741379195
11247. breath control and the proper enunciation	of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most	development and practice	2035.117876844942
11248. shell people did not strictly speaking breathe	140.20973511248837
11249. for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from	the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained	artificially by solution in their shells	2853.729744893816
11250. after experimentation helva	discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain	tone	1414.242668019034
11251. by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity	well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sounds into	the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat	microphone	3565.636339353071
11252. she compared the results with tape recordings of modern	singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar	quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique	4826.864008764803
11253. acquiring	a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained	to perfect recall	1262.1120376858962
11254. she found herself able to sing any role and any	song which struck her fancy	1639.2832317200518
11255. it would not have occurred to her that	it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo	soprano and coloratura as she pleased	2854.1713197813488
11256. it was to helva only a matter	of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the	music attempted	2610.636542319638
11257. if the authorities remarked on her curious	avocation they did so among themselves	783.6686803041587
11258. shell people were encouraged	to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical	work	2361.8372345446196
11259. on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her	shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship	the xh-834	2022.1490062050893
11260. her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an	even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship	2815.4310376628137
11261. the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and	sealed	501.6445628757125
11262. her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the	final delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva	remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings	3462.6784072448113
11263. when she awoke	she was the ship	93.75830992104733
11264. her brain and intelligence controlled every	function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class	needed	2825.195647672764
11265. she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any	situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any	situation its most fertile minds could imagine	3188.971000868539
11266. her first actual	flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels	since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques	of her profession	4844.712436523669
11267. she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival	of her mobile partner	940.8490291617869
11268. there were nine qualified scouts sitting	around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned	1646.359565284301
11269. there	were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva	had been of interest to several department heads in central for some	time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section	3737.3364956934965
11270. consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective	partners	970.2160606332502
11271. the ship always chose its own partner	94.20976038757937
11272. had there	been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would	have been guided to make the first move	3248.7362809103824
11273. as it was while central wrangled	among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks	out to the field and over to helva's slim metal hull	2858.3932265748344
11274. hello anyone at home	4.427146892561248
11275. tanner wisecracked	0.20041515
11276. of course	replied helva logically activating her outside scanners	390.34822726339644
11277. are	you my partner	2.948608609455461
11278. she asked hopefully as she recognized the	scout service uniform	564.2094668496177
11279. all you have to do is ask he retorted	hopefully	376.04984681149847
11280. i thought perhaps there	were no partners available and i've had no directives from central	1647.9609442678889
11281. even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but	the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field	1889.1893406695792
11282. always	she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians	by the score	1891.8957471632361
11283. the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and	become oppressive	504.57885429015266
11284. no directives from central is scarcely	a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guys biting their	fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you	you beautiful thing	5649.228472305363
11285. it would have killed you in the cabin	167.6780023844876
11286. do you have anything for me	64.6761282074356
11287. mercer stammered not knowing what b'dikkat meant and	the two-nosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head	but it isn't big enough for you to take yet	3455.869659219119
11288. mercer never	noticed the needle touch his arm	250.90298301327826
11289. b'dikkat had turned to	the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer	936.5519757424488
11290. he tried to run after b'dikkat to hug the lead spacesuit to tell	b'dikkat that he loved him	2364.4160472021517
11291. he stumbled and fell but it did not	hurt	259.40122212798116
11292. the many-bodied girl lay near him	65.31277572082487
11293. isn't it wonderful	0.20041515
11294. you're beautiful beautiful beautiful	4.397640444962226
11295. i'm so happy to be here	43.30724464147575
11296. the woman covered with	growing hands came and sat beside them	750.2685247266779
11297. she radiated warmth and good	fellowship	43.42860873437432
11298. mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming	395.8296524027954
11299. he struggled out of his clothes	43.456999145837095
11300. it was foolish and snobbish	to wear clothing when none of these nice people did	1640.697527702415
11301. the two	women babbled and crooned at him	167.21009945760386
11302. with one corner of his mind	he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the euphoria of	a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it	4649.4424004493
11303. with most	of his mind he was happy	167.80104248001732
11304. he wondered how anyone could have the good	luck to visit a planet as nice as this	2136.0223247093973
11305. he tried to tell the lady	da but the words weren't quite straight	792.9063960145534
11306. a painful stab	hit him in the abdomen	250.76967920187025
11307. the drug went after the pain and swallowed it	262.38963102020205
11308. it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better	1188.7254973824834
11309. the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time	642.2438009874402
11310. he forced himself to be deliberate	64.73891693775734
11311. he rammed his mind into focus	and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert	that was a good bite	2734.20744626716
11312. maybe i will grow another head	65.24770746158734
11313. that	would make b'dikkat happy!   the lady da forced the foremost	of her bodies in an upright position	1574.9426672329944
11314. said she i'm strong	too	22.137170882701874
11315. remember man remember	0.20041515
11316. we can die too we can die like real people	564.0703435276454
11317. i do so believe	in death!   mercer smiled at her through his happiness	784.2126850792295
11318. but isn't this nice h   with	this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack	2129.229885947458
11319. he was wide awake	but he did not feel like doing anything	641.4167574263652
11320. in that beautiful place	among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled	1643.9338725668326
11321. b'dikkat was sterilizing his knives	14.883559545124111
11322. mercer wondered	how long the super-condamine had lasted him	394.87463418912387
11323. he endured the ministrations	of the dromozoa without screams or movement	498.98324497607166
11324. the agonies of nerves	and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near	him but meant nothing	2344.9401909988615
11325. he watched his own body with remote casual	interest	262.9307451811668
11326. the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him	564.134830928648
11327. after	a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his	powerful arms	1256.490962291315
11328. having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at	them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged	3064.0489391598594
11329. mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and	opened them to see stars shining	1572.5757370910735
11330. the dromozoa	fed him in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his needs for	cycles of the body	2590.1049841704103
11331. at last he noticed a return of the inwardness	of pain	500.77598729739265
11332. the pains themselves had not changed; he had	251.79581129924617
11333. he knew all the events which could take place on shayol	502.71655948506486
11334. he	remembered them well from his happy period	251.18942200867946
11335. formerly he had noticed	them- now he felt them	260.22128494464073
11336. he tried to ask the lady da how long	they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait	before they had it again	4471.383172763342
11337. she smiled at him with benign remote happiness;	apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had	a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body	3121.3531348799906
11338. she meant	him well but was in no condition for articulate speech	956.3296874712272
11339. the	half-man lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the	half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity	1574.2981252620461
11340. mercer	squeezed the man's shoulder	22.396159909686524
11341. the half-man woke recognized	mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin	641.1816647831629
11342. 'a good	morrow to you my boy'	140.7263681449614
11343. that's out of a play	14.883455258739193
11344. did you ever see	a play	65.66467318502217
11345. you mean a game with cards	43.546605156541276
11346. no	said the half-man a sort of eye-machine with real people doing	the figures	1422.8095346139607
11347. i never saw that said mercer but	i-   but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going	to come back with the needle	2449.3487105472145
11348. yes said mercer a little	ashamed of his obviousness	388.7399339632624
11349. that's why i think of plays	43.52709410098901
11350. we all know what is going to happen	248.97979563520147
11351. we all know when it is going to happen	259.74116299783725
11352. we all know what the dummies	will do- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated	men were cradled- and we all know what the new people will ask	4824.145413298296
11353. but we never know how long a scene is going to take	639.4856021755679
11354. what's	a 'scene'	0.30041514999999996
11355. asked mercer	0.20041515
11356. is that the name for the	needle	141.1351761759207
11357. the half-man laughed with something close to real	humor	262.8884591735289
11358. you've got the lovelies on the brain	141.00716968454782
11359. a	scene is just a part of a play	262.50598113612904
11360. i mean we know the order in which things	happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days	or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of	us know how long anything takes	6429.069423562663
11361. the pain seems short and the pleasure	seems long	261.3351602696821
11362. i'm inclined to think that they are about two earth-weeks	each	750.7401940068008
11363. mercer did not know what an earth-week	was since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction but	he got nothing more from the half-man at that time	3228.848302250742
11364. the half-man received	a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly	at mercer take it out you fool! take it out of me!	when mercer looked on helplessly the half-man twisted over on	his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and	quietly to himself	7514.792619518892
11365. mercer himself could not tell how long it	was before b'dikkat came back	782.5478528507981
11366. it might have been several days	65.08849704656268
11367. it might have been several months	43.428410607617465
11368. once again b'dikkat moved	among them like a father; once again they clustered like children	1652.2514979569482
11369. this time b'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had	grown out of mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's head covered	with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes	3656.5419385777327
11370. mercer got the blissful needle	22.07547270716756
11371. when b'dikkat cut the head	from mercer's thigh he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage	which held the head	to his own body	2477.8691025021544
11372. he saw the child-face grimace	as the head was cut; he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain	as b'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which	stopped all bleeding immediately	5324.681367504016
11373. the next time it was two legs	growing from his chest	501.9049765393852
11374. then there had been another head beside	his own	392.7651879456572
11375. or was that after the torso and legs waist to toe-tips	of the little girl which had grown from his side	2039.9799659695443
11376. he	forgot the order	4.436636673283453
11377. he did not count time	14.80815603070466
11378. lady da smiled	at him often but there was no love in this place	1408.0046920462607
11379. she had lost	the extra torsos	43.86726160442693
11380. in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely	woman; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper	to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and	hope people never live forever	5762.56518942796
11381. she found this immensely	comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it	1250.2244359626159
11382. thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and	new ones arrived	959.7006111266592
11383. sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones resting in	the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains in a ground-truck	to be added to other herds	2464.5945888561896
11384. the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled	without human speech when the dromozoa struck them	1892.1475629292308
11385. finally	mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin	786.099918815688
11386. he	had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it	751.6648530383534
11387. only the memory	of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if	he did not ask b'dikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would	no longer be available when he needed it	3751.5437576837735
11388. fighting pleasure itself	he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long	he had been there	2820.805414280273
11389. b'dikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not	come out of the doorway	637.0476671273987
11390. he spoke through the public address box built	into the cabin and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain	so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their	happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting	to tell them	7018.4752746440545
11391. when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound	though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time	that mercer had been on shayol:   standard years- eighty-four	years seven months three days two hours eleven and one	half minutes	4509.090274275029
11392. mercer turned away	0.30041514999999996
11393. the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness	and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat	1737.300328309031
11394. what persuaded the	cow-man to remain on shayol	249.77715688790636
11395. what kept him happy without super-condamine	43.68571623906656
11396. was b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a	man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded	by a family of little cow-people resembling himself	5637.2563811748
11397. mercer despite	his happiness wept a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat	789.8949433340559
11398. his	own fate he accepted	22.28679052818495
11399. he remembered the last time he had eaten-	actual eggs from an actual pan	951.1437280250078
11400. the dromozoa kept him alive	but he did not know how they did it	1399.0160493069975
11401. he staggered back to the	group	43.58024827005669
11402. the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand	and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her	3888.3337444912504
11403. there	were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated	the kindliness of her gesture none the less	2027.571666352659
11404. the years if they were years went by	248.3686461084962
11405. the land of shayol did not	change	93.19641975646397
11406. sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across	the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it	to be the breathing of captain alvarez	4622.434516266711
11407. there was night and day but	no setting of crops no change of	season no generations of men	1563.7806278017492
11408. time	stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled	with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the	lady da took on very remote meaning	5492.875674489275
11409. her statement was a hope not a truth in which they	could believe	793.0154709577446
11410. they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their	courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience	of each for the wisdom of all	4820.716606892985
11411. there was no dream of escape for these	people	260.4170253177891
11412. though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from	the field beyond b'dikkat's cabin they did not make plans to hide	among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh	4656.569046657557
11413. far long ago some	other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter	1260.6187471490246
11414. his	handwriting was on a rock	65.88040761476839
11415. mercer read it and so had a few of the others	but they could not tell which man had done it	2031.3090441108084
11416. the letter scraped on stone had been a message home	562.8305851613407
11417. they	could still read the opening: once i was like you stepping	out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently	toward the place i lived in	3667.486721941373
11418. once like you i had one head two	hands ten fingers on my hands	1415.8376541220796
11419. the front part of my head was called	a face and i could talk with it	1254.6342874353784
11420. now i can only write and that only	when i get out of pain	1403.5596393827177
11421. dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner	262.2490413705252
11422. he	was well rid of her	64.29623421002862
11423. he certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle	as ann	498.9070524953884
11424. if he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble	747.7250922453788
11425. but all of this was rationalization	43.19904676745814
11426. sometimes he woke up in	the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back	to sleep	3048.045778881433
11427. his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for	so long that now he felt as if he had nothing	2322.834285932984
11428. the easiest thing would	be to sell out to al budd and leave the country but there was	a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it	4252.959737628289
11429. the best antidote	for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard	work	938.565593752556
11430. he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep	simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake	3477.903832457033
11431. each day he found	himself thinking less often of ann; each day the hurt was a little	duller a little less poignant	2170.488362509506
11432. he had plenty of work to do	141.22760503216728
11433. because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a	smaller stream than in ordinary years	1582.653834417139
11434. the grass in the meadows came	fast now that the warm weather was here	1405.4103902463844
11435. he could not afford to lose	a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along	the ditches in his meadows	2734.5195087409775
11436. he had no idea how much time	budd would give him	748.5624264214827
11437. in any case he had no intention of being caught	asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he	took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence	3763.7306355394626
11438. he stopped	every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon	but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm	3891.4890203377713
11439. when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two	people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work	immediately and strode to his rifle	3688.4715398662556
11440. it could be some kind of trick	budd had thought up	748.9846297835651
11441. no one walked in this country least of all	ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew	2454.786871619496
11442. morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled	392.25530712688794
11443. when they were closer	and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever	1574.138740684918

11445. his visitors had crawled through	the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house	1419.8545445397394
11446. now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly	staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their	feet	4283.600772372958
11447. reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his	winchester in his hands	931.175913982501
11448. they crawled through the north fence and came	on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen	or twenty	3912.36273796144
11449. they were dirty their clothes were torn and the	girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from	the front door	2730.07553068203
11450. she lay there making no effort to get back on her	feet	959.0456189665614
11451. the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan	as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring	2604.3230976879486
11452. morgan	hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one	1410.282601106169
11453. he	didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending	635.3706679669353
11454. the	boy licked his dry lips	65.1580016090946
11455. he asked could we have a drink	94.06774009270802
11456. morgan jerked his head toward the front door	251.9484785033767
11457. in the kitchen	he said	14.803317329407358

11460. she didn't move or say anything	65.56955376631142
11461. her eyes were glazed as if	she didn't hear or even see him	797.7845080611803
11462. she had reached a point at which	she didn't even care how she looked	1415.3672761307291
11463. her face was very thin and burned	by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new	skin under it red and angry	2856.290094283592
11464. her blond hair was frowzy her dress	torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out	that they were practically no protection	3870.5162846668545
11465. it must have hurt her even	to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw	that it was bruised and bleeding	2725.693991937375
11466. he picked her up sliding one	hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her	into the house	3026.931856796643
11467. she was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms	that he wasn't even sure she was conscious	1574.642580137892
11468. any lingering suspicion	that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled	1634.7671031222171
11469. no girl	would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him	1102.4950921501018

11471. he put her down on the	couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a	chair beside the table	2479.044130092881
11472. they looked a good deal alike morgan thought	249.2806020020599
11473. both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity	of features	1264.0093559939924
11474. morgan filled the dipper from the water	bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's	head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth	5040.1278438696045

11476. he	stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced	her to this condition	2341.077733022654
11477. he had seen a few nester wagons go through	the country the families almost starving to death but he had never	seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two	3672.3455829692016
11478. the girl	dropped off to sleep	65.43730416132597
11479. morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire	and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured	into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove	3454.3271272168195

11500. could you give us a	job mr h   morgan	392.9617827450867
11501. he was	silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if	the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but	he knew nothing about the couple	3957.8009819311264
11502. they might kill him in his sleep thinking	there was money in the house	1409.2326961210917
11503. he dismissed the possibility at	once	43.3056842295959
11504. the girl's thin face haunted him	65.5526512963086
11505. it wasn't the face of a	killer	93.62245301500491
11506. he wasn't so sure about the boy	141.23530766634232
11507. he hadn't shaved for several	weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression	1257.006354720308

11639. i made you a man	14.854067151527255
11640. he approached the horse and laid a hand on the	stallion's quivering neck	1189.5439448881298
11641. help me up i	feel kind of stiff	166.81573100817099
11642. clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like	a child	568.0911673744351
11643. i hate to leave my garden gavin said	167.10487090135214
11644. i loved my garden	4.451057009743788
11645. it will grow again-	in california	43.500200282261105
11646. i loved this valley he whispered	huskily	139.62180456148033
11647. lived alone here for three years before any man came	371.9568792962579
11648. lived	alone by the river	22.212171852432036
11649. it was nice then so peaceful and quiet	167.56149755907592
11650. there	was no one but me	65.14350185890633
11651. i don't want to leave it	42.96231910514444
11652. clayton	swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump	564.913581571838
11653. the two horses	broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still	burning in the house into the darkness	2473.223526305416
11654. they	rode at a measured pace through the valley	392.4685009925341
11655. dawn would come soon	and the night was at its coldest	502.0432514164546
11656. the moon had sunk below the black crest	of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed	to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever	trespassed before	5788.89938906396
11657. it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago	on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly	to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's	wind- a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be	broken by the will of men	5372.6652636822255
11658. in that inert landscape	the caravan of his desires passed before his mind	1183.1309434838731
11659. he saw them	ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying	947.8491275661647
11660. in vain	his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had	sought so desperately but they would not come to life	3691.1560699828246
11661. the silence oppressed	him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide	from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through	the darkness in its slow search	3966.2362973175213
11662. they passed ranches that	were framed dark gray against the black hills	956.7177780824471
11663. then at last the darkness	began to dissolve	167.2797225871008
11664. a bold line of violet broke loose from the	high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the	last stars from the sky	4295.938228701688
11665. the wan light spread over the ground and the	valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences	and palely shadowed gullies	2606.6550691418042
11666. they had been seen as soon	as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though	watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless	shelter of the trees	6048.721360393769
11667. the two men whipped their horses into town	and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence	1895.8358174745092
11668. the men in pettigrew's were tired from a night's	drinking their faces red and baggy	1644.423643140982
11669. but the liquor had flushed their	courage	94.78899556687932
11670. they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated	of purpose	1184.3468175523412
11671. lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their	desire	375.2332191956444
11672. he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his	cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked	3700.342992650564
11673. that's what you wanted isn't it	43.53832356786456
11674. clayton is with	him takin him out of the valley	559.4039628807528
11675. you can't-   keep out	of this purvis snarled	164.60054711083188
11676. he's not your brother he's gavin's	son	139.46137312881984
11677. you see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone	786.1133536467117
11678. joe purvis was thinking back many years	141.97324240417547
11679. first he thought of	the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being	rustled at the far end of the valley	2848.9441473751062
11680. he remembered gavin's smirk	his own cringing feeling his impotence	563.1257504821641
11681. then he thought of a time	when clayton's horse had fallen lame in the gap	1102.4227013300394
11682. his wife had	said to him: nellie is in love with clayton roy	1185.2015660836373
11683. he wouldn't	even dance with her at gavin's party	259.24731617452494
11684. he treats her like she was	dirt	140.8734957797141
11685. and you stand by like a fool and let him do it h   he	remembered clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked	him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water	3978.1662781975406
11686. it was	the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game	964.2630752052246
11687. you're gavin's	son joe purvis had said	93.48184517750308
11688. you brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find	your boy	1643.0732508488131
11689. he meant to help gavin all the time	167.35043623097405
11690. he made a fool of	you lester	140.2203069241512
11691. he swung round to the other men- we can catch	him easy! there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place	2185.093225130834
11692. if	we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with	them and they'll be back	2813.654068198963
11693. there's only one way they can get out	now and that's through the gap- if we ride hard we can take them	2165.492043403515
11694. lester's hand fluttered to cabot's shoulder	65.17525574518707
11695. he killed tom- do you understand that	94.61668441500113
11696. cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they	would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the	cold of the ebbing night	5354.963943158524
11697. he fled through the door and down the steps	running and the men grunted and followed pushing lester to one	side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised	before his eyes to shut out the light	4389.909966707099
11698. purvis and silas pettigrew	were the last to leave	388.3299662123367
11699. they mounted up and rode slowly behind the	others at a safe distance	791.9840137904608
11700. in the cold dawn	the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind	to leave the valley clear	3684.7534466033967
11701. the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight	swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold	light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams	over the dazzling snow	3965.650502080681
11702. when they turned in the saddle they could	see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line	3469.462803213355
11703. the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered	and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind	2462.2967159768846
11704. the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from	the hoofs of gavin's stallion	2355.467617664829
11705. he looked over his shoulder at the	thin dotting of pursuers	503.65512529172776
11706. they neither gained nor fell back	65.10120164186847
11707. he rode	low on the mare's neck	94.60941934741047
11708. ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the	trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away	2842.964379214056
11709. gavin's	face was bloodless with excitement	43.23409838825624
11710. he did not look back; he	could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out	across the prairie to the north	3884.383710267768
11711. he knew who was riding after him-	the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn	their loyalty to him	2860.6889533392687
11712. now they were riding to kill him	141.35072667459778
11713. and he was	fleeing running- fleeing his death and his life at the same time	1097.9321196081323
11714. the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in:	his valley	2124.398108449457
11715. with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he	crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never	see again	2732.217154465952
11716. the gap looming before him- the place where had confronted	jack english on that day so many years ago- was his exit from	all that had meaning to him	4675.129537336996
11717. california is too far he thought	43.270142541759206
11718. he would never reach california	22.33959266126975
11719. he was too old- when he passed	up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could	see ahead he was passing from life	2860.2260444673398
11720. the sentry was not dead	22.2332633649981
11721. he was in fact showing signs of	reviving	166.2185170079115
11722. he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball	pistol	1197.2944642804368
11723. a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard	93.98997214981405
11724. he was partially	uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat	565.1651848096195
11725. mike stripped these from him	and donned them	168.30902619700433
11726. he and dean tied and gagged the man using his belt	and shirt for the purpose	1888.0474230485997
11727. they dragged him inside the building	43.44928379632955
11728. fiske joined them unsteady on his feet	139.81040243114916
11729. julia seeing the bandage	rushed to him	94.07939243884091
11730. you are hurt! she breathed	22.27917993128893
11731. i	never felt better in my life fiske blustered	261.82865274904384
11732. he turned	to susan and kissed her on the cheek	559.1279791654076
11733. thank you my dear	he	said	43.22245645246005
11734. mike silenced them	0.30041514999999996
11735. first we've got to get out of here	164.796390479737
11736. we'll	grab horses dean said	22.203461769834433
11737. the main bunch is outside but	there are some over there inside the wall	941.645615458483
11738. mike debated it	trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride	1170.4645335396901
11739. but it at	least offered him a chance for living	376.0122149381158
11740. and for	the sake of julia and susan it had to be tried	1180.413716038223
11741. the guerrilla	bivouac	remained silent	14.857738567864283
11742. light showed in the orderly room across the	parade ground	562.6159508058581
11743. someone evidently was on duty there	43.414846928079434
11744. no doubt there	would be men guarding the horses	393.9535499869175
11745. about a dozen animals were	held inside the stockade as best mike could make out in the moonlight	1571.6022018157046
11746. evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available	in an emergency	1409.4981797627206
11747. he handed the guard's rifle to fiske	93.87604667747162
11748. dean	and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said	1171.542602570448

11750. all of you be ready	to ride hell for leather	556.7676119908261
11751. he added if this doesn't	work out the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk	terms with them	2026.2885487357057
11752. he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the	pistol	565.2782577361593
11753. susan halted dean and kissed him	43.685901670738836
11754. she clung to him talking	to him and dabbing at her eyes	964.6206763252374
11755. he was	thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant	what he had believed it had	2038.7291807942845
11756. dean	turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms	751.7012173806291
11757. he kissed her	also and with deep tenderness	168.27033865403035
11758. she too began to weep	22.084543883123807

11760. mike only said	later	4.392943454241879
11761. be careful mclish! susan said	fiercely	43.37238709879877
11762. the way you were careful	22.202036419792478
11763. he snorted	0.20041515
11764. running	around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock	1411.651615454616
11765. he kept going	0.20041515
11766. he wanted no more sentimental scenes with	her	248.83438355784156
11767. he might say or do something foolish	94.72781442482146
11768. something all of them	would regret	65.50700533346578
11769. he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making	of herself pretending to be blind to the way julia fortune had taken	dean's affections from her	2971.47001589264
11770. and using him mike mclish as a	sop to her pride	757.176241155769
11771. he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the	pistol	377.1125617863514

11774. there's bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them	long enough for me to get close	2804.778983359664
11775. holding the pistol concealed	he walked to the rear wall of the stockade	791.3236910548442
11776. it was pierced by	a wagon gate built of two wings	751.0442653246408
11777. mike passed through	it and moved toward the dark mass of horses	640.3673926722244

11781. is that you	bill	2.9301032784560186
11782. he located his man	4.405484280274534
11783. the guard stood in the shadow	of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight	1409.129526704361
11784. mike kept	walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious	and straightened from his lax slouch	2598.693068848058
11785. mike struck with the muzzle	of the pistol	168.35739227405332
11786. but the luck that had been running their way left	him	751.1817528208558
11787. the guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle	262.18415893750296
11788. he tried	to veer the rifle around to fire into mike's body	965.7799408446914
11789. mike	off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded	940.8004776456098
11790. mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash	251.00356772237242
11791. this time it connected solidly on the man's temple felling	him	505.30365827984724
11792. the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls	of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills	3493.490129658637
11793. the	startled horses began rearing on their tethers	168.4183188535393
11794. are you hit	0.30041514999999996
11795. he demanded	0.20041515

11797. there's no chance now of all	of us getting away	370.4331152246883
11798. you'll have to try it alone	64.9660273142392
11799. the	sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy	in case of need	1091.098428170953
11800. mike took the bayonet from dean's hand and	slashed the picket line	962.3667360388415

11802. ride!	dean resisted mike's attempt to push him toward the horse	757.4188016145781
11803. why not you	0.20041515
11804. he protested	0.30041514999999996
11805. you're lighter than me	2.9297641017805476
11806. it's our only chance now	22.17459640300057
11807. try to find these feds	14.922044817975586
11808. the rest of us can fort up in the house	and hang on until you get back	2124.388950821351
11809. you're the one that's taking the	big chance	168.63832794202366
11810. dean still hesitated but mike lifted him almost	bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand	2608.483123616843
11811. no	telling how good this horse is mike panted	262.23529898922607
11812. favor him and	save something in case you hit trouble	557.9156960285203
11813. watch out for apaches when	it comes daylight	166.30311373544905
11814. you might need it	4.39894529706599
11815. we'll still	have the rifle and i might be able to round up some more	1103.2617804622625
11816. i'll	stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you	966.8878895405154
11817. dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back	949.7530435146269
11818. mclish he said as he kicked the horse into motion i'd	be a mighty sad man if we never met again	3058.123690251427
11819. then he was on	his way at a gallop	261.8110731280236
11820. mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes	with the bayonet	753.8332053277691
11821. he lifted a screeching war whoop	43.503565035366435
11822. that touched off	a total stampede	65.69553421414649
11823. he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses	there	378.24980355127525
11824. these poured through the gate and joined the flight	395.6022028412898
11825. the animals	thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges	503.99491729255385
11826. the guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the	enclosure	1423.8356785693593
11827. they're	stealin'	the stock!   he scuttled in shadow along the east wall	of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the	rear of the two frame buildings	3447.6936093745157
11828. his shout	had been taken up and repeated	249.39917271470614

11919. mr manuel whispered in the ears	of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their	horses	1869.1282954329192

11936. for unlike	the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor	are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet	3052.9011601483185
11937. more of an agricultural	nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for	survival in the endless wars of the plains	2471.207304456138

11949. he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle	and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying	to keep them steady under fire	3234.1235344450242
11950. the pony herd was the one	flaw in our defense; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as	many of the animals as possible	3914.505817560084
11951. wildly bucking horses would make the	position difficult to defend against charging warriors	788.3361926033956
11952. the cooks	had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time and	on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day	4304.9075169983225

11955. coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian	scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl	1731.3249234191844
11956. oso	slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms; i didn't catch	a wink	1414.5755935556504

11958. it was a relief when they finally came	249.79737376092416
11959. they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in	a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning	with their spine-chilling scalp cry	3334.896128691294

11979. as	he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse	790.5710204778948
11980. at the last second i dropped my sights	from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony	3271.9007800829104
11981. i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its	head bouncing like a rubber ball	2045.936296925073
11982. he started to run but oso's shot	caught him on the wing	965.5667945647361

11984. if you're goin' to kill 'em- kill 'em! oso	growled	563.5995851892583
11985. what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire	on all sides	930.2941478811426
11986. the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled	and retreated	563.6556732567026

12019. i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by	the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position	2466.622074766386
12020. the ponies were almost uncontrollable	22.094063698334345
12021. the pall of dust	they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again	1252.7766577856107
12022. this time more of them hurdled the barrier	249.225788565411
12023. a small indian dived at	montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt	1570.7614734729857
12024. it sounded like a man kicking a melon	251.490709877669
12025. above me a dark rider was	whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales	1729.395868977351
12026. although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of	me	1642.0105940235535
12027. i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil	94.49036424809637
12028. his eyes were dark	fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in	1884.1238815393888
12029. coming over the	wall he had seemed like a hideous devil	506.16696808667996
12030. now under me i could see	him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint h	3044.7456010219466
12031. the aricaras made one last desperate charge	94.55665868916589
12032. it was pitiful	to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting	their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding	from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient	hawkinses	6485.780964014443
12033. others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees	in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly	wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under	the slashing hoofs	3642.865567426956
12034. some gracefully soared from the backs of their	wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the	lead split their hearts or tore their guts h	4485.807541602464
12035. none of them	reached our walls again	93.07046343145662
12036. the few survivors grudgingly turned away	65.50082165077765
12037. in	the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song	1106.369272068005
12038. she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall	again and dangle from her wrist	3030.0760629256856
12039. i saw your fire she	said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger	1095.072988943133
12040. you	could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size	958.5078188790891
12041. it wouldn't	matter to a fool like you	168.1580460938866
12042. all	right wilson said quickly	22.108240617005972
12043. and i appreciate	the advice	14.801916410892085
12044. he was losing patience again	22.193877829484258
12045. an hour	before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness	he would have appreciated company	1581.5647785824867
12046. she had helped him change his mind	141.13724163440588
12047. i'm not advising you she said	43.6636948076327
12048. that fire's too big	4.438173390089177
12049. and make sure it's out	when you leave in the morning	500.04680009578794
12050. it	took him a long time to compose himself	390.9933112495765
12051. there's some mistake	he said finally	43.3338374935148
12052. you're right about the fire	22.285307464808284
12053. it's bigger	than it has to be though i don't see where it's doing any	harm	1253.8591884373004
12054. but you're wrong about the rest of it	249.80744496921292
12055. i'm not leaving in	the morning	43.59886656383225
12056. why should i	0.30041514999999996
12057. i own the place	2.965399122658009
12058. she showed	her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so	that she could get a better look at his face	3699.248129987096
12059. it didn't seem to tell	her anything	92.79894065467496
12060. she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon	and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the	two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the	far reaches of the firelight	6218.791141818653
12061. she studied it for a long time	93.58241015767496
12062. then	she turned back to wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what	she meant	by it	2348.783909986172
12063. you own this place	2.965399122658009
12064. she said and her tone	had softened until it was almost friendly	958.4354310222088
12065. you bought it	0.20041515
12066. from a man in st louis wilson said	249.3087608071503
12067. the girl laughed	0.20041515
12068. i ought to	0.30041514999999996
12069. my father ran him off here six years ago	263.6776530573755
12070. he stood watching the girl wondering what	was coming next	559.7176819553509
12071. she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around	her wrist and smiling at him	1406.8353901134128
12072. carwood didn't tell you	that she said	140.53366196501443
12073. but it's understandable	0.20041515
12074. it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of	1177.930064383424
12075. and it doesn't make any difference	43.135437878425364
12076. he sold me a clear title	65.51281413129514
12077. i	have it with me right here	93.5153821239083
12078. if you want to see-   never	mind she said sternly	563.3862871294832
12079. it wouldn't matter to my father	and not to me	370.81224484255875
12080. i meant what i said about that fire	249.526483812477
12081. be sure it's	out when you leave	93.35757565952777
12082. i'll let you go back to doing the	dishes now	567.8239871456116
12083. it was meant to insult him and didn't quite	succeed	373.7163466549149
12084. he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly	and it was his turn to smile now	2816.549284260601
12085. i don't mind washing dishes now	and then he said pleasantly	504.8481387013063
12086. it might hurt	you though	22.479509383398305
12087. somebody might mistake you for a woman	94.58044682641227
12088. he meant to say more but he never got the chance	755.6437363378465
12089. she brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried	to step back	1253.422759750768
12090. she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her	wrist and pulled her out of the saddle	2569.584538096621
12091. she came down against	him and he tried to break her fall	638.2376533195809
12092. he grabbed her by the shoulders	and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind	was driven out of him	4096.512433501557
12093. it made him a little sick and he let go of	her	642.9575566571826
12094. he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood	facing her	1876.9414002831593
12095. he wiped the blood from his cheek	93.49410653322573
12096. i ought to-	he said	22.189643826883902
12097. he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long	painful gasps	637.4366447297272
12098. that quirt- i ought to use it on you where it would	do the most good	1889.0162791807015
12099. if you were a man-   she isn't	mister	167.69987820059367
12100. the voice came from behind him and wilson turned	393.7387005501642
12101. the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the	trees	1104.3030900264844
12102. but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light	and wilson had a good look at him	2838.4092488191686
12103. he was tall and dark-skinned a	half-breed wilson thought	260.9151027263255
12104. and he was handsome despite the long thin	scar that slanted across his cheek	1399.9842871916824
12105. she's not a man	mister he said	93.39817564110362
12106. if you've got any ideas	22.20987403575524
12107. he raised	the winchester and pointed it at wilson's chest	372.6043740748765
12108. put	the rifle down joseph the girl said	251.68959573199476
12109. i	thought i told you to stay home	166.86799716825269
12110. the half-breed eased the	winchester down and rested it across his lap	958.1735320957547
12111. the scar looked pure	white in the half-darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless	1257.8805180210145
12112. you shouldn't be riding up here after dark judith	he said quietly	961.814001311384
12113. i can take care of this	43.28871600031856
12114. it's no job for	you	22.323821799865243
12115. the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee	and glared at him	791.4412612984364
12116. he took it without flinching	22.188191872620813
12117. i said	go home joseph	14.772759247164856
12118. you've got no business up here	65.42265461342848
12119. the half-breed	didn't answer this time	43.074317907004
12120. but the scar seemed to pull hard	at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry	2808.9160793428564
12121. he watched the half-breed as he turned silently	167.63568067066424
12122. they	could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the	sound faded out	2358.0335008060583
12123. wilson brushed the dust from his coat	94.43816330531337
12124. who	was that	0.30041514999999996
12125. he asked	0.20041515
12126. your personal guard	0.30041514999999996
12127. you're pretty	hard on him	14.897944004184541
12128. he works for my father the girl said	and then seemed to change her mind	1642.9100322285867
12129. his name's	joseph sanchez	2.9355882360568537
12130. is there anything else you want to know	250.0693683277562
12131. not now wilson said	2.9447784417316614
12132. i guess i'll find out soon	enough	138.39983953746653
12133. you've got blood on your cheek	43.262969312782374
12134. it must	have got there when you fell against me	559.6962868431085
12135. she wiped it off	with the sleeve of her coat	372.7107032826649
12136. i'll bet that's as close as	you've been to a man since you were a baby wilson said	2359.778964719074
12137. he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle	of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist	2181.729385586069
12138. oh no he said	and	he was without humor now	561.6112164600152
12139. i've had enough of that	14.672070310332856
12140. i've had enough	of you	22.27011707450017
12141. i don't know what goes on around here and i don't	care	642.6097798105272
12142. i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this	kind of business and i don't care about that either	3481.9730160306144
12143. you took me	by surprise	14.774361946701912
12144. but i'll know how to handle you next time	390.2850576621919
12145. she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker	1089.2293734832742
12146. he side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding	752.8532313049011
12147. she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle	503.7082054983054
12148. her	hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string	and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before	4643.51845443577
12149. he had forgotten that she was so pretty	166.79855773059964
12150. but her prettiness was what	he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward:	cruelty meanness self-will	2826.052293791344
12151. he had known women like that one woman	in particular	376.16584973650356
12152. and one had been too many	65.40521605844951
12153. he watched the girl until	she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the	sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were	sleeping	3548.889276915254
12154. they weren't sleeping of course but they thought	they were doing him a favor by pretending	1875.652983803006
12155. he hadn't shown up too	well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman	1254.457458934254
12156. they	expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances	and they were disappointed	1885.4690722810901
12157. and determined not to show it	43.39510803320081
12158. they	lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed	1181.8567588159365
12159. go to sleep he said	14.803317329407358
12160. there's better	things to do than listen to something like that	751.9080926472395
12161. i'll be down at	the creek finishing the dishes if you want me	790.8476833120751
12162. he found	the	pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream	2124.0541241111687
12163. the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would	be no other sounds to interrupt it	1872.9937247010942
12164. not tonight at any rate	22.044480247040035
12165. he had	a feeling that the girl meant trouble	262.34268416133466
12166. if she did he could stand	it better in the light	753.3552965544698
12167. he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans	and reflected on how things had turned out	942.9648992570015
12168. that afternoon when they	had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had	been high	2594.149515302749
12169. already some of the pain had gone from amelia's death	376.2170040802511
12170. there would still be plenty of moments of regret and	sadness and guilty relief	1415.2397787197674
12171. but they were starting a new life	93.91395982215478
12172. and they	had almost everything they needed: land a house two whiteface	bulls three horses	1651.1299804563707
12173. the land wasn't all wilson had expected	of it	259.9260561511236
12174. six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis	had said; good grass good water	2354.855671280526
12175. well the grass was there though	in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it	2023.6096837960297
12176. the	water was there so much of it that it spread all through	the dead orchard	1869.2533815758325
12177. and there was a house; livable perhaps but	badly in need of repairs	786.2873351932686
12178. in the last analysis though wilson	had little cause to complain	751.6824375779919
12179. the place had been cheap- just the	little he had left after amelia's burial- and it would serve its	purpose	1883.4496042866322
12180. there was only one place where jake carwood's description	had gone badly awry: the peace and quiet	2139.631410071188
12181. it hadn't started out	that way	42.98289769238595
12182. and he had a feeling- thanks to the girl- that things	would get worse before they got better	2367.568359629316
12183. they had the house cleaned	up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring	in the horses	2170.914613635216
12184. he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with	the heavy harness and finally went over to help him	2839.351086502837
12185. kathy was already	in the wagon	43.492465613825374
12186. they were going to town and they were both excited	557.7875502086468
12187. wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they weren't	going to town at all	1253.5553856141346
12188. he had an uneasy feeling about it	141.33118953084758
12189. that girl	last night what was her name	166.90273466706668
12190. judith pierce	0.30041514999999996
12191. it was the only	thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember	1093.4891455920622
12192. he finished	with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him	1420.5099443980878
12193. he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in	broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made	it seem	2867.593704273963
12194. there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow	under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze	3474.4985539500326
12195. there was an artificial lake just out of sight in	the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out	of the ground above the hillside orchard	3330.6972097989005
12196. yes there was plenty of water	too much and that was probably the trouble	1407.0163739561074
12197. there were tracks	of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres	783.2925639943098
12198. the first	part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and	curled gradually into the valley	3271.9607581588457
12199. it was hotter once they reached	the flat and drier but the grass was better	1092.8901893353748
12200. a warm breeze played across	it moving it like waves	557.8433480369597
12201. a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them	and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might	stir up from the side of the road	2846.6497076942546
12202. it took them an hour before they came	to the first houses of kelseyville	1414.72160165167
12203. the town was about what	wilson expected: one main street with its rows of false-fronted	buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel; all dusty	and sunbaked	3105.6323009550065
12204. such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility	of	this; under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all	4078.873708036731
12205. i was nearly thirty at the time	93.76141516152909
12206. i went to the hall in the	afternoons only on these preliminary matters	1194.2984392537564
12207. it was dark and i sensed	very large; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long	fluorescent tube suspended directly above it	2586.9103403359486
12208. sometimes i was aware	of people moving about in the darkness	754.1899325360529
12209. i would turn away from my	writing	in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded	2173.2466605768627
12210. a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most	747.9792996012101
12211. squatting as if waiting	2.9431563073300806
12212. the pulsing glow of	a cigarette	65.18996508279426
12213. since they could see me but i not them their presence	in the hall disturbed me	1252.6971292376845
12214. the clerk paid them no attention	64.95756276286141
12215. this impressed	me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence	787.7131735514412
12216. his job simply consisted in registering new men	248.89720137509343
12217. when the phone rang	he answered it	93.485112101944
12218. his authority extended to the far edge of the counter	no further	962.8493470579758
12219. none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak	to him	791.9784513101023
12220. baldness was attacking his pate	22.088422928200227
12221. he spoke to me in a gruff	voice an affectation which quite belied his personality	1095.5664289746933
12222. he wore	his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest	underneath	2127.6751727152086
12223. it was obvious that he wished himself different from the	sort of person he thought he was	1413.2892333865661
12224. but it was not easy for him and he	often slipped	754.807404688446
12225. when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the	floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the	clerk winced	3101.2298907540235
12226. i felt certain he was really a spineless little man	561.2002876936543
12227. his hat hung on a hook on the wall and	underneath it i could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over	his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to	have left his neck	4137.58996536515
12228. the morning's tabloids were on the counter and	a stack of dog-eared men's magazines	1407.4121483982112
12229. on a shelf in the office behind	the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which	broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music	2867.588893624239
12230. everything	about the clerk was trivial	64.76415693953626
12231. once pressing him i learned that his	job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the	hall	2034.044940207835
12232. noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps	and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person	3251.524210248099
12233. with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air	262.50408074455515
12234. when he saw me coming	he turned his radio off	565.358218120163
12235. he made a show of rearranging my forms on	the shelf	500.8404934645431
12236. he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence	then bark into it with gruff importance	2118.309873827939
12237. what limited knowledge he	possessed he forced upon me	260.2617159156641
12238. in the mornings i was informed fluorescent	tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire	hall	2588.4882514119686
12239. they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as	daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall	could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office	3961.4961614346503
12240. he	pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed	that he would let deed follow words	3043.656793783445
12241. i was shown instead a batch of	white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning	1733.148662927309
12242. now	here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached	for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand	3452.204022080606
12243. he couldn't afford	to have anyone mess around with them he said	639.5588247347769
12244. each of those tickets	was of great value to its rightful recipient	961.0597016225714
12245. later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about	the worth of a ticket	1566.50636360858
12246. having nothing else to do except wait	for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning	the hall itself	3486.096394649655
12247. when suitably lighted what would it look like	167.7000955608213
12248. the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the	hall could become crowded for air	2358.3345620510054
12249. one afternoon upon receiving permission	and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited	the toilet adjoining the hall	1891.8488010595338
12250. by counting the number of stalls and	urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall	would hold at one time	4099.991072848508
12251. for although i had crossed a corner of the	hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far	to the rear the darkness extended	3324.64000120563
12252. i could observe the two fans down	at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long	as i had no measure of comparison	4478.771125630989
12253. i had for some time been hoping	in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and	myself	2323.1940075202606
12254. i knew that three or four of them were almost always present	in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not	tell	4259.57995502415
12255. it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no	tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in	the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light	3943.7918409529098
12256. this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes	were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through	the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or	squatting on the floor below	6798.99352012298
12257. also the clerk appeared to disapprove	of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder	1099.0767388841964
12258. no sooner would	i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at	times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention	4270.544324931494
12259. and i had	hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion	when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from	the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently	3881.504624003498
12260. this sort	of petty vigilance annoyed me	139.64303611121605
12261. i felt certain it was self-appointed	43.03831809952457
12262. it sprang from a type of mentality i'd encountered often enough but	certainly had not expected to find here	2576.3809169794595
12263. i decided to see no more of	the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed	1413.2299702473856
12264. i	felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when	i did not go to look at it from a distance	3895.3915252066217
12265. i lived in a state of	suspense because of it	373.5447875623969
12266. i could not cling to my past nor did i wish	to	954.299535314173
12267. i had signed it off on the forms	166.85293126511718
12268. my future lay solely with the	hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point	2354.883330332862
12269. although	i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning	786.0911338569764
12270. i wished to	prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to	be wearing	2590.389507383989
12271. i did not despair however; far from it! i was constantly	searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall	1868.0776333633573
12272. though	only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town	its character was wholly foreign to me	3032.262359806935
12273. large warehouses flanked the	street on which the hall fronted	378.25421983122305
12274. the river was only a few blocks away	but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it	2576.300921972318
12275. sometimes	i noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the	pier roofs	1101.33810273086
12276. the sounds issuing from beyond- winches whirring men	shouting- indicated great activity and excited me	1646.3500790068633
12277. the hall on the	other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront	afternoons	1101.7126304188778
12278. it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before	139.6896395440328
12279. its front	was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication	that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street	2470.7453646576946
12280. i	kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the	rear of the hall	2373.8152792682413
12281. but it was not a tall structure and other buildings	concealed it	641.3966486849315
12282. for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses	and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps	and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did i cease to feel	myself a stranger there	5497.600325748386
12283. i returned to the hall despite my dislike	for the clerk	503.3298202123354
12284. as i had expected he insisted that my visits	to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application	3273.993311516172
12285. meanwhile spring had passed well into summer	93.51856552570541
12286. at last when i put	it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my	case was unusual	3463.189127445603
12287. when i asked him what if anything i could do about	it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall	2454.8155820932816
12288. i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before	ten o'clock	1406.2873005712495
12289. the clerk impressed this upon me: that i should	not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock	1410.3045357780716
12290. when i went for my interview	with the director i saw why	960.2348417694687
12291. although it was dark as usual i	could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people	1901.4285251341116
12292. cigarette butts littered the floor	22.388770537139024
12293. the big fans were going drawing	from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about	in pale strata underneath the ceiling	2461.698535593515
12294. i had felt the draft they were	making while mounting the stairs	957.0653002051631
12295. the staircase itself seemed still	to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men	934.7871161477108
12296. i stopped by the counter	22.28742630875576
12297. no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed	for the first time a door which had been left partially open	2859.7403794335105
12298. past it i could see part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on	the floor	2607.854666567415
12299. i rapped my knuckles on the counter	93.86780615455771
12300. the director came to the door	64.95781395011895
12301. i was at once disappointed although	just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained	1896.1056231926402
12302. he was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium	height; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk	tie and green-tinted soft collar	4655.198231182952
12303. he wore perforated white-topped	shoes;	they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance	routine any moment	2028.6114538429597
12304. but he came toward me sedately enough showed	me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked	to a file cabinet and got out my application	4832.381506619138
12305. i had the impression	that he had read my forms perhaps several times	782.0587816279158
12306. he did not look	at them now	140.57934683646533
12307. as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered	what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to	do with the workings of the hall	3107.03427729638
12308. he spoke in a voice as immaculate	as his appearance	565.6417738192641
12309. why had i registered	2.9700251533838125
12310. begging my pardon he	must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying	at the hall	2586.286811378266
12311. he had looked over my forms and was impressed by	what he had seen there; indeed my scholastic qualifications were such	that he a college graduate himself must envy me them	3325.9867904786342
12312. was i sure	he asked that i knew what i was applying for	1172.8898213318214
12313. what sort of men	i would come into contact with at the hall	793.9761860139424
12314. these questions did	not surprise	me; i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk	seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle	a dark and unwelcome place	5470.923760056617
12315. though i doubted that he would understand	me i told the director my motives for applying	1256.1900766442288
12316. i had always i	said hankered after working hard with my hands	954.3418474358847
12317. this desire i went	on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such	a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only	to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing	3953.986823698032
12318. to this effect i	had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence	1865.5176195708798
12319. the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head	1254.2415048297435
12320. hell with it	0.30041514999999996
12321. before	they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the	guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard	1885.1198279601279
12322. the man went over	without sound falling to the bare floor	754.785266383745
12323. barton said harshly	why did you do that	166.89333186796443
12324. rankin sneered at him	4.442869439192954
12325. what	did you want me to do kiss him	261.3226107038762
12326. he dumped me in solitary twice	64.85369296076671
12327. barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him	around	377.3158102445559
12328. let's get one thing straight you and me	252.03457327497546
12329. the	only reason we brought you was to get miller out	499.9391262206526
12330. if you ever try anything	without my orders i'll kill you	753.2211466913482
12331. fred rankin looked	at him	14.847943388935676
12332. it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the	thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now	3492.7805565283793
12333. they filed out through the	guard-room door into the paved square	502.89770326296684
12334. there were three other men within	this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they	were in other cell blocks	3249.819884094401
12335. they moved slowly toward	the main gate following the wall	377.4048853740351
12336. they had	chosen this night purposely	65.28942350004272
12337. they reached the guard house without alerting	the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door	1723.7262657477343
12338. two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed	391.82869454008784
12339. they	looked up in surprise as powers came in	261.4347011588504
12340. what are you doing	out of the block	250.59920331893272
12341. it's curtiss he said naming	the man rankin had hit	375.2142005341021
12342. i've got to have help	22.203600961644675
12343. the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet	166.46184867995504
12344. what's wrong with him	4.442869439192954
12345. he's having some kind	of a fit	93.96961505929889
12346. the sergeant turned to the door	64.95781395011895
12347. as he passed through	it barton shoved his gun against the man's side	788.6267477943279
12348. one	sound and you're dead	22.225210616388345
12349. powers had	not followed	2.9470431388369946
12350. powers was covering the remaining guard	65.8682744679994
12351. the man half-reached	for the cord of the alarm bell	374.30265478758946
12352. powers knocked his arm aside	22.33189767067766
12353. deliberately with none of rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel	of his gun alongside the guard's head	1415.3498385731364
12354. even barton could not quite believe it	140.32472521638564
12355. it had gone without a hitch	43.49642768671681
12356. they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark	ground	1415.3015502126868
12357. five minutes later they reached the horses	93.55945976945276
12358. barton was relieved	to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts	1655.6608546017687
12359. he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the	escape party they would be short	1561.7271917868925
12360. they walked	the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in	the lead seven men riding quietly through the night	3284.339721643713
12361. the only	thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform	of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts	2310.134565184907
12362. in a small grove against the river they halted turning	deep into the protection of the trees	2108.6370439961793
12363. foster had brought extra clothing	also	43.611710146199684
12364. he had been one of the original night	riders one who had escaped the trial	1659.1158899532784
12365. it was to him that barton	had sent carl dill on dill's release from the prison	1259.0664719226745
12366. clyde	miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit	and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt	3277.068132327776
12367. kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart	501.0339875649271
12368. barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers	558.8551015131775
12369. i won't even try to thank you	93.60266304853675
12370. the ex-prison guard	was embarrassed	22.13606009034973
12371. he said in a studied voice i didn't do it for	you	645.2425822054732
12372. i did it for the valley	65.14831269865233
12373. you're the only man the night riders	will follow	262.49117868374526
12374. we've been starving and i don't like to starve	392.1607966833391
12375. barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside	his horse	501.43293358742113
12376. the murderer lifted his head	22.270876737981283
12377. meaning you want me to ride out	92.44282641271045
12378. you aren't	one of us	22.055651558826185
12379. there's nothing for you here	14.951003568877033
12380. i got no place	to go	65.65768743863968
12381. he did not trust rankin his	violent temper his killer instinct	500.15316859133253
12382. but ten years in prison had taught	him realities	391.66257253529943
12383. they were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and	money	504.05115928960095
12384. it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to	call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination	the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure	5906.113757409139
12385. but	if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who	knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the	other side	3090.9822978224174
12386. your choice he said briefly and turned to	kid boyd	565.6179689480562
12387. bury those uniforms so they won't be found	166.7739085131549
12388. then barton touched carl dill's arm and moved off up the river	bank	1188.5521004138488
12389. he wanted a careful uninterrupted report from dill on the	conditions in the valley	945.3772430637804
12390. they squatted on their heels in the	deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over	silently	3267.4027861181357
12391. he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months	without the solace of tobacco	1248.4692343489364
12392. mitchell barton drew in the fragrance	deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat	for a moment before he exhaled	3477.8590768060676
12393. through the gloom he could not	see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly	1417.804004353559
12394. for his	first five years in prison they had shared a cell	957.69633724096
12395. carl dill	was neither a rancher nor a valley man	376.4251063170914
12396. he had been the auditor for	the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the	syndicate's money	2837.6220284927135
12397. he had done time for the theft	93.45279877589557
12398. the one	thing they had in common was their hatred	558.6776783536774
12399. it had drawn them together and since his release from prison dill	had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape	1864.1906656002666
12400. he	said	now i've got the perfect headquarters set up	563.4105108645805
12401. mitch barton knew the place	14.944525503043977
12402. twenty years before	a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky	hills south of grass valley	3046.717373738761
12403. they had spent a million dollars carving	in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel	1415.911089379501
12404. then	the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned	1192.9046276811273
12405. the road's washed badly said dill but there's a	trail you can get over with a horse	1419.7644868859384
12406. a company of cavalry couldn't	come in there if two men were guarding that trail	1638.627851565865
12407. how do the valley people feel	43.46385579777455
12408. as mad as ever	4.397995896309053
12409. but kruger's men keep them off balance and they don't trust	me	638.7478514788455
12410. when they learn you're in the hills though	they'll rally don't worry about that	1415.7048352321676
12411. barton waited	for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost	in his mind	1410.292203306773
12412. did you find him	4.442869439192954
12413. dill	was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling	of apprehension	1580.0147232538325
12414. barton half-straightened in surprise	4.423378319224009
12415. what's he doing	there	2.934716535754658
12416. again dill hesitated	0.30041514999999996
12417. dealing faro	0.20041515
12418. how come	0.30041514999999996
12419. your sister-in-law has	the faro bank in cap ayres' saloon	374.8471438051544
12420. barton cursed under	his breath	22.202952120992126
12421. after another long pause he asked how many people	know who they are	783.7405395509489
12422. everyone	0.30041514999999996
12423. your cousin finley saw	to that	43.18273372590569
12424. he's quite a rat you know	65.74091950978948
12425. he sold out to kruger's men	43.390097968782975
12426. he's informed them of everything you've ever written him	390.12994031513057
12427. barton stood up	0.20041515
12428. he said tensely all	right	22.18372370888455
12429. let's go get the boy	14.875801865561538
12430. dill had come up also	22.275605026375125
12431. i	was afraid of this	14.706553643040426
12432. i almost didn't tell you	22.27907686250887
12433. if	you hadn't i'd have killed you	93.53260038314446
12434. but you can't ride into the ferry	141.20948075250922
12435. that's what they'll	expect you to do	94.52901133566795
12436. they'll be there waiting for you	65.32592268408345
12437. i understand	how you feel about the child h	264.6272197293184
12438. barton's	voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it	556.3202903554164
12439. my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away	374.24956489448437
12440. i	can't leave him there	22.200490206878502
12441. donald kruger would like nothing better	than to hold him as hostage and i wouldn't entrust a snake to his	tender care	2192.1760910040935
12442. i've got to get the boy	65.14673215541924
12443. two	barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen	places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult	2031.2241416934007
12444. it	was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the	news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state	4084.361709593811
12445. it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame	373.5086094688734
12446. it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield	558.6438042788855
12447. it	brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences	640.434299018247
12448. for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and	mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence	3694.7913965772414
12449. creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit	373.65559298675396
12450. the	office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove	1178.8785758127065
12451. the	building was dwarfed by the scene outside	166.44458749019074
12452. there a dozen giant monitors	played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam	of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside	3252.019370367434
12453. the gravel was	the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of	earth	1255.4760556804126
12454. it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled	before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand	fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices	5926.880571197288
12455. a million dollars' of gold a month	93.72136387602555
12456. a million tons of rock	and soil and brush	392.41211931929354
12457. the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day	93.9259015665481
12458. their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could	be heard for miles	1646.5569108766674
12459. hague like all who worked near the pits was partly	deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums	1570.2949093708512
12460. he	was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill	air	1653.4218116137258
12461. fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt	166.91605766296902
12462. ten years older	than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits	to manager of the operation	3271.7904766562015
12463. he was proud of his accomplishments	proud of his job proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted	him	1722.8880283848023
12464. he lived and breathed for the mining company	250.66360421029603
12465. no	man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and	hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life	2584.103855529548
12466. there	came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke	in the entrance from the outer room	3513.0605256878175
12467. hague had never accustomed	himself to kodyke	93.9372761397768
12468. the man was tall thin with a narrow face and	a too-large nose	1184.2651174875468
12469. the eyes always held hague eyes of a dead man lidless	as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra	2041.5636644049441
12470. even hague	was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke	752.269226377952
12471. he knew nothing about the man's history	94.43219399340823
12472. kodyke had appeared at the	mine one day bearing a letter from kruger	1192.8403106982291
12473. kodyke was to head the	dread company police	169.12054045581127
12474. he ran the change rooms	22.16001114683207
12475. he threw out the hi-graders	14.87679807089231
12476. he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw	gold which each week went out to san francisco	2567.4303156572705
12477. hague squeezed	down his uneasy dislike	43.57904556692374
12478. he pulled open the top drawer of his desk	and drew out a tintype	1404.8425777062216
12479. he broke	out of folsom last night	93.7836805557065
12480. apparently he bribed one of the guards	140.65404520805131
12481. we want him back there or we want him dead	374.5731739902696
12482. kodyke took the	picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully	747.9758774545992
12483. you know how the ranchers in the	valley are	262.1806683716933
12484. they blame us for all their troubles	139.96953421938468
12485. ten years ago they	blew up some of our ditches	372.10441936768945
12486. it cost us a hundred thousand dollars	and thirty days lost time to fix them	1636.8277214624618
12487. we don't want barton's night	riders loose again	167.55140456264786
12488. the gunman nodded slipping the picture	into his breast pocket saying nothing	962.8464117463124
12489. normally hague	wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although	he knew kodyke was aware of all he said	2591.8316347235186
12490. if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she	did not comment upon it	2335.36438619775
12491. after they had finished eating melissa	took sprite the kitten under her arm- so that auntie grace	can teach it about the whistle- and climbed into the station wagon	beside her mother	3465.511967229189
12492. she had offered to walk but pamela knew she	would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided	her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called	auntie	5762.065564450042
12493. when they reached their neighbor's house pamela	said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on	the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought- of the type	to which she was frequently subject these days- that they might never	see one another again	4759.62149036672
12494. then she turned the station wagon around and	headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination	3056.098485666698
12495. as she drove she thought about her plan	167.21624268489023
12496. it was really	quite simple	22.259963351326324
12497. so simple in fact that it might even work- although	pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend	too much assurance	2715.891322454298
12498. that mistake she thought had cost her dearly	these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of	the traps that the mountain might set for her	4989.510618329032
12499. she must be cautious	so as not to alert the scheming forest	641.8946482427514
12500. when the station wagon	drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver	house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar	parking spot close to the house and stopped	6196.4813610908395
12501. all of her movements	were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who	has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which	step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime	4371.6704149721845
12502. she locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and	went into the house	2124.508588466263
12503. here she dropped the keys on a small table beside	the door and went upstairs to her bedroom	1571.08355249415
12504. on her bureau lay	a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving- an	object which pamela believed now had been the property of her	great-grandfather	major hiram munroe culver	5015.605438625007
12505. he had belonged to this	land and perhaps had desecrated it- and this was the only material	symbol that remained of him	2171.587598674834
12506. if she pamela were being held responsible	for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation	2580.7684017308297
12507. she	would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into	the soil every spring h or as ancient fertility cults demand annual	human sacrifice	3006.4644717348397
12508. slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the	ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out	of the house	3267.989514857599
12509. there was only one place where the mountain might receive	her- that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom	1884.487031241061
12510. atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred	sacrificial basin	1412.0633627190984
12511. it was there that she would have to enact her	renunciation beg forgiveness	786.1563847033037
12512. perhaps it was insane pamela	thought	64.59587824336106
12513. perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream	167.0769836356287
12514. but she was	caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were	a dream it was one from which she might never awaken	4279.815886309942
12515. facing	the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between	two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction	of the pool	3323.534986164867
12516. she remembered little of her previous journey there with	grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission	would enable her to accomplish it	4252.597581253081
12517. the forest was open and freely	welcoming extending an enchanted hand	502.91723631425003
12518. the ground was covered with	soft pine needles and the slope was gentle	1182.8454346308772
12519. birds chirped and chattered	in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders	warmly from time to time	2173.283619861385
12520. it was not thought pamela such	an evil place after all	749.9496474724014
12521. no wonder melissa responded so completely to	its beckoning	262.69299778979774
12522. perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees	that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed	2578.9507322156264
12523. was it not	possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her	child h that its sympathy lay with the culvers h that she had erred	in failing to understand this	3746.916547301549
12524. pamela felt calm and peaceful	as she walked along	397.38873642148064
12525. the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion	of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the	dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken	her fear	3835.679241711355
12526. she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the	glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive	in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its	darkling inhabitants	5757.105131261547
12527. having persisted too long in deliberate	ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved	now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward	grappling with them	3549.4898043677595
12528. a few days ago she would have thought such an	expedition as this utterly ridiculous; today on the contrary it	seemed utterly reasonable	3506.8872047843142
12529. she did not pause to consider what	she would do if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental	and physical energy toward achieving this one goal	3126.564634553829
12530. if as she walked	her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen	2124.1217766244044
12531. if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to	heed	1095.6229581755342
12532. success depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must be	poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that	she was in earnest	4094.1302140479966
12533. the forest took on an impersonal aspect	93.82299963882335
12534. it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its	bark or stripped the berries from its bushes	3263.3848149541072
12535. unconcerned indifferent	unmotivated the forest was simply there- fighting man's depredations	with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical	evening laughter	2463.6020179547127
12536. red man or white man pacifist or killer the	forest would accept them all- knowing that it could thrive equally	well on slaughter and beneficence; knowing that its ageless mass would	always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man	6535.658042848798
12537. she must not think about time	43.586972728252434
12538. that was another	one of those traps	140.8891303393622
12539. in her grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela	focused her thoughts on her husband	784.7498574605235
12540. if when this was all over she	found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever	understand	3276.812304904196
12541. how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent	498.60654302454316
12542. indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his	days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her	benighted ancestor	3453.701556757068
12543. his bright daylight mind would whistle away such	images; they would not dare to face his scoffing	1417.7214930508142
12544. pamela was	glad jim was nowhere near	140.2545099820035
12545. his presence would have interfered with	her duty	166.16557723146525
12546. the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once	or twice on the smooth pine needles	1644.9129913775419
12547. the trees huddled more closely together	their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against	the sun	1580.530360814009
12548. bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours	for the	struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to	act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction	5627.06318470265
12549. nevertheless she continued to move upward	43.284541392968315
12550. she was sure she	would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite	the increasing number of obstacles	3270.2686446184503
12551. the forest had become an alien	world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever	hindrances were offered	1886.581871827368
12552. it was a bold dark castle of pine boughs	that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human	time	3036.2205017212527
12553. at one and the same time she was within it but still searching	for the drawbridge that would give her entry	2017.2321955246534
12554. silence came into	the forest- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring	mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees	4095.565398336594
12555. silence	walked at pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far	for her to hear	1252.1195018182912
12556. silence stood in front of her waiting and in back	of her blocking her retreat	1629.8967247530227
12557. she stumbled over the root of a	tree that protruded maliciously above the earth	945.1153909574932
12558. in spite of her attempt	to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone	2341.4958536767313
12559. for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath	returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet	laboriously	2586.515660575434
12560. she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her	clothes	1177.7022303132976
12561. her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in	pain	641.6885433455316
12562. she was bewildered	0.30041514999999996
12563. she seemed to	have come such a long distance- too far for her destination which had	wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees	2852.4333767110174
12564. she stood	quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a	path to follow a clue to guide her	3455.528399888499
12565. she was standing in a thick	grove	93.51339543179343
12566. the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches	overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely	2116.8228843987695
12567. the earth	smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing	effect of the sun's rays	2025.2229169580355
12568. she had the feeling that under the mouldering	leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying	and giving their soil back to the mountain	4290.178275609782
12569. the thought	made pamela shudder	14.740206244127046
12570. a terrible chill swept through the grove	140.21736552380293
12571. not	a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome	familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching pamela	in a leering embrace	3117.9945606680258
12572. there was a peculiar density about it a thick	substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived	2813.1202391327797
12573. where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such	a scene	644.4646527014023
12574. she already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that	was somehow grotesquely alive	960.4911878917859
12575. it enclosed her clammy hands and twined	around her ankles	373.5861261477944
12576. it crept into the open neck of her blouse and	slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores	of her skin	4070.015172393991
12577. it crawled across her breasts suffocating the life	in her nipples	502.275258551071
12578. it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles	392.1549570242151
12579. it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and	its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into	steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached; stifled	her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps; clutched her	throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was	dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched	together in the rigid fixture of her jaws	0.20124717349522497
12580. she had to	get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid	of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her	of reason and sight	5148.91685844153
12581. but she did not know which way to go	261.34747600001293
12582. the shadows	of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the	grove	1418.5135304834653
12583. she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around	her throat in ever-tightening circles	1408.2567458911503
12584. she could not scream	for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who	would hear who would listen	3278.900080735897
12585. does the mountain listen	2.956715193383543
12586. pamela groped blindly	0.30041514999999996
12587. she had to move in	some direction- any direction that would take her away from this evil	place	1560.279168977087
12588. she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees	that resisted her and tried to fling her back	2356.413933526537
12589. her own body protested	aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold	demon wisps still clung and caressed	2176.2676819929884
12590. every movement she made	seemed unnecessarily noisy	140.9093882882442
12591. twigs cracked loudly under her feet;	bushes swished and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped	as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her	2453.0112743357067
12592. miraculously she found exactly the right statement	140.9364001727587
12593. she began	it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him	1092.6979016286136
12594. i want to tell you something thomas demontez lord	394.8132249012703
12595. i'm	well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg and that i	don't amount to anything	1883.3434685511852
12596. but-   but it don't matter	a-tall lord supplied fondly	395.7365474258298
12597. to me you'll always be the	girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows	1256.3473485955603
12598. beaming	idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her	958.1489065043394
12599. she yanked away from him furiously	43.68496067802981
12600. you shut up! shu-tt	up-pp! i've got something to say to you and by god you're	going to listen	2589.5995668866412
12601. do you hear me	2.9297641017805476
12602. you're going to listen!	lord nodded agreeably	141.36451293878048
12603. he said he wanted very much to listen	166.60282160858472
12604. he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would	be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he didn't	want to miss a word of it	5478.077120674194
12605. so would she mind speaking a little louder	167.61913695233986
12606. i think you stink tom lord! i think you're mean	and hateful and stupid and- louder	1889.4179563081543
12607. said joyce	0.20041515
12608. so i can hear you while i'm checkin' the car	562.0495462346281
12609. looks	like we might be in for a speck of trouble	498.5922853035947
12610. he opened the	door and got out	140.08798898723705
12611. he waited at the car side for a moment looking down	at her expectantly	941.9317232400406
12612. well	0.30041514999999996
12613. wasn't you goin' to say	somethin'	43.488353813217486
12614. then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary	silence maybe you could write it down for me huh	2821.5354793563115
12615. print it	in real big letters an' i can cipher it out later	787.7879202147492
12616. aah	go on she said	22.19027999887045
12617. just go the hell on	14.91014269621169
12618. he grinned	nodded and walked around to the front of the car	969.0132210806523
12619. lips pursed mournfully	he stared down at its crazily sagging left side	641.5641485811824
12620. then he hunkered	down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly	chaos of axle shock absorber and spring	3276.2122752437876
12621. he went prone on	his stomach the better to pursue his examination	641.7608176959109
12622. after a time he straightened	again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping	it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar	shirt	3904.3592905144556
12623. he wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer	in this country	943.2052738119031
12624. never he'd once told joyce had he encountered	any man or situation that called for a gun	2106.5621236152506
12625. and he really feels	that way she thought	165.85624891104874
12626. that's really all he's got all he is	251.09520315475748
12627. just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package	499.48565328312117
12628. if	i could make myself feel the same way h   she studied him	hopefully yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland	it was easy to confirm her analysis	4836.682587484998
12629. here in the god-forsaken	place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant	almost contemptible	1414.1115075581351
12630. he was handsome with his coal-black	hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features	963.3474130227694
12631. but she'd known	plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there	left	1252.3527795338716
12632. he wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side	561.5637933853113
12633. neither	was he very powerful of build	93.57095875308022
12634. he could move very quickly she knew	but he was more wiry than	truly strong	1646.277069912372
12635. and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an	almost delicate appearance	788.8354013030826
12636. just nothing she told herself	21.975770152234272
12637. just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on	everyone	932.211039939755
12638. but by gosh i want him and i'm going to have him!	he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer's	teetering half-mincing walk	4308.327188729354
12639. why did these yokels still wear	boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years	1420.6069749435278
12640. he	slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered	one to her	2351.747597770369
12641. oh cut it out tom! she snapped	93.38102714467358
12642. can't	you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute	563.6284359052958
12643. this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested	93.81919935577328
12644. or maybe	you just don't feel like a cigar	395.3739333930054
12645. i feel like getting	back to town that's what i feel like! now are you going to take	me or am i supposed to walk	2592.456492915261
12646. might get there faster	walkin' lord drawled seein' as how i got a busted front	spring	1898.5494051613732
12647. on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either	263.32657846345774
12648. i figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and i c'n maybe	get this spring patched up in a couple of hours	3037.2276164889527
12649. how-	with what	0.20041515
12650. there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes	65.30981271274057
12651. now ain't it the truth	14.940720907340964
12652. lord laughed with secret amusement	22.173952427374914
12653. not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon i'll get	the boss rattler to help me	1414.183280032869
12654. tom! for god's sake!	looky	22.179143232684005
12655. he pointed cutting her off	14.814749558374809
12656. see	that wildcat	0.30041514999999996
12657. she saw it then the distant derrick of the	wildcat- a test well in unexplored country	1258.2736909528587
12658. and even with her limited	knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired	there; sufficiently at least to get them back into town	4266.926630959866
12659. a wildcatter	had to be prepared for almost any emergency	369.81475446534404
12660. he had to depend on	himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others	1892.4638703369014
12661. well let's get going she said impatiently	93.30960475904199
12662. i-	she broke off frowning	22.20834483702381
12663. what did you mean by that rattlesnake	gag	166.51075567618892
12664. getting the boss rattlesnake to help you	140.73833877241572
12665. why	i meant what i said lord declared	165.9586106488889
12666. what else would i mean	anyways	65.52976361057324
12667. she looked at him lips compressed	43.563006057880145
12668. then with	a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse	and went through the motions of fixing her make-up	3464.7133896842774
12669. in his mood it	was the best way to handle him; that is to show no curiosity whatsoever	1574.272757340184
12670. otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked	until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle	in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood	5310.511604887966
12671. the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard	banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against	the road itself	2328.8790130002317
12672. lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering	wheel	395.1396457561905
12673. he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate	scheme was working out exactly as he had planned	1730.6777017205636
12674. along with this	self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension	555.6500109657503
12675. it poured	out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and	nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that	action would be all that he anticipated	3658.108304386634
12676. joyce had seen him like	this once before- more than once actually but on one particularly	memorable occasion	2363.1505201108166
12677. that was the day that he had practically mopped	up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride field boss	for the highlands oil + gas company	2050.857095367814
12678. tom had been laying	for aaron mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of	line	2582.483243281299
12679. mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with	a pistol on his hip	1414.1669639281397
12680. he had a legitimate reason for wearing it	249.87221515076098
12681. it	was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into	the oil fields	1581.4190057865
12682. moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly	the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it	2602.9933256004397
12683. so	what's this all about	14.844062574785625
12684. he demanded when lord confronted him	65.32097252114679
12685. i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without	a permit	1427.2244207919225
12686. it was the wrong thing to say	141.26655320044972
12687. by failing to do	as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to	his car- he had played into lord's hands	2866.8542746937733
12688. the trouble was	that he had virtually had to protest	560.9025229207673
12689. the deputy had forced him to	by his manner of accosting him	640.381514336828
12690. so how about it	4.39894529706599
12691. he	said	0.20041515
12692. why single me out on this permit deal	249.93368377838542
12693. well	i'll tell you about that lord told him	262.02016653680084
12694. we aim t' be see-lective	y'know	65.13677914682481
12695. don't like to bother no one unless we have	to which i figger we do in your case	1564.8733147600044
12696. figger we got to be plumb careful	with any of you highlands big shots	1413.8673815721074
12697. he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company	but that had nothing to do with him	1874.9675383106514
12698. he was an honest man doing a hard	job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable	2587.253977705438
12699. look lord he said hoarsely	14.775745701062286
12700. i know you've got	a grudge against me and maybe i can't blame you	1421.0538202288167
12701. you think that highlands	swindled you and i helped 'em do it	643.5110276752459
12702. but you're all wrong	man! i'm no lawyer	250.78564630376636
12703. i just do what i'm told and-	uh-huh	165.81994117345874
12704. an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's	workin' for crooks	969.4690799606949
12705. so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter	mcbride	499.07749781793547
12706. you do that or take you out a permit right now	757.0509998355041
12707. mcbride couldn't do either of course	43.40591445369061
12708. not immediately as the	deputy demanded	65.08165809722672
12709. not without a face-saving respite of at least a few	minutes	500.6332817690551
12710. to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible	391.56758410843906
12711. oil-field	workers were a rough-tough lot	43.563127663812466
12712. how could he exert authority over	them- make them toe the line as he had to- if he knuckled under to	this small-town clown	3704.90521539754
12713. i'll get around to it a little	later he mumbled desperately	498.67331967436775
12714. just as soon as i go to the bank	and-   huh-uh	761.0924641822193
12715. now mis-ter mcbride said	lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm	1422.1562183607525
12716. it was strictly the deputy's game but mcbride had gone	too far to throw in	1642.4820985536248
12717. now he could only play the last card in what was	probably the world's coldest deck	1254.7455180879474
12718. he flung off lord's	hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a	storefront	2136.111929535111
12719. it was practically the last move that mcbride made	of his own volition	785.5540059607756
12720. lord slugged him in the stomach so hard	that the organ almost pressed against his spine	1874.3730554638364
12721. then as he doubled	gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten lord straightened	him with an uppercut	1739.2370300477269
12722. a rabbit punch redoubled him	22.223129268426696
12723. and then	there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow	to the stomach h   but he couldn't keep up with them	2590.505208500375
12724. no	more could he defend himself against them	249.71440375417177
12725. he seemed to be fighting	not one man but a dozen	504.67928137041815
12726. and he could no longer think of face-saving	of honor but only of escape	1401.6957261604832
12727. why he's going to kill me	he thought wildly	261.15730266340955
12728. i meant him no harm	22.214613891984744
12729. i've given willful hurt	to no man	93.73356350205167
12730. i was just doing my job just following orders and for	that he's going to kill me	2120.83941054966
12731. beat me to death in front of a hundred	people	373.4184209911455
12732. somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was	about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for	it: the murder would go unpunished	4485.436018675068
12733. he mcbride would be cited	as in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who had	only done his duty though perhaps too energetically	2882.2548922702326
12734. mcbride	staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust	762.1588078895227
12735. fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled	to his feet again	787.181938549171
12736. he couldn't see; he was long past the point of	coherent thinking	961.902896830263
12737. dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but	he could not read the racket properly	1096.1758007879703
12738. he could not grasp that lord	had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were	flailing at nothing but the air	3886.574536587939
12739. he hated them too much to	understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that	was lord's world	1569.263076118098
12740. this he was sure was the way they would	act;	laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death	3477.1059364326525
12741. and	nothing would be done about it	94.04638357722234
12742. nothing unless h   donna!	donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife	to him	2356.5725370802998
12743. donna was like he was	14.801788089057132
12744. she lived by the rules never compromising	never blinded or diverted by circumstance	1187.0645828468537
12745. and donna would-	when he regained consciousness he was in lord's house in	the office of doctor lord the deputy's deceased father	2180.4783772172773
12746. the brannon outfit- known as the slash-b because of its brand-	reached hondo creek before sundown	1882.0509858776754
12747. the herd was watered and	then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's	bedground	1875.373299925101
12748. two of the new hands a mexican named jose amado and	a kid known only as laredo were picked for the first trick of riding	night herd	4300.244729293652
12749. the rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and	turned them into the remuda	945.5075220051901
12750. they got tin cups of coffee from the big	pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes	lounged about	3047.583965831457
12751. there was some idle talk a listless discussion of	this or that small happening during the day's drive	1567.7985887051318
12752. but they deliberately	avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure	of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit	3694.5892357490798
12753. it especially bothered	the older hands	43.61921172245671
12754. the cook mateo garcia had arrived	there long before the herd	749.9538320024374

12756. he was readying	a batch of sourdough biscuits for the dutch oven	968.6325877822837

12763. tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after	the maguires joined it which had been at midday	1729.6786671368034
12764. he'd come alone	without his wife and child	249.29550130771105
12765. he'd been in an angry mood: conchita	had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him	1574.876706430196
12766. she	wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife	1181.1920646331928
12767. she	wished that she could talk to her mother about it	501.3657700203561
12768. not that her mother	knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it	1400.24568528473
12769. but her	mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none	of her concern	1718.075754546148
12770. pat get out of that creek! you too sean!	elena you'll get mud all over your dress!   even	as she called to the children conchita let her gaze seek tom brannon	4991.493003054038
12771. tomas she called him- as the mexican hands did	262.34978394827

12773. whatever they are talking about	14.925995805206217
12774. conchita wondered	0.30041514999999996
12775. it	bothered her that she probably would never know	262.858192913578
12776. certainly she wouldn't	dare ask her father afterward	248.72202156858626
12777. he would tell her not to pry into	grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like elena!	at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything	3318.974798107415
12778. they were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still	empty calf wagon	1410.328343183848

12780. he held a cigarette	in his right hand	248.2952733215016
12781. it was burning away forgotten	14.872349338034493
12782. his face was	clouded with unhappiness	65.57061849813999
12783. he'd told hank maguire and luis	hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what	he now intended to do	2336.743025560354
12784. they were considering it gravely neither seeming	to like what he planned	957.8461659986226
12785. finally hernandez said i could	offer you advice tomas but you wouldn't heed it	944.5815665829108
12786. wait a little while	4.391442012661501
12787. let senora	brannon live in her father's house for a time	501.4937577332286
12788. give her time	to miss you	65.07725057707944
12789. maybe she will then come to you	94.07161949775922
12790. after all you want the	senora as much as you want the boy	1186.416111921732
12791. you need her even more than you	need him	264.34127459350617
12792. she won't change her mind brannon said	141.3579294948535
12793. john clayton will see to that	43.35152432125652
12794. but after a time	away from you h	252.82337936248095
12795. a year luis	0.20041515

12797. ten	0.20041515
12798. how	long should i wait	22.323969364683773
12799. maybe in a year tomas h	43.68208455003125
12800. in a year she'll like living in clayton's house too much to	come back to me brannon said flatly	2596.137802438424
12801. and the boy will be too	much under his influence by then	639.7677369634637
12802. i've got to take danny away from	clayton before i lose him altogether	1182.3706305596693
12803. hell in a year or five or ten	the boy will have forgotten me- his own father!   but	to take him and leave his mother behind is not good	3102.2415432193784
12804. in	my place you'd follow such advice as you give me	750.2672680196404
12805. hernandez	looked suddenly uncertain	2.959089095928957
12806. that i can't answer for i	can't imagine something like this happening to me	1403.1847041430694
12807. maybe i should	withdraw my advice- no	93.8152322520391
12808. brannon looked at hank maguire	22.347728857594788
12809. and you	0.20041515
12810. what would you do in my place	141.0640946567295
12811. hank	shook his head	2.9697231753747992
12812. like luis i can't see	something like this happening to me	749.3296638679828
12813. with maria and me there's never	any problem	165.4807362207558
12814. where i go she goes- and the kids with us	562.0796522656323
12815. you're	going	to need your woman	43.48006710352397
12816. and the boy will need his mother	140.78548744268375
12817. if you take	the one you'd better take both	262.86287729559024
12818. i won't force beth to come against her will	389.7228188858286
12819. but i'm going	to have my son	93.20796479616696
12820. they were silent for a little while each	looking glum	558.7942182810838
12821. finally luis hernandez said what must be	must be	259.08217128219286
12822. i am with you of course tomas	140.80753874775493
12823. and hank maguire	added so am i tom	166.76268035445995
12824. all right brannon said	rising	22.06650693236718
12825. we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck	263.76817305154947
12826. brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall	964.3395009243877
12827. they	had for cover both darkness and a summer storm	378.23763438001987
12828. during much of the	fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the	sky to the east	2843.1607238207953
12829. later they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then	just outside rockfork they ran into rain	1260.2169947100856
12830. those who had slickers	donned them	65.3237200980425
12831. the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever	they carried behind their saddle cantles	1263.4069735462383
12832. there were seven	of them enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff	1640.620512370385
12833. it was to	be nothing more than that	166.5532753976045
12834. there was to be no gunplay	65.54896609854863
12835. if the bluff	failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they	would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time	2743.4614191686683
12836. he didn't	want to put himself outside the law	391.6959463050396
12837. with him were hank	maguire luis hernandez and luis's son pedro	508.9416978102375
12838. the ramirez	brothers were also along	65.24601513841768
12839. the seventh man was red hogan a wiry little	puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising	1729.7075659696598
12840. they were	all good men	22.1875190733206
12841. it was dark early because of the storm	166.95804766627276
12842. also	because of the storm the streets of rockfork were deserted	751.0417573492439
12843. lighted	windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour	93.62745492316887
12844. they reined in	before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on main street	1419.8182252158626
12845. a lamp burned inside but brannon peering through the window	saw that the office was empty	1262.0958059271995
12846. he'd hoped to catch jesse macklin	there	141.38659537505305
12847. probably just stepped out he said	43.235240121132804
12848. red come along	0.30041514999999996
12849. the rest of you wait here	43.959823612556534
12850. with	red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe	392.7240557290323
12851. hogan got down from	the saddle and had a look inside	509.29341290098307
12852. not there he said getting back	onto his horse	392.0561615873943
12853. maybe he's at the hotel	14.925613682205102
12854. they rode	to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of	the street	1893.8637451051472
12855. they reined in there brannon remaining in the saddle while	hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room	2184.6617679011474
12856. he'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and	it was already soaked	1171.3709593216258
12857. but he felt no physical discomfort	43.67114710607696
12858. he was	only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain	392.7429821268473
12859. he hardly noticed the blue-green	flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder	945.1364135460628
12860. hogan	reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal	964.8534799848679
12861. brannon	dismounted and climbed the steps	43.97112035339953
12862. he's finished eating	hogan said	22.082251331584956
12863. sitting with a cup of coffee now	92.9800893016344
12864. it seemed long at least to tom brannon	250.43399938009662
12865. he	and hogan waited by the door one to either side	501.1957234560811
12866. macklin was the	third man to come out and he came unhurriedly	957.2482305309125
12867. he was puffing on a cigar	and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain	1407.860732481779
12868. it was	not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and	then it was too late	3032.665095543642
12869. they closed in fast kept him from reaching inside	his coat for his gun	944.6763090870651
12870. just come along brannon told	him	65.39642083503007
12871. don't start anything you can't finish	43.606244766327976
12872. we'll talk over at your office	65.30307147179226
12873. brannon i warn you! let's go marsh	al brannon said and took him by the arm	1261.820752801555
12874. hogan gripped the	lawman's other arm	65.12555016728756
12875. they escorted him down from the porch and through	the rain to his office	948.526641599394
12876. the other five slash-b men followed them	inside crowding the small room	959.1057242023656
12877. his face was stiff with anger when	they let go of his arms	786.6998129823662
12878. he looked at each of them in turn brannon	last of all	952.688987676036
12879. i'll remember you he said	14.803317329407358
12880. every	last one of you	22.27011707450017
12881. as for you brannon-   put your gun on	the desk marshal	503.7974438431289
12882. now hold on damn it; i won't-	red hogan's patience ran out	962.150592475016
12883. he lifted the skirt	of macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the	desk	1565.912434073175
12884. too much fooling around he said	65.29153743478857
12885. don't press your	luck badge-toter	14.91809451679931
12886. brannon said now the key to the lockup	marshal	392.7614295527268
12887. what for	0.20041515
12888. can't you guess	0.30041514999999996
12889. brannon said	0.20041515
12890. we're putting	you where you won't come to harm	393.2714239523481
12891. get it	out!   damned if i will	94.42515935997454
12892. brannon you've assaulted a	law officer and-   they moved in on him crowded him from	all sides	2125.1248157176674
12893. no man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was	there	937.1394757700045
12894. his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and	he seemed to have trouble with his breathing	2824.8274097481694
12895. he held out a moment	longer then his nerve gave under the pressure	788.4138304847218
12896. he swore and	said all right	64.97629320965459
12897. it's here in my pocket	14.850489308124017
12898. get it out	brannon ordered	22.27559303360497
12899. then as macklin obeyed: now let's	go out	back	261.95432091249324
12900. resignedly macklin turned to the back door	140.5889006614869
12901. they	followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty	feet to the rear	1570.178660397373
12902. the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded	with strap iron	1414.091942640394
12903. it was secured by an oversized padlock	94.64698477355554
12904. macklin	balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door	749.9664770769471
12905. they crowded	him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in	938.1990337571915
12906. once the	door was open they crowded him inside the dark building	959.3261439968294
12907. he was uttering	threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked	the door	1415.977093503786
12908. they returned to the street mounted their horses	rode through the rain to the big house on houston street	2610.0011465436774
12909. its windows	glowed with lamplight	14.808980835527066
12910. deputy marshal luke harper still stood	guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark	2368.1343181829807
12911. he came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand	on his gun	1570.78781408924
12912. don't try it brannon told him dismounting	and starting up the steps with his men following	1895.5908527467284
12913. don't get	yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you	373.3191803520363
12914. he strode past the now frightened man entered the house	562.4587983629414
12915. miguel and	arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering	786.6976315493738
12916. the others followed brannon inside	22.28375459345735
12917. they trailed him across	the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking	men who probably had never before ventured into such a house	2731.880430315476
12918. they brought	to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their	own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle	3885.0345197702723
12919. they tracked	mud on the oaken floor on the carpet	374.5383975562271
12920. their presence fouled the elegance	of that room	249.8494828959652
12921. and their arrival caught john clayton and	charles ansley off guard	506.6255828974319
12922. the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing	560.9600160375918
12923. for	men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had	received no second	1262.2070043521453
12924. but the day of the deadline came and passed and	the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction	3057.6499893829628
12925. for	with a single exception nothing had happened to them	373.4976530981231
12926. the	exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis	562.6463041941939
12927. after	walking out to his corral that morning he'd been amazed to see the	dust puff up in front of his feet	2172.942375180869
12928. a split second later the distant	crack of a rifle had sounded	966.4291863656803
12929. he'd mounted up immediately and raced	with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the	shot had come	2040.2280112704707
12930. but he had found all of the thickets and points of	cover deserted	1178.3040023926148
12931. there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or	trace to show that anyone had been near	1882.9067582108837
12932. lewis was a man who had	made a full-time job of cow stealing	1181.0062639456644
12933. he hadn't even pretended to	be farming his spread	259.5174918030763
12934. his land had never been plowed	64.75698844054169
12935. he had done	his rustling openly and boasted about it	375.58801305020086
12936. he had received both first	and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors	of writing them	2827.986558493195
12937. he had cursed at them and threatened them	166.47585842592065
12938. he was	a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend	in the world	1878.5303586239993
12939. william lewis made the rounds of all who lived	near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet	and once more he accused and threatened everyone	3217.8477057630726
12940. i'll	be ready next time! he raged	141.02347188237178
12941. i'll be shootin' right back	14.898658947621135
12942. he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the	same thing happened again	1644.4561906458653
12943. this time lewis had his own rifle in his	hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off	shot then spent most of the day searching out the area	3451.22272249483
12944. he found nothing	but he still refused to give up and move out	1174.9431381229033
12945. just	let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face!	he exploded	788.1216205589283
12946. that's all i ask!   he never got that	chance	390.6025900956047
12947. for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the	third time	643.901038018422
12948. 30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of william	lewis' chest	758.0542670966158
12949. he slumped against a log fence rail then tried	to lift himself	641.752631833228
12950. two more shots followed in quick succession dropping	him limp and huddled on the ground	1649.165376828839
12951. an inquest was held and	after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county	coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of	300 yards	3351.1684370398243
12952. rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers'	association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury	investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney	a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for	questioning	6935.765161958135
12953. it took some time to locate horn	93.09418719067993
12954. he was finally	found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties	away	1649.8511222371562
12955. prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there	after the shooting and began preparing an indictment	1422.3660074319446
12956. but that indictment	was never made	65.26389016759497
12957. for tom horn it turned out had a number of	rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight	faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing	3659.4951295781343
12958. the former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken	140.5527826691413
12959. the authorities had	to release him	43.41430238477949
12960. he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a ten-day	drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends	2584.2927442030273
12961. dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said! he'd	grin	496.6969339869967
12962. three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground! you	reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that	3276.5497964100387
12963. publicly he denied everything	2.9388093648120863
12964. privately he created and magnified	an image of himself as a hired assassin	1182.992935123589
12965. for a blood-chilling ring	of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for	the job he'd promised to do	2601.756907971368
12966. tom horn was soon back at work	giving his secret employers their money's worth	1407.1830302797794
12967. a good many beef-hungry	settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof	that the warning notes were not idle threats	2178.570158042866
12968. the company herds were	being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were	standing deserted	2564.578921887865
12969. but there were other homesteaders who passed the	lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his	neighbors	2321.6743746687075
12970. the rustling problem was by no means solved	250.88237415892678
12971. even	in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still	disappearing	1098.6364714821054
12972. for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of	the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his	existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant and defiant rustler named	fred powell	5923.22800073826
12973. fred was mighty crude about the way he	took in cattle his own hired man andy ross mentioned later	1724.8283006213574
12974. everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care	who knew it- even after them notes came even after he'd heard about	lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself!	on the morning of september 10 1895 powell and ross	rose at dawn and began their day's work	7884.40674481045
12975. haying time was close at	hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack	1415.456624453363
12976. harnessing	a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek	about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping	3503.9485991758165
12977. andy	ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the	distant blast of a rifle sounded	1880.1754982464936
12978. he looked around in surprise then	noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest	1397.980676795303
12979. the hired man	ran over to help his boss	262.262991911209
12980. my god i'm shot! powell	gasped	65.47440308533098
12981. and he collapsed and died instantly	43.73071335304491
12982. ross had no	intention of searching for the assassin	392.19939319203866
12983. he heaved the dead man onto	the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast	1880.1365734590993
12984. but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen	the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing	3497.0169238148287
12985. a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a	ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place	2172.440609435611
12986. there	were no tracks of either hoofs or boots	394.5616436913768
12987. not even an empty cartridge	case could be found	261.9632262718998
12988. once again tom horn was the first	and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately	2581.6673851479045
12989. once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and	his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready	2188.777234761832
12990. later	riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies	of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations	he made	4293.4420208929205
12991. exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business	proposition with me he'd blandly announce	794.0014453393131
12992. and i sort o'	got a corner on the market	564.4095204663928
12993. tom a friend asked him	once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers	640.3207155346569
12994. they wouldn't	o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down	1181.0092716548397
12995. he had lots of friends then as always	167.2706809785009
12996. even as he became widely	known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in	wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend	3704.9367395867425
12997. no man's name brought	more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo	790.201502563003
12998. well he	explained	s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope	962.243134342971
12999. which would you be most scairt of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down	644.2866755799631
13000. yeah i can see that the friend was forced to	agree	751.0488479237457
13001. but h well it just don't seem sportin' somehow!	sportin'! the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared	in amazement	1414.4999284904254
13002. sportin'! he echoed again in soft wonder	141.354721192715
13003. i	seen a lot o' things in my time	259.42353576169046
13004. i found a trooper once the apache	had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across	some teamsters they'd caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels	over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o'	their skulls	6824.133745220091
13005. i heard o' texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up	in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to	death	2461.659714259659
13006. but there's one thing i never seen or heard of one thing	i just don't think there is and that's a sportin' way o' killin'	a man!   after the first two murders the warning notes	were rarely ignored	6077.836809501656
13007. the lesson had been learned	14.887315419870683
13008. when fred powell's brother-in-law charlie keane moved	into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances	on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time	on a first notice:   if you don't leave this country	within 3 days your life will be taken the same as powell's was	7909.213976596511
13009. this was the message found tacked to the cabin door	373.2137254571769
13010. keane	left within three days	22.049231325178106
13011. all through albany and laramie counties	other men were doing the same	641.1851278252916
13012. houses of settlers who'd treated	the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were	sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards	4126.449229483137
13013. the small half-heartedly	tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle	than farming were lying fallow	1557.805611652608
13014. no cow thief could count on a jury	of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer	2124.0511389024796
13015. jury judge and executioner	were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure	that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient	brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated	4221.399657277109
13016. for three straight years tom horn patrolled the southern wyoming	pastures and how many men he killed after lewis and powell	will never be known	3896.370475532463
13017. it is possible	although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let	his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder	in the state	3107.1254692973444
13018. it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually	shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him	3264.8201230142336
13019. for that legend was growing explosively rumor was insisting	he received a price of $600 a man	1409.0369230587316
13020. a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top	rumor had it he slipped two small	rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark	5019.418454183277
13021. one thing was certain- his method was effective so	effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary	2046.300431708
13022. the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field	glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling	homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week	5767.231529188023
13023. my reputation's my stock in trade tom mentioned more	than once	501.1109331121782
13024. he evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall	in the end	1175.4610511919923
13025. he had made himself the personification of the	devil to the homesteaders	636.8360035244626
13026. but to the cattlemen who had been facing	bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced	with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different	type of legendary figure	5790.668756269538
13027. such ranchers as coble and clay and the	bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while	he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown	3229.2355100614495
13028. he made their	spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups	1172.9495795682355
13029. in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same	kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local	rodeos	2979.4124315209224
13030. the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range	waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was	threatening a beloved way of life	5002.7486046553695
13031. the wailing guitar-strumming minstrels	of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him	791.3871815538513
13032. by 1898	rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in	wyoming	1882.8446511715078
13033. when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from	the livery stable brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across	the counter	2330.7947476125028
13034. i have a little job for you charlie	250.04349964114581
13035. i'm	sure you won't mind doing me a small favor	377.56473273189476
13036. brenner's	voice was oily but summers wasn't fooled	249.91840711268247
13037. he moistened his lips	uneasily	14.832806837847897
13038. what is it you want me to do mr brenner	560.1075885034713
13039. brenner shrugged carelessly	0.20041515
13040. i just want you to take a message to diane molinari	754.1526416983078
13041. tell her	to come here to the hotel	167.71299978307738
13042. vastly relieved summers nodded	and started toward the door	393.2839693621125
13043. one thing summers brenner	said	14.783470142260416
13044. you're not to mention my name	65.36221245973562
13045. tell her curt adams	wants to see her	166.68687516447662
13046. summers pulled up short and turned around	141.50461560934173
13047. i don't know mr brenner he said haltingly	beginning to get an inkling of brenner's plans	1259.9835388703086
13048. it doesn't seem	quite right telling her a thing like that	756.5690399586698
13049. couldn't i just-	his voice trailed off into silence	263.6062863386156
13050. brenner continued to smile	but his eyes were cold	390.2264662789166
13051. he turned and looked around at the lobby	as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed	1259.845030915467
13052. you know	summers he said thoughtfully	65.10365422012771
13053. eagle's nest ought to have	a fire company	166.7955195543293
13054. if someone were to drop a match in here this place	would go up like a haystack	2137.654873544092
13055. he started toward the stairway then	turned to add tell her to come to adams's room that adams	is in trouble	2027.1955707437169
13056. yes sir	0.30041514999999996
13057. his face	pale summers headed for the street	167.10798660769473
13058. curt's visit to the	livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching	2116.879873370841
13059. he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess's buckskin	was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed	through a back window and dropped to the ground outside	3545.578730745588
13060. the	fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate	that diane's information had been wrong but curt didn't interpret	it this way	4277.078036731129
13061. a man like jess would want to have a ready means	of escape in case it was needed	1558.1182393486117
13062. probably his horse would be close	to where he was hiding	756.0648795756038
13063. from the back of the barn it was a simple	matter to reach black's house without using the street	1730.4429334064687
13064. curt	approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the	protection of a grove of trees	2362.804820449877
13065. there was a light in black's	front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior	1415.3615675587305
13066. curt circled the house and located a barn out back	562.8939134800158
13067. he could hear	horses moving around inside and nothing else	374.60608123665247
13068. there was no lock on the	door only an iron hook which he unfastened	1417.0644885310387
13069. he opened the door and	went in pulling it shut behind him	639.0337744100325
13070. again he stood in the darkness	listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank	floor	3058.154180677414
13071. he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him	and came to a wooden partition	1410.8869488700675
13072. horse smell was very strong and he could	hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws	2359.1892541455754
13073. he found	a match in his pocket and lit it	374.76276287838834
13074. there were two horses in	the barn a sway-backed dun and jess crouch's buckskin	1413.967616974032
13075. curt snuffed	out the match	14.932260468522623
13076. it was certain now that jess was in the house	but also presumably was stacey black	1880.0605690775205
13077. curt wanted to get jess	alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person	as the store owner	1737.227427401791
13078. he studied the problem for a few seconds	and thought of a means by which it might be solved	2582.9597374359746
13079. reaching across	the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump	942.4854910221087
13080. the startled	animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall	1420.758328600269
13081. as curt had hoped the house door banged open	261.6628065078558
13082. he slapped	the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of	the stall	2125.7323201681784
13083. curt moved over beside the door and waited	166.68175776533084
13084. presently	he heard footsteps crossing the yard and jess's smothered curses	756.9839457410219
13085. the door swung open and jess said sourly what the hell's	the matter with you	1102.1612641596107
13086. the horse continued to snort	22.17275656026785
13087. curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance	in its owner's voice	1246.6595558764552
13088. jess cursed again and entered	the barn	141.3531187586746
13089. a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern	which hung from a wire loop	1727.7641139525545
13090. as he crossed to the side of the	stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer	2371.5216938589697
13091. before	you try anything he said	43.41194134653702
13092. remember what happened to gruller	22.029571067730377
13093. jess caught his breath in surprise	43.37913711562707
13094. he started to reach	for his gun but apparently thought better of it	1175.735208131546
13095. that's	the stuff curt said	14.83741758936117
13096. just hold it that way	22.041443811640406
13097. he reached out	to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt	1095.7850841590125
13098. you and	i have a little talking to do jess	562.942217719656
13099. you won't be needing this	14.853442205690547
13100. he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its holster	756.4493374706389
13101. damn you adams- jess was beginning to recover from his initial	shock	644.1360697311435
13102. we ain't got nothing to talk about	140.79089402126445
13103. if i don't	come back in the house breed's going to-   your trigger-happy	brother isn't in the house	1565.533462732838
13104. about now he's probably	having supper	65.43935273884411
13105. that long ride the four of you took must've given	him a good appetite	947.929723987889
13106. now turn around so i can see your face	393.7797302290016
13107. there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his	neck were swollen	1100.4885266188583
13108. you're about as dumb as they come adams	252.31705042279032
13109. i don't know what you're up to but when brenner-	you can forget about brenner too curt said	1571.0123868683863
13110. it's	ben arbuckle we're going to talk about	248.91619304568508
13111. i don't know nothin' about him	43.65504582750306
13112. no	0.30041514999999996
13113. i suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four	either; one with blood all over it arbuckle's blood	1873.035101506292
13114. curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun	1185.1142786591076
13115. so help me crouch i'd like to kill you where you stand but	before i do i'm going to hear you admit killing him	2464.3917726000313
13116. who told you to do it	65.10175007740699
13117. was it dutch brenner	2.9509622689158506
13118. curt was holding jess's gun in his left hand	391.10668890409056
13119. he drew back his	arm to slash the gunbarrel across jess's face but didn't finish	the motion	1414.2535151447628
13120. pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone	like jess but curt couldn't bring himself to do it	2591.752051038681
13121. apparently	sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess	became bold	938.2614824126249
13122. having all the guns makes you a big man don't	it adams	966.4978541521957
13123. if we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough	379.01105494171367

13133. i	heard how you outdrew chico	43.964987101000595
13134. you're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind	and hits him with a club	2590.430309470502
13135. i just wanted to hear you say so	168.14116489081488
13136. jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his	sides	1405.0370942558252
13137. he had found curt's weakness or what to jess was a weakness	and was smart enough to take advantage of it	2019.988788017787
13138. somewhere in	the distance a woman screamed	141.04707086852866
13139. curt was too involved in his own problems	to pay much attention	639.2180502898448
13140. he had to make jess talk and he had to	do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate	3060.5301116325786
13141. once	more he lifted jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed	it into the stall with the frightened buckskin	2196.4515761167872
13142. he dropped his own	beside it	65.26679175138979
13143. we'll do it another way then he said harshly	259.2607217687464
13144. jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which	was smashed out of shape by curt's fist	2101.298194550716
13145. with a roar of pain	and fury jess made his attack	501.76595426625937
13146. curt managed to duck beneath the	man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to jess's mid-section	2374.346523756358
13147. it was like hitting a sack of salt	167.6725860405618

13149. he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with	a roundhouse right which sent him spinning	1585.7712261074055
13150. an inch lower and it	would have knocked him out	562.2627012195152
13151. as it was his vision blurred and for a moment	he was unable to move	1092.8108683628238
13152. when his eyes began to focus he saw jess	charging at him with a pitchfork	1652.519884692922
13153. curt twisted to one side	and the tines of the fork bit into the floor	1104.1215866194386
13154. jess wasted a few seconds	trying to yank them loose	554.6043664782518
13155. it gave curt time to stagger to his feet	258.86800395493265
13156. the tines broke off under jess's twisting and he swung	the handle in an attempt to knock curt's brains out	2827.1829020420614
13157. his aim was	hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over curt's head	506.9806667175906
13158. by	now curt was seeing clearly again	139.80343015021418
13159. he stepped inside jess's guard	and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he	had behind them	1884.7164664992324
13160. they made jess double over	22.256500383079857
13161. when his head came down	curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the	wall	1744.800966626039
13162. the building shook setting the lantern to swaying and	the buckskin to pitching again	1415.457108105153
13163. even black's old crowbait began	to snort and from the house black yelled jess! what's going	on out there	1723.6917599184876
13164. jess didn't seem too sure himself	64.94576674560162

13166. curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which	started at the floor	1646.9574598942982
13167. blood gushed from	his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his	own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt's fists	3107.7803740771087

13170. tell me about arbuckle! you	killed him didn't you	394.39297429110246
13171. it was brenner's idea	jess mumbled dabbing at his nose	372.93514505850163
13172. he found out about you and arbuckle	talking	252.79262527188584
13173. he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who	tried to start trouble	1091.318191597537
13174. you mean anyone who stood up	for his rights curt said	748.561336209877
13175. he let go of the shirt and jess slumped	to the floor	644.6535289352963
13176. turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached	over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the	animal's face	3687.990071193358

13183. who's in there	0.20041515

13185. curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him	into the barn	1105.0770640738751
13186. you're staying right here for a while	140.55345644097818
13187. this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle	93.5818885698592
13188. i'm going to let	him tell it to somebody else	556.9361220292619
13189. he shoved black toward the stall	and pointed his pistol at jess	644.8454173958293
13190. you're	coming along peacefully or i'll put a bullet in your leg	968.1427470895985
13191. jess stumbled through the door	14.821622928480787
13192. curt followed reaching behind him	to shut the door and hook it	958.7360219320921
13193. black would have little trouble getting	out but it might delay him a few minutes	1091.2265800904063
13194. where're you	takin' me	4.391611722472171
13195. jess asked worriedly	0.20041515
13196. we're going to	marshal woods's house	64.86000883339644
13197. maybe if the marshal hears this himself	it'll make a difference	501.7607886335074
13198. somebody in this town must still have some	backbone	389.43992210185036
13199. over his shoulder he could see max's loose grin and the burnsides'	glowering faces	948.6081165024352
13200. soon as we	send them on their way and make camp let's you and me go for a walk	down by the snake- all by ourselves	4095.5006348975794
13201. sally admonished	her mother you've got all evening to visit with dan	638.1617018710417
13202. his	wounds need dressing now	22.376969938600602
13203. mrs jackson's words recalled	dan to his lack of fitness for courting	637.2994022903601
13204. what a spectacle he was	caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an	indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely	the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world	6090.1688818190805
13205. he released her reluctantly	for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap	505.68392654578764
13206. got a lot	to tend to but i'll get back quick as i can he assured her	2110.86739128645
13207. dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up	their final reckoning for rental on the oxen	1576.5372808800005
13208. jackson was doing most	of the talking	140.8987174050962
13209. so long as sally's pa was coming out best on the	haggle dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits'	worth	2310.0845577433583
13210. soon as the burnsides moved on he'd lead rex down by the	river; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening	3686.869713157112
13211. damn	it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh	bullet hole in the sleeve	1730.48414344217
13212. if i hadn't got nate stopped when	i did my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!   he stooped	picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully	4651.432679038742
13213. from the	way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal	1246.3858976322938
13214. but his only	hat was something else again	250.40800316154164
13215. the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his	cry	636.3666731399221
13216. nate! he bellowed to the retreating back directly	in front of him	963.8442350990166
13217. i ain't going to fight you no more	167.41149435036368
13218. nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice	754.74850336093
13219. i know you ain't! dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall	370.83314347196864
13220. he moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from	nate's head and clamped it on his own	2608.1386413172854
13221. here's a present for	you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over nate's purpling	forehead	1259.8518721880423
13222. me and you's trading hats so's you'll have	something permanent to remember me by!   sally left her choring	to stand beside dan	3247.183074572042
13223. slipping her hand in his they silently watched	the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight	1890.1726494684822
13224. much as they had to look forward to they didn't begrudge a moment	of the time they spent seeing them go	3029.44062323805
13225. at first matilda	could not believe her own eyes	263.33441672859675
13226. she had spent too many hours looking	ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding	nothing but emptiness	3492.443977504748
13227. and now she could see him looking uncommon	handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front	of their trail-worn wagon	2316.254373488334
13228. seeing them waiting there at the	foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute	after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward	them matilda could not speak at all	5902.90397011013
13229. then with a glory that almost	wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face matilda leaned	over the wheel and shouted to hez who was stumbling along in the	heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon pa! pa!	i can see dan	4810.583362546301
13230. and he's with the jacksons!   what	about burnsides	251.55639663716724
13231. hez asked who still believed they'd have them	to lick	372.1313435344195
13232. they ain't even in sight! she replied	141.1777385506414
13233. by then hez could see for himself and so could the others	647.6168061840236
13234. soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing	to think that they were all back together again	2567.3181491637497
13235. but even a reunion	as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day	1885.3651541385545
13236. nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until	they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel	carried water and started their cooking fires	4994.841106508006
13237. then and only then	with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the	harrows take time to catch up on the news	2730.3319823024003
13238. no sooner did they hear	of dan's injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action	2120.6666849346047
13239. the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well	doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals	1879.4704726621526
13240. from then	on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood	the whole group settled down to relish their food	3272.7668742120873
13241. even sally in	spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting	the gab when wearing the nosebag	2174.2772227817586
13242. after their supper	the evening turned into a regular hoe-down	566.7743596245775
13243. only they	carefully	substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and	square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the	great westward migration	2986.2645077229804
13244. but with bill o'connor on the fiddle	and gran harrow exuberantly shouting glory be and hallelujah	above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played	their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real	celebration	6446.435160122894
13245. golly rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully	stood by her side among the ringed spectators don't that	fiddle make you wish the bible didn't say us baptists can't dance	3225.2144804564864
13246. nor methodists neither she replied	22.28283278333786
13247. not	that	it matters to me being this far along	372.38229643359307
13248. rod gave her a warm	pat on the shoulder before he replied	964.7185694208149
13249. come spring you'll be	kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal	940.7292180536427
13250. at these words of sympathy and understanding harmony said generously	i don't mind setting here along with gran while you go out and	join in the games	4285.438137689947
13251. rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling	group out in the circle long enough to reply i ain't much	of a hand for dare-base and farmer-in-the-dell but i'd sure	like to get in on the handhold and wrestles	4118.864445521789
13252. he looked down at his	big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers	1176.943693656771
13253. don't reckon there's	nobody out there 'cept maybe dan who can outgrip me harmony	934.7502637391065
13254. with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs	jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff	harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure	of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that	might have happened to sally	7765.504959928468
13255. and she was deeply thankful that she	could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle	skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heigh-ho	the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell	4234.037911236896
13256. at the sight	of sally's happy face and carefree expression harmony's dark brooding	eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears	2587.521953000256
13257. she was glad completely	and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right	way for both sally and dan	2169.65871168061
13258. h and she really tried to go a step	further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were	for her and for rod	4481.56890453321
13259. but she couldn't not yet	14.708275345261109
13260. not with the memory	of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close h	1868.8033649879185
13261. out in the center of the circle the farmer who was dan wasted	no time when they came to the line the farmer choose his wife	2715.9828294274516
13262. with a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed sally out of the	circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her	down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest	of their outfit	6541.208571098052
13263. soon the child the dog the cat h and even	the cheese all joined them out there in the circle	1884.62143320246
13264. by now	harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and	resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure	of the great cliff towering above them	5637.538381162139
13265. no matter how many registry	rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal	1567.7512441188903
13266. even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization	when stumbled across out here in this wilderness	3241.066239174751
13267. already	a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at	the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by	the earlier trains	3113.768830074588
13268. soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them	747.2566850283578
13269. no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the	whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep	2039.3832923303532
13270. for matilda it	was the first she had known in many a night	1192.4704358516751
13271. even the knowledge that	she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is	made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep	that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear	valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains	5254.708874051661
13272. next morning they moved on again	65.32235017509183
13273. my souls'	a-gracious! gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling	muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load	1868.4656470221823
13274. a body would	swear i floated right up here on a cloud!   rod and dan	released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged	embarrassed grins	4647.455437493732
13275. shucks gran they said almost in unison	92.71002462105237
13276. that	wasn't nothing at all!   leaning forward in her chair	gran nearsightedly scrutinized dan's face	1626.052118623834
13277. how's sally	like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising	501.8150056736321
13278. quit ragging him gran rod protested	64.78093522146062
13279. i	ain't ragging him! gran peered again at the week-old blond	mustache shadowing dan's upper lip	1255.6873006500107
13280. but honest-to-betsy i've	seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon	1180.5209579621549
13281. the two	tall	brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold	snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned	to her place at the front of the wagon with alice	3922.0589841881642
13282. rheumatics	worse pa	0.30041514999999996
13283. dan asked hez who had limped back from his	team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung	up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends	3447.7358199251494
13284. my right	leg's stiff as a board this morning he replied	759.371146889878
13285. but the sun'll	fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling	643.6897650064045
13286. the three	men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens' signal	1409.5666172545716
13287. hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock official signboard	for the raft river turnoff and gloated seems funny that	them burnsides never took time to leave their john-henry up thar	3531.902724024347
13288. wonder what made them hurry so rod drawled giving	dan a sly wink	1183.9491294401005
13289. dan grinned and changed the subject	43.66087366552959
13290. from	now on sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it	comes up and fall in behind you and rod's outfit	4270.334896003669
13291. ain't	no sense you eating our dust rod protested	263.5887395105052
13292. sally	and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along	dan explained	2352.8350814201303
13293. jackson recruited his critters and him and	me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up	2027.914993080045
13294. he's	got the tightest running gear in the train now	557.3171083684124
13295. besides 'tain't	no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's i can	unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch	3092.793740320504
13296. captain	clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting	teams	964.95168046464
13297. reckon ye're right dan hez called back over	his shoulder	373.3372662785549
13298. i'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o'	the canyon	1178.414702214598
13299. rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing	precipice-walled gorge	261.593198601647
13300. we'll double teams zigzagging up the	mountain harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched	look around her mouth	2607.3423106837417
13301. like enough we'll all be up on top by	sundown	372.58968722781185
13302. out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's	wheels beginning to turn	1889.6406059328856
13303. before harmony had a chance	to reply rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs h	1576.640891725968
13304. while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had	the	appearance of being far busier and more prosperous	2831.9018155562035
13305. men crowded the streets	and freight rigs and teams were moving about	641.58934651898
13306. although they were	forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride	in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid	them	4259.0720643940185
13307. gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's	here at all cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched	their legs	2338.297611044957
13308. there were no less than six or seven saloons	in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade	of celebrating miners and teamsters	4270.188087515775
13309. take one	side of the street and i'll take the other he proposed	791.4459406758359
13310. if	you spot carmer give a yell before you move in	753.3471231572755
13311. you do the same	2.947439524859786
13312. it's all i ask stevens	22.29411501873435
13313. separating they took different sides of the main drag and	systematically combed the bars	944.4310528786273
13314. russ visited two places without result	and his blood pressure was down to zero	1404.7473611911628
13315. suddenly it seemed to him	insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually even were	he to prove the thief	2308.2376548435645
13316. he tramped out of the miners rest with his	hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the	last place of any consequence on this side of the street	4825.333195589827
13317. the	palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in	front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch	2313.4071717592988
13318. behind	its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest	to the rocky ribs of the canyonside	2598.145343516603
13319. russ ran up the steps quickly to	the plank porch	376.5772537164552
13320. the front windows of the place were long and narrow	reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of	the interior	3690.6135331394667
13321. heading for the batwings cobb glanced perfunctorily	through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside	1104.1838755366261
13322. nerves tight as	a bowstring he paused to gather his wits	755.7240401388115
13323. against all expectation	carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already	so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything	or anyone about him	3220.600469102318
13324. fierce anger surged through russ	22.25649861227876
13325. he fought	down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot	1254.4305790559051
13326. reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he	feverishly scanned the busy street below	2143.257754325071
13327. stevens was nowhere in sight	14.858318691208936
13328. muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran	down	973.5124079856525
13329. as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before	pat appeared	1254.6025309269614
13330. what luck cobb	0.30041514999999996
13331. he said swiftly	0.20041515
13332. he's there he got out tersely	curbing his rising excitement	560.4039313800607
13333. hitching his cartridge belt around pat	glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb	at his side	2033.2135061044896
13334. climbing the steps steadily they reached the	top and headed for the door	1173.6126725077497
13335. forced behind	him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside	787.6782463263986
13336. while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene	of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now	as somnolent and dull as the day before payday	5012.778150481017
13337. carmer himself was nowhere	to be seen	93.662108010217
13338. a man knocked the roulette ball about idly	in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables	2812.8100980431545
13339. two men murmured	with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed	bartender absently polished a glass	2029.421827416428
13340. looking the setup over	stevens started coolly for the rear of the place	1187.6904368521502
13341. where yuh	goin'	0.20041515
13342. it was the barkeep	4.430033659733095
13343. halting pat turned to	survey him deliberately	93.60676048018544
13344. he did not reply going on toward the back	394.96391914421235
13345. less	assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead cobb followed	alertly a hand on his gun butt	1730.8098214448069
13346. the bartender measured this situation	with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it	1876.9882670633203
13347. a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell	643.0773543835729
13348. small rooms probably for cards opened off on	either	side	560.5976862459954
13349. all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was	toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder	2730.3059112158394
13350. a single kick made it spring open	shuddering	250.0214246407309
13351. pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle	upraised	as if to strike	942.4049712852454
13352. russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside	248.72501967214453
13353. with a bellow carmer lunged at him	93.80269441707127
13354. but he was more than half-drunk	and his faculties were dulled	751.2822931914562
13355. cobb unleashed a single powerful jab	that sent gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan	1575.7579201417282
13356. he started to struggle up heaving desperately	140.51898594188177
13357. russ gave him a brutal	thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach	938.6150143537691
13358. kneeling cobb	planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned	1655.8867286478944
13359. i've drawn his fangs he snapped	43.54887294227787
13360. go	through his pockets will you	65.81729953041244
13361. if we have to we'll take him apart	and see what he's made of!   complying methodically	pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing	2851.811919616387
13362. cobb	watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment	1186.1217444350882
13363. stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly	rose and lunged toward carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen	feet away when he first fell	2868.419925915391
13364. straightening up his	eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson	752.9466219567145
13365. look at	this!   inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband	could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency	1724.4016626570417
13366. carmer's ingenious	cache for his loot had been found	391.53997097089893
13367. by golly stevens!	you were right russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out	of carmer's hat	1248.2558080338044
13368. that is if we can be sure this is colcord's	money-   pat grunted	1181.8241696738298
13369. where else would he get it	43.20188127778542
13370. count	what you've got there cobb	65.17213530151922
13371. russ	ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any	cowpuncher would come by honestly	1730.8254654132695
13372. it's within a	hundred of what crip had he declared	557.5394345210996
13373. we know penny spent some-	and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on	1404.3681616651234
13374. handing the money over russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs	as if ridding himself of something unclean	2362.6695203625395
13375. his glance at gyp	carmer was disdainful	92.67441231080275
13376. shall we get out of here	64.65951948150548
13377. leaving	the card room they moved back through the palace the way they	had come	1102.656630620641
13378. glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt	to halt them	1638.7894064367792
13379. pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat	looked his unspoken warning and stepped out	1415.1675193633168
13380. he and cobb clattered	down the high steps to the street	763.1464383557534
13381. neither spoke till they reached	their horses	93.31294663615813
13382. pat paused there looking across at the young fellow	391.8439677263508
13383. it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord	and tell him about it russ	1568.515125368634
13384. he started to return it	22.01173378826659
13385. to	his faint surprise russ held up his hand	259.71468772422077
13386. not me he ruled decidedly	22.44894989725071
13387. it was you that tracked it down anyway stevens	he pursued strictly	644.6883916168224
13388. whatever you say	0.30041514999999996
13389. pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed	his brows puckered	637.9059864907633
13390. you owe it to penny to give her a chance	to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly	3035.7461221450267
13391. old crip wasn't retorted cobb tartly	43.421637757091
13392. he'll	know when you tell him	65.47086949026878
13393. but i want this to sink in awhile	166.20539965629092
13394. then maybe	next time he won't be so quick on the trigger	962.0160353950589
13395. pat	had never pretended to give advice in such affairs	370.3826232773779
13396. you're the	doctor he returned with a smile	250.4994240348642
13397. but i still think penny's	an awful nice girl russ-   you don't have to tell	me flashed cobb	1579.4169892125763
13398. giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc	around and trotted down off the street	2141.696008478389
13399. pat let him go following	more leisurely	94.52424640427157
13400. at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in	for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open	range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells	for antler	6324.374474362429
13401. the truth was the puncher was both bewildered	and dismayed by his own mixed luck	1104.334087759537
13402. penny's always glad to see me	over there he mused bleakly	751.1729465383457
13403. yet had he not visited the girl at	saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle	1880.2791192101133
13404. over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck	stober's part in recent events	1858.25180299483
13405. gyp carmer couldn't have	known about colcord's money unless he was told- and who else would	have told him	1718.7227856453123
13406. he asked himself	0.30041514999999996
13407. it's the second time war	ax hands made a play for that money	783.6576497862461
13408. how much of an accident	could that be	250.80964654754453
13409. nearing home he jerked to attention at	the distant crack of a gun	786.3092579012946
13410. in town no one paid much attention to an	occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had a meaning	2598.4422608266636
13411. hauling up	russ listened carefully	14.966313919925563
13412. two minutes later it came again- a double	explosion followed by a third sounding more distant	1888.097504756109
13413. as near	as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the	antler ranch house	1427.0478855455171
13414. he tightened up in a twinkling	65.51659060743825
13415. so far as he knew	only his father could be there	501.09576061301425
13416. what did it mean	4.434275314929099
13417. clapping spurs	to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm	1099.5737242558776
13418. his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells	told	him nothing	1409.2661936778154
13419. still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served	to increase his speed	1102.740025486173
13420. setting a course straight for the house	he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his	face	3265.3607424365746
13421. when it was followed by a second whining even closer	cobb	swerved sharply aside into a depression	1418.0737524495532
13422. he knew now what he was	up against	248.60635094900402
13423. whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging	the antler house and having spotted his approach was determined	to drive him off before he could get into the fight	3460.1090129879294
13424. cursing	himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in	his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly	3884.2637075237485
13425. if he	wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested	he had his answer a moment later	1877.7655596877648
13426. over this way! he ain't	gone far! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush	1874.0208192476912
13427. a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the	brush off at one side	1433.229936968884
13428. the would-be assassin had his position figured	pretty close	392.1170650622364
13429. dismounting russ looked about hastily	14.86087457009279
13430. toward the	west this depression led toward a draw	392.84239989393643
13431. leading his pony he hurried	that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding	range	1871.7992855252826
13432. swinging up then and bending forward over the	horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw	2120.755917597313
13433. he had not covered	a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind	943.7022502194504
13434. he had	been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot	757.7464904569358
13435. a shot or two	went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot	934.7913988892778
13436. a slug had torn	half of his stirrup-guard away	390.0687719328458
13437. a second twitched his shirtsleeve	and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm	1102.5004850567059
13438. jumping jerusalem! let's get out of here!	at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward	the side of the winding draw	4095.6601963910834
13439. the long minute before he reached effective	cover seemed endless	374.26694299839227
13440. sweeping a look around he saw that he	was safe for the moment	1178.7426069651742
13441. he heard cries from behind him but he could	make out no words	790.4494847742759
13442. he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in	the draw and made it	1409.603216611698
13443. recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an	intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed	1104.2341095895322
13444. gradually	the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range	560.8710466352376
13445. yet he must	chance it	14.694829684336316
13446. he clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt	flying behind him and flashed a look about	2366.66758491931
13447. early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned	missions	788.8476984594442
13448. and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat	record	753.3959361841279
13449. every plane that could fly was sent into the air	376.0548144392282
13450. cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along	the north coast of mindanao to cagayan	2583.2846782444735
13451. anything the enemy flew	or floated was his target	259.9150155201911
13452. fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte	gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they	got to the ships	3660.497111938469
13453. greg himself took two flights with todman leading	the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around	ormoc on the east coast of leyte	2715.9286826694006
13454. each plane carried two five-hundred	pound bombs	141.30902322919752
13455. a weapons carrier took greg todman belton	banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the	bivouac area to the strip	2472.644853411672
13456. it was a rough long ride through the mud	and pot holes	959.0539496286747
13457. no one had much to say	43.21393395887975
13458. the sky glowered down at them	65.09975181716649
13459. there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the	others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever	2862.324336962499
13460. the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread	through the jungle	1187.4631305478224
13461. donovan snatched greg's chute from him with	a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it	1575.9566486674714
13462. his face was	dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his	pilot	2825.8053317916333
13463. greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been	in one before	1104.9647250404046
13464. but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically	adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure	1877.3923610892002
13465. i've	got her as neat as i can donovan said as he dropped the straps	of the seton harness over greg's shoulders	2192.9450249727415
13466. it's for carabao not airplanes	22.14803093178907
13467. don't you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself	believed it	637.7958672118491
13468. see you donovan said as he jumped	off the wing	564.930745927955
13469. the expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to	good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return	2032.1200886684594
13470. at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out	745.8206684742233
13471. from	the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight	he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip	2451.773925168667
13472. he wondered where	the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief	to watch his plane take off on a combat mission	4085.21796965529
13473. yet long before the	scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck	in the sky	1571.1847809570024
13474. greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and	one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him	3271.83582157574
13475. the dark	brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful	642.4961482107277
13476. the	pilots' heads looked ridiculously small	65.12637004161628
13477. the control tower gave him	immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that	took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan	3100.1373833211082
13478. greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships	off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again	3482.898356612716
13479. to the west	the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway	up their slopes	1720.4955863639923
13480. underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray	561.1935447202982
13481. water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and	out of showers	1091.494064753067
13482. the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black	against the green jungle around it	2121.090495485831
13483. he possessed the fighter pilot's	horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if	the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to	find their way back in this unfamiliar territory	4055.6814447215684
13484. he shivered in the	warm cockpit	64.93379404066808
13485. the overcast was solid above him	43.50021722104191
13486. as far as he	could see there was no hole to climb through it	1409.1424612140534
13487. they would have to	go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar	and hope that it didn't close in before they returned	2715.8087928002474
13488. greg	pushed the radio button on his throttle	252.0795150804624
13489. todman let's try	to go under this stuff	167.40227864001577
13490. stay in close and we'll go up the valley	393.9305036391966
13491. roger sweeney todman called back and pulled his four	in and slightly above greg	938.1554329796896
13492. greg took the formation wide	around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf	2092.5779104015955
13493. he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of	the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against	the mountain	2724.682816557766
13494. the valley was only a few hundred yards wide	with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree	turn	2826.909110662794
13495. it was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was	through greg felt	himself developing a case of claustrophobia	1716.0855840876018
13496. the ceiling	stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times	the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in	3252.7622745112035
13497. if the other pilots were worried	they did not show it	498.1062971589523
13498. when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if	the sun had come out	2833.6387820608397
13499. he spread the flight out and led them across a	point of land and then down the coast	1567.0401383053095
13500. although they drew light ground	fire they saw no signs of activity	956.8250635571958
13501. once todman thought he	had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him	1421.8610166967442
13502. somebody beat us to it! todman said over the radio as he	came back up in formation	2122.340402920686
13503. visibility continued to be limited	and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet	1251.453013479082
13504. his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts	made by other flights	1646.663032661625
13505. he thought once that he identified the somewhat	hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill	1106.9466325706712
13506. but greg's	area remained as placid as a florida dawn	565.0674923195006
13507. finally as time	began to run out he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses	that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies	2600.289001181676
13508. the low clouds made bombing difficult	65.35897101855086
13509. there was not enough room to	make the usual vertical bomb run	639.1709793613959
13510. one	of greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he	could get rid of it	2810.7553382121673
13511. only one of the flight scored a direct hit and	the rest blew up jungle	1104.0315264052424
13512. with their load of bombs gone the planes	moved swiftly and easily	959.1920983468424
13513. greg went up tight against the ceiling	and led them back to their pass to home	1256.3864416159877
13514. mercifully it was still open	22.14721921548896
13515. like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged	back into the valley	1419.8053290725352
13516. he was about to make a gas check on his flight	when todman's voice broke in: sweeneys! three bogies	2593.822105347682
13517. greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument	panel	167.83971421116647
13518. he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast	557.198329146913
13519. they were headed straight for each other on a collision course	504.06851291925597
13520. friend	or enemy	0.30041514999999996
13521. the same old question	2.94200984901578
13522. and only a few seconds to answer	it	246.97295989741573
13523. zeros! todman said excitedly and hopefully	43.86864570227941
13524. and then he thought todman might be right	248.42767642366238
13525. his mind flicked	through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification	1109.8319029859115
13526. he narrowed the shape down to two: either a zero or a u	s navy type aircraft	2137.398220504353
13527. if it were the enemy tactically	his position was correct	375.8882401402148
13528. japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability	american on speed and firepower	748.8774328571101
13529. his present maximum altitude	up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his	advantages	1256.7895370553197
13530. but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was	the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already	2824.5339047773177
13531. but the closing aircraft	showed no sign of deviating from their original course	790.4218892539177
13532. in	seconds greg made his decision	65.0055899050807
13533. he pushed the radio button	14.996413394096455
13534. sweeney blue hit the deck	22.317855172026096
13535. todman you take	the one on the left	168.40144983082808
13536. belton the one on the	right	65.58003322395714
13537. if h if they're japs	14.791575766952937
13538. greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two	rogers	1653.5684020829444
13539. the planes light with most of the gas burned	out responded beautifully	639.2699770096012
13540. greg's airspeed indicator was over 350	when he leveled off just above the trees	1419.2178973644086
13541. the opposing aircraft continued	to come on	94.11778226756567
13542. they appeared to be the enemy	65.72748575784617
13543. greg wished the air	corps had continued to camouflage planes	377.0547684746276
13544. there was of course no	way for the other planes to get by them	1406.3417051797878
13545. but they could	turn and escape to the east	260.26844008540246
13546. greg pushed the radio button again	65.7549783983451
13547. todman drop your second element back	43.37404760373205
13548. if any of us miss they	can pick up the pieces	751.1318140084929
13549. now let's make sure they're japs	43.374786618945286
13550. even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy	961.1273647815162
13551. the	shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly	brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom	1569.0380698677911
13552. greg slapped his hand	across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight	2370.9183439323815
13553. the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector	glass in front of him	1725.782381732169
13554. arm your guns sweeneys	4.434130695987212
13555. they're japs came a high-pitched	voice	44.122130928746564
13556. one pass only	0.30041514999999996
13557. you'll bust your ass in this canyon	93.11065380114988
13558. he moved the flights over against one wall	251.53039195225318
13559. it gave them	all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away	that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery	3115.3335000351544
13560. if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out	1183.1756073232043
13561. a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done	943.6579413106581
13562. greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm	and the engine responded as if it had been waiting	3494.7677506619207
13563. the clearly	identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around	795.952279829032
13564. they	haven't seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise	959.1667313503971
13565. he hit the radio button	14.996413394096455
13566. let's take 'em home	4.427146892561248
13567. he hauled back on the	stick and felt his cheeks sag	501.2522801836661
13568. out of the corner of his eye he watched	his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him	2821.986262953043
13569. with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below	the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could	be done	2602.5800799514286
13570. just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer	from a diving board	1413.7065306933223
13571. his nose up	0.20041515
13572. it	was going to be dangerous	64.75913770540915
13573. eight aircraft in this small box	43.18186878236261
13574. please	dear god make my pilots good he prayed	393.2338113022878
13575. he took a lead on	the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight	and then added another	2333.422811949178
13576. the enemy did not veer	22.25473801810178
13577. it did not seem possible	that they hadn't been spotted	369.8045051367294
13578. now!	greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger	249.73663895884624
13579. the plane rumbled	and slowed	14.837437646986547
13580. six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished	755.0597280390604
13581. as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them	503.03352173243985
13582. greg tightened his	turn until the plane shuddered	248.71966939894483
13583. his burst held	for a second on the engine section of the plane	784.3307182008411
13584. the jap's propeller	flew off in pieces	140.8814323728559
13585. a large piece of engine cowling vanished	93.04359523254479
13586. it	was all greg had time to see	250.4400482473321
13587. his maneuvering for the shot had placed	him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds	1736.6775304764553
13588. his speed was dropping rapidly	22.15023051078773
13589. if he spun out now he would join	his opponent on the ground	788.8540427865435
13590. wingman stay clear he prayed	22.382086246447336
13591. he	pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back	643.1335766900727
13592. he fought	the panic of vertigo	64.95556626765725
13593. he had no idea which was up and which was	down	499.4949734092803
13594. he held the controls where they had been	250.12002068866087
13595. sweat popped out over	him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip	1420.6454009168879
13596. his	air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out	751.7379122638628
13597. over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering	of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles	2172.531051324661
13598. cool	air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted	of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance	of perfume swirled from the back seat	4511.766627237359
13599. moriarty my driver	suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone	i	once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of	hypocrisy to sound convinced	3225.218269386215
13600. we were coming to an intersection	turning right chuffing to a stop	958.5603286458032
13601. forced to realize that	this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered	what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old	mexican: moriarty new mexico	3952.0730264130666
13602. adios i	said exhausting my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one	of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters	3476.3645160313813
13603. i	waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading	through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass	2329.530638218197
13604. then	i saw the father's head slightly turn; gauche rainbow shapes replaced	the poignant ovals of gold	2119.0751261989944
13605. white-shirted	and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward	the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze	1420.7489893365514
13606. suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully	i saw emergent in windshield flash: red lips streaming silk	of blonde hair and- ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension	despair- the leering face of old herry	5771.897213070793
13607. mor-ee-air-teeeee	he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of	the glittering blonde	787.7184759122828
13608. over the rapidly-diminishing outline of	a jump seat piled high with luggage herry's black brushcut was just	discernible near or enviably near that spot where- hidden- more	delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming	back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca	flowers and engine fumes	7632.804019517612
13609. i would have foregone	my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty	and- well at least i wouldn't have shouted back a taunt	2728.0475928561245
13610. still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly	approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me	2342.388519917555
13611. just as i straightened up with my duffel bag i heard: sahjunt	yoorick meet mrs major j a roebuck	1731.6961451853465
13612. the	voice	was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew	747.0740578336461
13613. squeezing	a look between johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome	and still darkhaired lady inquired y'all drahve	1882.0924207963867
13614. i	nodded	0.30041514999999996
13615. onleh one thiihng mrs roebuck continued	43.5514527602168
13616. ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in sante fe an y'all maht	prefuh the suhthuhn rewt	1899.4957857649686
13617. but corporal johnson has alreadeh said it	didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im	637.851396645249
13618. i said that it didn't	make any difference to me either as far as i knew	1869.1082190742327
13619. how far	i knew will shortly become apparent	165.55861675971045
13620. let me pass over the trip to sante	fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck	wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit is still	in ee-faket	4663.627071658471
13621. i let up on the accelerator only to gradually	reach again the 60 mph which would i hoped overhaul herry	and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had	something more important to catch than had i mrs major roebuck	settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles	she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody	in sante fe	0.20124717349522497
13622. when johnson ejaculated howsabout my	buying us all a nice cold co-cola ma'am	1185.8117123247623
13623. mrs roebuck smilingly	declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh	a little younguh than you bawhs	2171.9341899032543
13624. johnson never would	have believed she had a son that age	756.306994196561
13625. mrs roebuck thought johnson	was a sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet but her herman was getting	to be a man there was no getting around it	2714.118508184706
13626. just befoh he left	foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh major roebuck	an ah an huhmun says 'may ah hev one too'	4092.1231413695336
13627. just as	p'lite an- an cohnfidunt an ah says 'uh coahse you cain't'	but he says 'whah nawt you ah hevin one'	2177.1696946925285
13628. an ah coudn ansuh	him an so ah said 'aw right ah gay-ess an his fathuh didn uttuh	one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me	thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh	a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn	mah back an ah doan think thet's nahce at all d'you	8851.060702618666
13629. no i don't johnson said	14.769644226180109
13630. i'm a good baptist	and drinking h	mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive	through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos	and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico	5916.780508593563
13631. how lightly	her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where i was storing	dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word	would echo	2622.8349379991146
13632. hardly had mrs roebuck driven	off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of senor	moriarty's ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop	and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what	had once been the side window	6681.375615503392
13633. the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose	plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back	1889.1415345794273
13634. johnson unwired	the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped	fragments of glass and johnson wadded himself into a narrow	seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer	5623.5812635637985
13635. in	back buddy the driver said to me	166.29994282170406
13636. quickly but carefully	lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack i stepped on the running	board; it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin	4319.032991472559
13637. the truck	was hurtling forward	14.694375355196566
13638. i seized the rack and made a western-style	flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel	bag- and merely wrecking my camera i was to discover later-	my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and- but this	is no medical report	7357.641868398714
13639. i was again in motion and at a speed	which belied the truck's similarity to senor x's ford turtle	1729.0418817597013
13640. maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all	565.2107610949578
13641. whatever satisfaction	that might offer	14.873996438112258
13642. i	drew back drawing back my foot for a kick	562.0830279668669
13643. but it was only johnson	reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck	cab's glassless rear window	1883.546829273241
13644. the way his red rubber lips were stretched	across his pearly little teeth i though he was only having a	little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind	so he could roar something into my ear	6697.918644506533
13645. wanna beer	0.20041515
13646. hell yes i roared back between dusty lips	248.0746774112306
13647. did i	want a beer	14.88032702360762
13648. did an anteater want ants	22.110257789019695
13649. bueno amigo	0.20041515
13650. gracias i hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence	and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary	2818.771695514987
13651. at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish	but- the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly	veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle-	it could have	been the purest oxford english i was half hearing; i	wouldn't have known the difference	5210.18777893367
13652. johnson was trying to	grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from	it	2597.4917005355564
13653. white teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of	his bottle against johnson's ear	1094.4669858079076
13654. we were off the road gleaming	barbed wire pulling taut	562.1538979470854
13655. i ducked just as the first strand broke	somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards	1582.917834563071
13656. we	were in a field in a tight screeching turn	564.4424257048888
13657. prairie dogs were popping	up and popping down	166.65851951409957
13658. when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering	755.0002225298363
13659. just as i got to my knees there was again the sound	of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling	posture seriously	2987.5919834404335
13660. this time no wire came whipping into the truck	394.0773247109077
13661. we were back on the road	43.981664429681025
13662. i regained my squatting position	behind the truck cab's rear window	753.697253054479
13663. johnson's left hand was pressed	against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers	1409.1642014148447
13664. tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering	behind dull silver chicken fencing	1177.5258260509374
13665. that was tee-wah i was	talking	43.45207766289009
13666. you thought i was a mexican didn't you buddy	394.152493466622
13667. i nodded	0.20041515
13668. hell that's all right buddy the indian	said	250.3913141926257
13669. miraculously	the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my	waterproof watch	1086.0165474855582
13670. no sooner had i started drinking than the driver	started zigzagging the truck	1187.2157462689572
13671. i drank	furiously	0.20041515
13672. emptied the bottle	0.30041514999999996
13673. teeth again flashing	back at me the driver released a deluge of spanish in which amigo	appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of	surrounding sound	3233.6404648120547
13674. i bobbed my head each time it appeared	249.8570341020226
13675. suddenly	the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged	with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated	by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnson's quivering ribs	3555.3222817765854
13676. a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning	389.7834800729546
13677. beyond	it the gray road stretched a long long way	374.9889115599751
13678. the car was just about to	us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business	on a family in sante fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck	in which two human beings desperately needed rescue	6335.950455652064
13679. high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off	the car's steel roof	949.3000248239845
13680. on unoccupied roadway the bottle	shattered into a small amber flash	758.9689666064027
13681. aye-yah-ah-ah!	the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief-	probably only a fraction of johnson's- the bottle this time	went to the indian's lips	2980.3161546977612
13682. another car was coming a tiny	dark shape on a far hill	968.8099835615419
13683. i started looking on the splintery truck	bed for a piece of board a dirt clod- anything i could throw and	with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle	3351.589195375311
13684. in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional	pebble discernible faintly gleaming	1648.4595019471478
13685. but johnson couldn't quickly	unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer	1097.2256000040265
13686. the car was approaching fast	22.037617869879742
13687. on the truck bed there was nothing smaller	than a piece of rusty machinery; with more time i could have	loosened a small burr or cotter pin-   suddenly and not a second	too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket	4376.714213087901
13688. there was no time to	pick out a penny; i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned	my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck	cab and flipped my little missile	6214.827390760837
13689. there was a blur just under	my focus of vision a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned	into a silver web with a dark hole in the center	3126.388736779736
13690. i heard	the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me	1638.7013757693326
13691. looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car	and trying to read our license number	1870.4773042099048
13692. johnson's	fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab	and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own	lips	3484.37834634876
13693. two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing	503.4330061210726
13694. the indian's arm whipped sidewise- there was a flash of amber	and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of	the first car	4107.597780358474
13695. i saw johnson's	bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind	the second car	2035.769736526828
13696. this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking	of women	1182.8693110801155
13697. i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated	oval of the car's rear window	1255.3518725165789
13698. drink you son of a bitch!	i quickly turned around and began to drink	1419.5754589676712
13699. but the indian was	jabbing another bottle toward johnson	260.43157790845123
13700. i guided her to the divan turned off the tv faced her	965.372143421628
13701. she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes	374.52464679104924
13702. and what eyes they	were	21.931163547081724
13703. big and dark a melting golden brown	94.90838891448354
13704. eyes like hot honey	eyes that sizzled	140.37196177218067
13705. plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that	looked as if you could get a shock from them	1732.7547888563718
13706. it was a disturbingly	familiar face too but i couldn't remember where we had met	1653.877812630859
13707. i said do we know each other miss	166.4405282241923
13708. no i	remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and	when it happened all i could think of was- this time she stopped	the rush of words herself	5310.672199403298
13709. shall i go on	2.9569513525194884
13710. she smiled	0.30041514999999996
13711. it was her first smile	14.877732352381946
13712. but one word at a time ok	140.22470141735474
13713. she	was	still hugging the stained coat around her so i said relax let	me take your things	1568.1216212062006
13714. would you like a drink or coffee	141.1361270196323
13715. no thanks	0.20041515
13716. she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and	started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and i	let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out	5477.199059975117
13717. she	was wearing nothing beneath the coat	94.02346415794304
13718. she jerked the coat back on and	squeezed it around her again but not soon enough	1864.0309657536993
13719. there had been a	good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and	now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before	2723.708096893676
13720. oh do forgive me	4.391611722472171
13721. i'm sorry!	i forgive-   that's what started all the trouble in	the first place	941.7439307700506
13722. oh dear i'm all unstrung	22.295528907677657
13723. you and	me both dear	14.824293329138612
13724. haven't we h haven't i seen you h	253.86907454718744
13725. i mean	surely we've-   you may have seen me on tv	she said	784.8644652447288
13726. i've done several filmed commercials for-	then it hit me	553.4579874313723
13727. and	you recognized me	2.9297641017805476
13728. yes indeed	0.30041514999999996
13729. in fact i was watching	you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell	1261.715951006258
13730. man you rang- it was in color too miss and h miss	954.356771964444
13731. what's	your name anyway	2.974513604433913
13732. ah you were splendid	4.441884930864264
13733. i sat by her on	the divan	94.46702061335215
13734. in a waterfall h and all that	140.62601802998773
13735. that's	the last one we did	43.395933609941345
13736. that was a fun one	22.27883954022354
13737. it was fun for me all right	93.07594098731124
13738. i don't mean to pry but do	they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles	1401.7183494922256
13739. i mean: is advertising	honest	14.932021357728388
13740. it depends on who does it	64.77767386923932
13741. i never wear anything	at all	43.28083683749941
13742. it wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair somehow	65.12908269579017
13743. i couldn't agree with you more	43.93003861481375
13744. i really do have something	important to tell you mr scott	747.4427745312894
13745. murder	0.20041515
13746. oh yeah i said	4.41411768167019
13747. tell me about the murder	14.989579559124598
13748. zing was the creation of two men louis	thor and bill blake partners in zing! inc	1872.698237916872
13749. they'd	peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until	about a year ago when- with the addition of sx-21 to their	secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising	campaign- sales had soared practically into orbit	4129.024543749819
13750. their product had	been endorsed by good housekeeping the ama and the	veterinary journal among other repositories of higher wisdom	and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in	the john even your best friends would think you didn't bathe	6933.578678980232
13751. my lovely caller- joyce holland was her name- had previously	done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth	a super production had been filmed at the home of louis thor	3554.1395529722295
13752. the water in thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket	of thick foamy soapsuds- fashioned of course from zing-	joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted	in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled	6575.013884200882
13753. the finished-	and drastically cut- product would begin with a hazy longshot of	joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad	in layers of lavender lather and i had a hunch this item was going	to sell tons and tons of soap; even to clean men and boys	4999.807222162667
13754. joyce went on when we'd finished lou- mr thor- asked	me to stay a little longer	1882.8372674387458
13755. he wanted a few stills for magazine ads	he said	375.76278287359526
13756. everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came	back alone and leaped into the pool too	2616.8709556449844
13757. and he didn't have any clothes	on	93.67440407406177
13758. he didn't!   yes he didn't	22.20616494893359
13759. did leap into the pool and didn't	have anything on	375.62542515342653
13760. anyway it was evident what he had in mind	393.35516759292943
13761. you got away didn't you	14.904918324547197
13762. yes	0.30041514999999996
13763. he	caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with zing-	it's very slippery you know	2026.554919605836
13764. i wouldn't have the stuff in the house	251.29614321762907
13765. but i'm pleased to	hear-   so i just scooted out of his clutches	787.9879171225873
13766. i swam	like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car	2136.040286473039
13767. the	keys were still in it and i was miles away before i remembered	that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana	where i'd changed	3201.1364410007855
13768. she'd driven around for a while	joyce said then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that	time she'd gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked	in front and walked toward the pool	5933.653115237948
13769. while several yards from it still	concealed by the shrubbery she'd seen two men on her left at the	pool's edge	2030.4185418928441
13770. she went on:   a man was holding onto lou	holding him up	960.0349867483746
13771. maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i	thought he must be dead	941.8050125844659
13772. the man shoved him into the water then ran	past the cabana	969.5918181433024
13773. there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive	370.9955493388121
13774. i was so scared h well i just ran to my car and came here	1661.145510788227
13775. you know who the other man was	93.48356730003994
13776. no i never	did see his face	140.3099474129915
13777. i didn't get a good look at him at all his back	was to me and i was so scared h it was just somebody in a man's	suit	3102.2821171950372
13778. but i'm sure the other one was lou	251.29628111442815
13779. what joyce	wanted me to do was go to thor's house and do whatever detectives	do and get her clothes- and handbag containing her identification	2603.0107537084277
13780. she realized i'd have to notify the police but fervently	hoped i could avoid mentioning her name	2127.6266980329347
13781. her impact in the	zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent	part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a	documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits	3545.9996575437385
13782. but if joyce	got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably	go to the sponsor's wife mrs oatnut grits	3289.843397358545
13783. or at least not	to joyce	43.0416862890513
13784. and i so want the part she said	249.48328075628575
13785. the	commercials have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive	for me to do them but in underwater western eye i'd	have a chance to act	3089.984956190935
13786. i could show what i can do	141.45716916167962
13787. as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what	she could do	1421.9586539973477
13788. but i promised joyce i would mention her name if	at all only as a last resort	2131.8251387924283
13789. seeming much relieved she smiled one	of those worth-waiting-for smiles and i smiled all the way into the	bedroom	1728.4219056439074
13790. there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped	my coat on and went back into the front room	2831.3619271095813
13791. joyce squirmed	a little on the divan	94.62733664027714
13792. i'm starting to itch she said	64.94981894302921
13793. itch	0.20041515
13794. yes i'm still all covered with that	soap	248.62166983387706
13795. i was loaded with suds when i ran away and i haven't had a	chance to wash it off	1731.4154401821386
13796. you might	as well wait here while i'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd	like	2354.176948426457
13797. i showed her the shower	and tub and she said smiling if you really don't mind i think	i'll get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your	tub	3558.697089934204
13798. doesn't it you	0.30041514999999996
13799. only	when i do it	14.856430688317536
13800. one of my virtues or vices is	a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and	glorious living color	2823.1425542352504
13801. soak h as long as you want joyce	166.6467648264967
13802. it'll	probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with	you	1900.3770744150818
13803. so you'll have everything all to yourself doggone h	i looked at my watch	939.7195321314948
13804. time to go i supposed	22.12109445403689
13805. you'd better hurry	0.20041515
13806. oh you can count on that	65.02219699266188
13807. warmly	0.20041515
13808. i'll be soaking	for h at least half an hour	564.1986132154968
13809. that was all she said	14.803741737111531
13810. but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms	of bees in them	1637.3829690349794
13811. however when there's a job to be done i'm	a monstrosity of grim determination i like to think	1569.3288930097256
13812. i spun about	and clattered through the front room to the door	967.3713889120557
13813. as i went out i	could hear water pouring in the shower	642.6770214859446
13814. she wouldn't be	taking a cold shower	141.11009855858237
13815. bryn mawr drive	is only two or three miles from the spartan and it took me less than	five minutes to get there	2319.327136202818
13816. but the scene was not the quiet calm scene	i'd expected	748.9485482300659
13817. four cars were parked at the curb and two of them	were police radio cars	1096.1113655696329
13818. lights blazed in the big house and surrounding	grounds	393.9601140952226
13819. i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the	house to the pool	646.1529443135536
13820. two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen	i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the	pool on my left	4075.5107724320815
13821. at the pool's far end was the little cabana joyce	had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender	patches of limp-looking lather	2460.147060110983
13822. a few yards beyond the group of men	a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra	3270.595613463246
13823. lieutenant rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted	me and said hi shell and walked toward me	1253.3830165808813
13824. how'd you	hear about this one	65.68514109053224
13825. i grinned but ignored the question	43.73110852586122
13826. he didn't	push it; rawlins worked out of central homicide and we'd	been friends for years	1877.7960042684851
13827. a call to the police	had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine pm	and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that-	10 minutes ago now	3688.02825371059
13828. present at the scene- in addition to the dead	man who was indeed louis thor- had been thor's partner bill	blake and antony rose an advertising agency executive who handled	the zing account	5302.649755882572
13829. neither of them i understood had been present	at the filming session earlier	790.5539635361494
13830. what were they doing here	22.382361257887435
13831. i asked rawlins	0.20041515
13832. they were supposed to meet thor	at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their	soap a new angle based on this sx-21 stuff	4295.550567328466
13833. yeah	i've heard more about sx-21 than space exploration lately	376.32774071090336
13834. what is the gunk	4.439603374094281
13835. how would i know	2.962337103120379
13836. it's a secret	0.30041514999999996
13837. that was the new advertising angle- something about a lloyd's	of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient	2030.6222143276245
13838. actually	only two men know what the formula is blake and- he	stopped and looked at thor's body	2361.850454547774
13839. i said ok	so now only blake knows	168.34169440238844
13840. how's it strike you foul or fair	140.70906715205683
13841. can't say yet	0.20041515
13842. deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked	in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em	2836.277194069286
13843. the pm	might show he drowned instead but that's what the once-over-lightly	gives us	944.4689569296427
13844. accident murder suicide- take your pick	64.66546878115838
13845. anything else	0.20041515
13846. according to rose	he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in	the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started	hauling him out	4831.292938230028
13847. too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education	is to help you make a living; this is not so for education offers	all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's	eyes while you are having an affair with his wife	4888.983422117821
13848. if it were	not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have	been stymied on what to do and now i understand why they are classics;	those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick	6543.955813017956
13849. i worked for my uncle	who ran one of those antique	shops in new orleans' vieux carre the old french quarter	2038.6962998823292
13850. the	arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day	1192.5214585334738
13851. the rest	of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young	and healthy man just out of college finds interesting	2605.0628419761806
13852. i had	a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with	flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun	3054.567764257018
13853. i had	come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly	because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted	art colony there	3117.8182141804086
13854. when my uncle offered me a part-time job which	would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted	3695.294312139701
13855. the arrangement turned out to be excellent	93.14740751369764
13856. i loved the	city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras	1651.8075645449528
13857. i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide	joyous celebration with romance in the air; and when you took a walk	you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting	around the next corner	4453.6684818418125
13858. the very faces of the people bore this expectation	of fun and pleasure	1179.6851961695745
13859. it was as if they could hardly wait to get	into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring	2034.8855102152738
13860. my uncle and i were not too close socially because	of the difference in our ages	1873.1361500929647
13861. sometimes i wondered vaguely what he	did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither	of us said anything	2600.0088086098294
13862. one monday morning i saw him approach the	store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt	3053.467274023719
13863. they were	married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could	not have been even thirty	1736.918972116699
13864. she looked more like twenty-five or six	142.01722574466066
13865. it was really a may and december combination	167.5961414709959
13866. my new aunt	was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long	time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex	4844.2459011997535
13867. there was	something about the contour of her face her smile that was like new	orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked- there	was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me	4013.307231376702
13868. her legs	were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as	tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect	4305.297511372222
13869. you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her	physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical	body	2728.7105337179332
13870. the true artist is like one of those scientists who from	a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body	2841.4894383262335
13871. the artist looks	at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes	drop away and he sees her as she really is	2879.2298104257907
13872. and that is the way i	first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store	2354.4635367580604
13873. that she impressed me instantly was obvious; i was aware that when	our eyes met we both quickly averted them	1873.3067566169889
13874. i thought i saw a faint	surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks	2343.4261888873625
13875. true	she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage	but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i	did not know or much care	3758.8037170175185
13876. she was standing with her back to	the glass door	558.9850015775908
13877. her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i	could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone	else would have admired	2996.0942836869617
13878. as it is in so many affairs of the heart a	man and a woman meet and something clicks	2604.7862218483942
13879. something clicked in this	instance but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew	it for we both kept our distance	2311.6679611421687
13880. when she appeared at the store	to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious	lest my uncle notice it	3885.5628222406003
13881. and then i became aware that she too	glanced at me surreptitiously	642.8744003668836
13882. i felt that her eyes were undressing me	as if she were a painter and i a nude model	2588.884571260609
13883. i dismissed these feelings	as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that	we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared	to dwell on it because of our relationship	4122.155622767382
13884. when our eyes met the air	was filled with an unuttered message of me too	1644.5873746386574
13885. you have probably	experienced this	14.723396307024723
13886. it is nothing you can put your fingers on but	the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity	2833.6897813038786
13887. why	she married him i do not know	168.0580981031993
13888. i myself was fond of him but what a	young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me	3259.7628818879994
13889. he already	had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had	all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living	2714.461377742497
13890. perhaps with	my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed;	or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father; some women with	father fixations do	5025.421996272267
13891. for several weeks we eyed one another	almost like sparring partners and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed	and stayed home; his bride opened the store	2865.7438603549704
13892. i was waiting	in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle's indisposition	2338.2380303831733
13893. even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away	flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and	subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did	not switch on the lights	4374.124826471298
13894. the cavernous depth cluttered with antiques	echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the	rear and took the seat at his desk	4461.63474302145
13895. she placed her palms fingers	outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next	1876.4055574170059
13896. i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me	the time was opportune	2100.1988694511388
13897. there was little likelihood of any customers	walking in at that hour	636.7471623530863
13898. i was standing beside her watching the outspread	palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall	on which he sometimes napped	3694.336884472303
13899. i bent and kissed the still pink	neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in	a bear-like crush	2317.910059673418
13900. her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts	was warm and moist and tender	1883.0234384001549
13901. i heard her murmur we'd better	lock the door	261.7831620402899
13902. it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely	and return to the rear and its couch	2578.005654466124
13903. when we opened the	door again for business and switched on the lights she said:	he will not always be indisposed	2034.7022623457615
13904. i was thinking	about that	22.22450276066076
13905. how will we work it out	43.30781908200472
13906. i don't	know she said	22.19027999887045
13907. you figure it out	2.9330960119532956
13908. i've	noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met	1172.9093218361481
13909. i guess we both felt it	43.388091971433774
13910. i guess so	she said	22.19027999887045
13911. but now what	0.20041515
13912. even as i said it i	realized that an education can be invaluable	1179.7341693116346
13913. i know what	we can do i said	167.71426626220472
13914. tell him i made a pass at you	252.71283786403305
13915. she	raised a protesting hand with a startled air	260.96713927572574
13916. what are	you trying to do	65.34254925043348
13917. get thrown out	0.20041515
13918. if i even hint at it do you think	it will matter that you are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew	3498.087675835027
13919. i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think	i will	786.9207485915286
13920. i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting	us	1646.3205559735065
13921. by telling him you are making passes at me	262.0685907817227
13922. she said incredulously	0.30041514999999996
13923. when i was in college i	grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class	1730.4483677616972
13924. i don't	even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century	poets	2357.7152117076403
13925. in those days poems often told a story in verse and those	boys had some corkers to tell; and now i think we can use the knowledge	they passed on to us	3445.424806387969
13926. tomorrow mardi gras opens officially	22.1823586362138
13927. a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having	a ball	1257.7420411623575
13928. there will be romance and flirtation	65.48008241996487
13929. if you tell him i	made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said	or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to	date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse	i really am	5122.352491168502
13930. we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street	near lake ponchartrain	1410.9518652789513
13931. and to prove what you tell him about	me you suggest that he keep the date instead	1415.7150230188927
13932. you are both the same size	65.22029862122149
13933. he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask	1105.5500495935075
13934. when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him	about it	2361.155813263312
13935. don't	worry about me	2.9297641017805476
13936. it will turn out all right	64.80077299763427
13937. i don't understand	she insisted	14.844164048233704
13938. are you trying to cut your throat	139.93893494049368
13939. no i chuckled i'm just beginning to collect dividends	on my investment in education	938.2989628089197
13940. as we expected on	the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store	as usual at 10 in the morning	3499.984175763723
13941. i felt that he looked at me coldly	and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards	me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that	he had been told of advances to his wife	4367.42462596027
13942. i quit work at my usual	hour as if this day was no different from other days	2122.2825717068654
13943. i heard subsequently	that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in	the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume	to keep the date	3457.4960225935342
13944. shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street	facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from	the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view	5802.469568356805
13945. a few minutes later i saw my uncle's car drive up and a woman's	figure emerge and walk to the corner	2045.0190179943625
13946. i must say the figure was	well made up	391.86921032336966
13947. if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken	it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him	2583.0504334999346
13948. in one hand he	gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain	1888.912940520133
13949. i suspected why he brought it along	94.0995950546243
13950. in the half darkness i	approached cautiously making sure he did not see me	1412.3271421350541
13951. he was looking	out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without	wasting words i smacked him hard across the face	2857.318345123757
13952. you cheap	bitch! i exclaimed	22.177504628510743
13953. you cheap no good two-timing bitch!	you get a good loyal husband- smack!- and you fall for a pass	by his own nephew! you should- smack!- be ashamed of yourself	3239.894795154704
13954. he had better write a postcard to walter	251.44747017994783
13955. he opened the myth book again	and there	were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilder's address	1722.557514241947
13956. the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black	book kept in a nearly secret drawer	2832.855941812156
13957. the code which had probably	something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined	to find out and put to use	2469.409959896332
13958. a card to walter would get him an introduction	to this meredith and that might be good for something	2586.705213225735
13959. nicolas	called on his muse a line came back:   squaresville	man and all the palazzos are crummy palasts	1571.830388000039
13960. that	ought	to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the	wax tape that was his mind	3285.430808125771
13961. and indeed his postcard did draw	from walter a letter recommending his friend the poet nicolas manas	to his friend meredith wilder	2188.1513422731277
13962. five days later on receiving it	meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table	1635.157933087355
13963. his hand was large and square and heavily tanned	261.3818187566807
13964. the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt	561.6410266832826
13965. his four weeks	in italy had turned into nearer three months	502.0474930555439
13966. he had returned to the	pension a week ago	393.4370414957875
13967. now he was just in the late poems of ho^lderlin	and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus	next semester's class preparation	2615.865734050137
13968. he was determined to spend an	industrious summer	250.23270838609764
13969. well maybe manas wouldn't call	14.84216646385418
13970. meredith's	fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him: sie la^cheln	die schwarzen hexen	1656.1999167922324
13971. the menace of manas gradually faded	as meredith asked himself should he translate it 'how the dark	fates laughed'	1730.6713904492103
13972. or more rhythmically 'the swarthy witches are	laughing'	250.43033200441732
13973. and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might	be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas	1873.536218420018
13974. but	nicolas too was being interrupted that morning	248.63751084824557
13975. not by the	11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the	english gardens and sent him off to sleep; but by a blond girl in	a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded	him	4625.5301300863375
13976. should she wake him	4.442869439192954
13977. she didn't have the heart	14.827280840434174
13978. her heart	her maternal feeling in fact her h her being was too busy expressing	itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep	under a blanket in a park like a scene from poussin	6061.166806685064
13979. she was just	not able to break the spell	260.3774609138293
13980. known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had	found his first night in one of walter's marked bars	3273.4446715858967
13981. nicolas:	look nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys- no sex see	645.031177576054
13982. so	if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot	of money	2580.43839800941
13983. ballet dancer: protests tears and take what you	want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful	2179.464635139563
13984. to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied ok i can	use this blanket	1179.76319447376
13985. and when you get off this job tonight well you	can gimme something to eat	1099.418559149559
13986. and as a matter of fact nicolas had	slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that munich's	early mornings even in summer are laden with dew	5002.273057645745
13987. he had always	known how to find a bed and on his own terms	939.8227748141775
13988. he used the blanket	for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs	and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few	her nicolas lay	curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes	7124.540335068326
13989. she	was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of	a long meaningful search for truth	2022.9815069208012
13990. this was surely a reunion in art	it was all that poetry promised	1172.3963483661096
13991. that long night with nicolas	and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes	787.7849467413532
13992. his advice his voice	saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her-	on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his	hair- this was all new	5936.937313852483
13993. her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse	of a new faith	789.6262729957787
13994. the next day he was gone	64.69944738260271
13995. mary jane	might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most	determined	1412.9181952999083
13996. even so it took her several days to force walter to tell	her nicolas's whereabouts	1634.0668304280405
13997. packing a small suitcase informing	her husband whom she found in harry's bar that she was taking a train	to germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a	drink getting on the train- all this had only taken her two hours	4598.22554896747
13998. she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens	965.0660402175836
13999. dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he	is sleeping in the english gardens	1412.8052534820595
14000. how like him! mary	jane had smilingly said	251.32170482567298
14001. his address walter added is that	great foundling home the american express	640.4100587031955
14002. and i will greatly	appreciate it if you will not tell your husband h	1412.2433008409027
14003. for the last	half hour mary jane had criss-crossed half the length of the gardens	and at last come upon her knight	2176.3166014408903
14004. his presence there asleep in	the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power	to teach her: freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning	of nature how to live simply with the angels	6434.93626777849
14005. she set	down her suitcase	14.778390146814937
14006. should she wake him	4.442869439192954
14007. no	0.20041515
14008. smiling she sat down	on the suitcase and waited and watched	758.0031339533302
14009. the sun grew hotter	as it approached the midday	262.1300344271409
14010. nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed	against the dashboard of a speeding car	1650.9549343720362
14011. in	his dream he cried slow down for chrissake! he half woke	and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass	2175.7489830871673
14012. he blew his nose expertly between his fingers	248.19094258296735
14013. he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then	more vigorously between his legs	1728.3630500688093
14014. mary jane got up quietly and walked away	250.0964573393177
14015. twenty minutes	later she was at the desk of the gra^fin's pension her tears	dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath	2466.453939103115
14016. mary jane	belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions	in all the major and minor cities	2824.9313734258276
14017. she had retreated to this world	43.41769669216206
14018. the gra^fin who was charmed by her told her your sister who	was here two years ago has quite dark hair	3032.153097932846
14019. nevertheless there is no bath	14.85898017290549
14020. but a young american	has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it	this once	3485.054210502166
14021. and then we shall see h	43.91553123791705
14022. meredith was irritated when the gra^fin	knocked at his door and told him she is a great beauty!	shall we allow her not to have a bath	4282.640719814417
14023. actually she is a sad beauty	i believe	168.02774661381576
14024. you shall see her at dinner	64.51098778730065
14025. rather erotically	he listened to the bath water running; when it stopped he began busily	typing sitting up in a virtuous way	2172.2372148808295
14026. before dinner he shaved for	the second time that day	557.3332431238027
14027. a thing he did not like doing generally	167.36457743921804
14028. singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note	when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part	of his italian sun tan	5170.6922061362175
14029. he flexed his muscles for several minutes	got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed	1885.8584940345925
14030. in the small gallery used as the guests' dining room meredith	sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young	waitress	3731.5264124769105
14031. he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his	sheets when he saw the gra^fin followed	by a stately blond girl approaching his table	3111.397484918606
14032. it would be literary	license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin	so startled was he by mary jane's beauty	3890.972732852915
14033. yet he did drop	his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the	gra^fin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special	2733.645224308266
14034. mary jane had made very little effort	141.52415544900478
14035. above a dark green skirt	she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no	brassiere	beneath	1892.4022557431988
14036. her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight	down to her shoulders	1407.9563181495464
14037. perhaps her eyes were larger and more of	a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day	1874.793738673053
14038. she had touched	her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which	made her lips glisten but no redder than usual	4101.858857891373
14039. the result was grace	and modesty	43.88730863137008
14040. as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank	you for the use of your bath- when she sat down opposite him-	spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence	and control	5750.69806609268
14041. meredith began falling in love	14.875783532759595
14042. soup: only	this	morning; veal cutlets: oh i couldn't possibly eat all	this!; wine: then you were typing poems this afternoon	3040.74276436141
14043. ;	fruit compote: if you think i would understand it;	a smile	264.0311168320651
14044. like h as if it were	built of books	388.6180249390825
14045. having opened the windows onto the terrace	lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down	a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin	2994.1586468203404
14046. opening these	he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses	hidden inside it	1877.873519975036
14047. i think the maids tipple in the afternoon	165.23311730777135
14048. those sweet girls	0.30041514999999996
14049. oh h you're joking	2.9370181409453155
14050. it tastes	a little like poppyseed	65.06452785918022
14051. what's its name	0.20041515
14052. steinha^ger h	she whispered steinha^ger to herself several times memorizing	it	743.7694599467716
14053. would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me	read it to myself	1407.399251219679
14054. meredith's voice was always deep with rough	bass notes in it; in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium	of the ymha poetry center nights his voice	was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy	5605.533548914376
14055. his new poem a love poem	told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when	the lights in the house have failed	2740.161270144431
14056. the husband points the steps	out with his flashlight: its white stare filling her pale eyes	to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my	thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak	all night	but he read on	7229.268559358541
14057. in the bedroom	before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go	on: in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face still	blind start wincing in obedience to dirty waters counters pots	and pans waiting below stairs in her mind	4680.917955390025
14058. mary jane took the	page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words	2124.1510418385833
14059. oh it's that myth about orpheus and h what is her name	645.004077338029
14060. i can never pronounce it	22.058593036502725
14061. the	third time rather urgently	14.765633220847224
14062. but with her hand poem again	65.02547336997675
14063. she raised	her face and nodded it's sweet and very sad	504.33309079021484
14064. they discussed	the way people never tell each other the things on their minds	1410.3909589634172
14065. they	finished the small bottle of steinha^ger	93.4623234868097
14066. she confessed she	was unhappy he asked was it her husband	746.2189537047121
14067. she began to explain there	was this poet in italy h he interrupted please don't	judge all poets	1567.18222062251
14068. at her door two or three	hours later mary jane whispered everyone is asleep	1417.1080031012443
14069. kissing	her he whispered several times eurydice	93.20470421283481
14070. the third time	rather urgently	22.133156694420567
14071. but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment	she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his	bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of	her hand against his mouth	4373.021436950519
14072. they were west of the sabine but only god knew where	755.9800682202793
14073. for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley	as flat and featureless as a dead sea	1900.107969470957
14074. molten glare singed their	eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and	strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay	like acid in their lungs	4853.168953686881
14075. and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead	scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into	the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze	2847.5353221728683
14076. ben prime extended	his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the	noses of the oxen	2345.660762471768
14077. hoa-whup! he commanded from his raw throat	and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips	1724.2852444501332
14078. he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through	the dust film upon his gaunt face	2593.1707576891904
14079. the dust-thick saliva came	from his mouth like balled cotton	379.64190886793153
14080. he moved back to the wheel and	stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling	of his played-out limbs	3673.44462541735
14081. the burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes	in salt-edged patches	377.1235651632665
14082. he cleared his throat and wet his	lips	250.160930674065
14083. as cheerfully as possible he said well i guess we could	all do with a little drink	1415.0722256174274
14084. he unlashed the dipper and drew	water from a barrel	565.8078771186089
14085. they could no longer afford the luxury of the	canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation	1417.4857122727603
14086. the water was warm and	stale and had a brackish taste	756.578397186394
14087. thank the lord	they still had water!   he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity	1097.6348861717609
14088. he took a long but carefully controlled draught	250.59748768063952
14089. he replenished	the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck	1099.3251854333694
14090. she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his	966.4805314074845
14091. she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and	wipe her face	1250.5706939118686
14092. she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving	it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully	3471.0615253080227
14093. what happens when there's no more water	93.89303706502874
14094. she asked smolderingly	0.30041514999999996
14095. she was like charcoal he thought- dark opaque explosive	260.76624458768595
14096. her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal	557.820548885144
14097. her temper	sparked like charcoal when it first lights up	373.5486030771853
14098. and all the time she	had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its	under side but not visibly	3667.2794918152695
14099. a ripple ran through the muscles	of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice	1253.5490537647897
14100. there must	be some water under there	140.64825793677596
14101. he tilted his homely face toward the	dry bed of the river	644.5682681676969
14102. we can get it if we dig he said patiently	560.2669548039703
14103. and add fever to our troubles	43.29950602535506
14104. she scoffed	0.30041514999999996
14105. or	do you want to see if i can stand fever too	640.4393871187935
14106. we can	boil it he said	64.85087768120547
14107. we're lost and	burning up already she bit out tensely	370.7999279457545
14108. the tires are rattling	on the wheels now	251.18466310414973
14109. they'll roll off in another day	43.240284232091184
14110. there was no	valley like this on your map	390.6878925876761
14111. you don't even know where we're headed	93.42397212953969
14112. hettie he said as gently as he could we're	still headed west	963.2698621337701
14113. somewhere we'll hit a trail	14.927886508275279
14114. maybe in time to make a cross and	dig our graves	754.6715898044652
14115. in a way he couldn't	blame her	94.06161013930804
14116. he had picked out this pathless trail instead of	the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on	their honeymoon	3878.4948425553216
14117. it had been a mistake but anything would have	been a mistake as it turned out	1257.090239515216
14118. it wasn't the roughness and crudity	and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her	1649.0199017885527
14119. she had hated	the whole idea before they started	260.0206074803897
14120. actually she had hated him before	she ever saw him	562.4747280253458
14121. it had been five days too late before he learned	that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of	laudanum administered by her mother	2716.3690038979776
14122. the bitterness of their	wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound	1422.3067319718234
14123. she had jumped	away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder	1101.1293633885407
14124. he	had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time	961.1089746812252
14125. but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper	380.1039512016075
14126. he stared	at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands	1641.855178699348
14127. i suppose he muttered i can sell the outfit for enough	to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement	2316.680683929107
14128. don't try to be noble! her laugh was hard	388.8149718209495
14129. they	wouldn't	have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to	go around	1416.1977178808377
14130. hettie they didn't sell you	he said miserably	250.01824815417217
14131. they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back	in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our	own	2596.123446371665
14132. they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where	nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's	inside of them	4984.330957148389
14133. without money or property what would you have	had at baton rouge	646.8182838183127
14134. i might have starved but at least	i wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt!	he darkened under his heavy burn	3680.4248653275085
14135. his blue eyes sought the shimmering	sea of haze ahead	371.4109038927878
14136. to his puzzlement there suddenly was	no	haze	247.883683618818
14137. the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed	line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty	miles ahead	2721.6413035436176
14138. then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy	ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests	of the surrounding hills	3882.522007071093
14139. he had never seen clouds like them before	but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before	a hurricane in carolina	2602.5279908588573
14140. he hollered hoarsely hang on!	and goaded the oxen as he yelled	969.2371117395305
14141. he wanted to turn them putting	the wagon against the storm	501.2269017341412
14142. too late he realized that in turning	he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a	grade or ridge	3697.9641370313607
14143. he swung up over the wheel	43.71622009174429
14144. you had better	get inside he warned her	249.02221565584927
14145. but she sat on in stubborn silence	93.94533587313455
14146. the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great	black funnel	965.1475621529831
14147. frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley	gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving	hound dog cracking marrowbones	2602.1878312369277
14148. the six-ton conestoga began to whip	and shake	250.41030359632788
14149. it was filled with dust	and wind and sound and violence	507.3675084528821
14150. the heavens opened pelting them with	hail the size of walnuts	751.7645358540603
14151. and then came the water- not rain but	solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket	1737.0921135145666
14152. walls	of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests	of flash floods	2134.917816438346
14153. through the splash of the rising waters they could	hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing	big chunks out of the banks	2975.5926854287127
14154. the jetting frothing surface of	the river reached the level of the runoff	1180.6859784614091
14155. the dangerous current upon	the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising	1099.1230275620992
14156. they cringed	under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom	1190.4206447990305
14157. the cloudburst cut off abruptly	14.812189200465998
14158. they were engulfed by	the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river	2118.3607482615635
14159. then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright	sunlight	792.022929009013
14160. beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they	crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water	that reached clear to the surrounding hills	4997.628588568632
14161. the water level was	higher than their hubs	167.10351704634712
14162. only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored	563.1015127231057
14163. there was no real sign of the river now just a roiling	oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere	2303.472395857689
14164. clumps of brush rode down the ribbon	141.46809457845413
14165. now and then the glistening	side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past	1100.8575774721699
14166. the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging	her shoulders and still trembling	2114.3031292591727
14167. her face was pale but set and	her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben	1101.2034838954125
14168. out of compulsion	to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky	to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit	3677.695899701819
14169. at least the wheels	dug in	43.57140390485062
14170. the soaking will put life back in the wagon too	564.666273172736
14171. his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard	167.61834527966795
14172. she was watching a	tree ride wildly down that roiling current	753.7311509965256
14173. somebody was riding the	tree	14.966927543006339
14174. it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting	astride an upright branch	2131.095690397455
14175. she did not call out	14.703671734009186
14176. but as	the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell	1878.5777078696708
14177. they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend	500.6555606146886
14178. it speared	up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned	slowly	1426.0662324602968
14179. the pale blob of the woman disappeared	94.24799126691761
14180. there's	the one who's lucky! the girl murmured harshly	395.0062857745349
14181. ben's	eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray	and crimson	1098.9478275163624
14182. then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into	the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they	needed his	4108.209771535809
14183. it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of	the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man	2322.0706701636345
14184. he let	down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water	1411.6694867346064
14185. he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of	seed grain forward	1407.5059252113795
14186. they were already swollen to bursting	64.85914761171253
14187. of all	their worldly	belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been	the most treasured	1890.39982642732
14188. it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour	and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry	it	4280.968724096679
14189. the oxen might as well enjoy it	94.10899509927688
14190. he examined the water marks	on the iron tires when the animals were finished	1409.853842575449
14191. the waters lay	muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there	was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding	2843.2191838526933
14192. he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills	that rimmed the valley	2368.5178403753043
14193. a terrible numbing sense of futility swept	over him	261.8892047595767
14194. he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of	defeat	746.0252842905272
14195. then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen	642.859874376543
14196. the spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels	as if of one piece	2129.9051261081395
14197. he swung toward	the front	to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by	the vehemence of her blame and hate	2460.1494810497525
14198. a tight	wagon meant so much	65.18416838810619
14199. he got a small fire started and put on bacon	and coffee	639.4773143006894
14200. he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour	salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort	3055.90817148425
14201. their	jams and jellies had not suffered	93.89108211233172
14202. he found a jar of preserved tomatoes	and one of eggs that they had meant to save	2109.3560215800344
14203. now he broke them open	hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie	1093.7367602959894
14204. his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating	java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time	3889.3647401076314
14205. he	furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and	wagon open	1103.0477385704035
14206. he looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding	her meager treasures	752.4217364270997
14207. he said hesitantly hettie i don't	figure your things got wet too much	786.2095091642207
14208. if you	want to get them aired h   she said without turning her head	after that rain beating in atop the dust there isn't a thing	that won't be streaked	4816.148846089998
14209. he drew a long breath and opened	the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs	1878.6504683671526
14210. sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams	of	1170.0695082764998
14211. i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold	and touched off the blaze	1425.1052368927462
14212. now roaring up in great oily clouds of	smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where	we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do h	5164.6599230080255
14213. the lifeboats were stuck fast	14.76425393303999
14214. i heard a	cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued	the man's bare back	3305.756761799671
14215. he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard	into the shark-infested waters	647.4763856560187
14216. one especially bad detonation	shook lifeboat no 3 which trembled violently in the davits	1414.2391621111824
14217. brassnose	yelled: come on sommers max h step on it we got	a chance now	1100.5076132686986
14218. heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck	249.75469884573778
14219. we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until	they bled profusely	1090.1956320565255
14220. the bonaventure was quivering and lurching	like an old spavined mare	758.078606035
14221. her stern was down and a sharp list helped	us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water	2037.6427165148184
14222. brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the	boat	1190.1439836047443
14223. let's get away fast said brassnose shaking water from	his mop of bleached hair	938.5192827680401
14224. that tub is going to explode all at once	388.40060131679104
14225. then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a	roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of	black-and-orange smoke	2458.351703858169
14226. dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal	agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno	2351.282809566035
14227. already our	leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water	499.6710919757411
14228. sommers you	bale while we row brassnose commanded	250.30807906881438
14229. as best as i could	determine we were some 700 miles west of new guinea in the bismark	archipelago	1726.7090672010727
14230. three days previously we had steamed past barren	rennell island in the distance	1196.040441715972
14231. now we peered anxiously for any speck	of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have	to stop soon	2019.284491155257
14232. there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands;	our muscles were hot wires of pain	2107.1548502962482
14233. the big man with the whitened hair murmured something: his	words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue which i recognized	having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 class at the	university of chicago	3957.1819984178037
14234. he then said something which struck	a chord in my memory	754.068032666397
14235. god help us if we're near the island	of eromonga	375.25945978536635
14236. we'd be in real trouble then	65.01945864562597
14237. i'd rather keep bailing-	or sink	43.42085846822171
14238. i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled	the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a	university lecture on primitive societies	4097.975283255661
14239. he had been speaking of this	archipelago:   even when the islands were under german	mandate before world war 1 europeans gave eromonga a wide berth	2598.200008944072
14240. the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are	anachronisms of the twentieth century- stone age amazons who live	in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient	4644.929032301831
14241. i remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate bobby pauson:	but how do they reproduce dr griggs	1571.0086693409037
14242. i'm sure that	males have something to do with that process!   there had	been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as professor griggs said	dryly: i see your point pauson	4652.914411959304
14243. of course males play a role	there but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one	bit on eromonga	2039.8101551413079
14244. indeed you wouldn't live long for the females	either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back	to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy	them by revolting but ingenious methods	5787.647985584916
14245. in fact one important	aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men	943.7122285500058
14246. i	think i know what you mean brassnose i said	561.7959990549058
14247. i know something	about eromonga	15.012378901455998
14248. let's hope we come to a safer place	250.81019555589873
14249. three hours later while we were bailing desperately	a dot of land came into view	1091.9014516942113
14250. foster lukuklu frayne made a	sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs: i recognized it as	an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil	4298.475226863129
14251. a	half-hour passed; we had drifted closer	94.26959971483613
14252. in a voice so frightened as	to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered:   tchalo!	it is eromonga- look hard you can see with your	naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff	5663.4824887192535
14253. i squinted	at the looming shoreline	43.497313961383995
14254. there was a wooden tower or derrick there	something like a ski jump; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had	been artfully constructed of logs	4094.0170203172565
14255. a fine example of engineering in	a primitive society	261.2560221350826
14256. what is the scaffolding for brassnose	65.15421151945637
14257. he made a sound of despair deep in his throat	373.18673482038696
14258. it was	embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like	a child who talks about bogeymen	2114.9591585375733
14259. aaa-ee! it is their	tultul the 'jumping platform' of death	373.71232182074493
14260. it is the last of the	three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male	in worthy of survival there	3671.17161083861
14261. often i heard my uncles and cousins speak	of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul	1864.909388341496
14262. they had never	seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers	1652.8385359105282
14263. our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had	heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and	graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon	into the open sea and toward our craft	4553.7050414761925
14264. i expected brassnose-	as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood- to speak to	them	2351.4332467816457
14265. but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked	649.7287588484155
14266. so i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and	said we greet you in peace	2129.895524397738
14267. my friends and i	come from a ship which was destroyed by fire	786.9078242247226
14268. we are thirsty and hungry;	our sore and burned hands and arms need attention	1408.0117518194818
14269. the	girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me	1266.8076645466874
14270. i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland	of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair	3252.669167526774
14271. she said my	name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen	796.9104338965409
14272. you are welcome	to eromonga	22.30450598122368
14273. my people await you on the shore	94.58886302392973
14274. you shall have	food water and rest	140.39207113870913
14275. thirty minutes later the outrigger grated	on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull	it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder	3652.3473982618802
14276. i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there	564.427444293003
14277. all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished	at the sight	1260.529589131535
14278. there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls	at the base of the big wooden derrick	2349.647465308316
14279. some had been there for years;	others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them	1407.3361194157
14280. there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me	389.5680469348987
14281. this	was also a corpse- a male judging from the coral arm bands the	tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of	the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose	4055.640803345768
14282. the body may have been two or three weeks' dead	560.5017659460127
14283. i looked	with revulsion at the legs	94.49480522882178
14284. many small bones protruded	crazily from the shreds of flesh	565.5733041975932
14285. the man must have leaped to	his death from the topmost rung of the tultul	1100.7863530725115
14286. as if divining	my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual	tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden:	this is our tultul a jumping platform maku	5489.934941186879
14287. later	you shall know it better	43.3704273517382
14288. is it not well-made	4.4347628477795915
14289. our old one blew	down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons	ago	1575.6567725434127
14290. it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one	which is higher and stronger than the old one	3266.8424766464263
14291. we are very proud of	it	43.285326481403665
14292. you have every right to be i replied gravely in	the manu dialect but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest	and strongest of us	4082.673541243482
14293. he looked as if he was going to keel over	374.4701823677368
14294. i	felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these	girls that we were afraid	2827.9172053251373
14295. i clapped	the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily	hoping it would make an impression on the women: this one is the	maku frayne	3242.140081290236
14296. he speaks your language too for he is the grandson	of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning	3691.8570232441625
14297. the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather	374.4199498685085
14298. this was the worst thing i could have said	392.3441120763797
14299. brassnose	turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly sommers you	meddling yank you're a fool! they despise males who brag of	their strength; they destroy such men with their damned tests	3530.78247178368
14300. you've	ruined me blast you!   at first i thought he was out	of his head talking wildly like this	2590.5243944081303
14301. but a glance at songau and	the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out	1098.0673352302042
14302. the	women's faces had hardened after my statement	250.07591522395668
14303. at a nod from songau	four lithe and muscular girls darted to frayne's side and seized	him by the arms	1879.9559918777395
14304. the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle;	but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest	male that ever lived	4496.6946496033415
14305. besides terror had sapped some of frayne's	vitality and will	374.9600378144024
14306. my last impression as they led him off to	a stockade was of his pale face   in the manu tongue eromonga	means manhood- a quality which the women derisively toasted	in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were	imbibed	6796.988739971549
14307. in the hut to which i was assigned- max had his own quarters-	my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping	breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases	3932.1999756298
14308. her name was l'turu and she told me many things	560.0579005333716
14309. for	an anthropologist loquacious old l'turu was a mine of information	500.7861426941837
14310. though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never	leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its	women	4472.989813860402
14311. from l'turu	i heard that until about 1850 the people of this island- which	was about the size of guam or smaller- had been of both sexes	and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here	with minor variations	4379.467635695786
14312. but in the middle of the last century	an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an	inter-tribal	battle and rallied the women after their men had fled	5205.782535555498
14313. miraculously	karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders	from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable	loss of life on both sides	3218.8458381573255
14314. karipo was something of a	politician as well as a militarist	761.347611375579
14315. she quickly exploited the exalted	position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even	putting many of them to death	2174.1414838244077
14316. within a decade or less few men	were left and a feminist society had sprung up	1882.4979952855847
14317. karipo was	great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to	father children the crone told me	1864.0913628408302
14318. all men went away from here	65.56821675925994
14319. those who stayed had to pass tests	93.86951407924248
14320. she cackled with	mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth	564.2394186051968
14321. karipo's women	then named this place 'eromonga'- manhood- for just the strongest	men could stay here	1263.638234340431
14322. the old woman	arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood	1882.701209145222
14323. in	the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four	figures in a semi-circle on the ground	2331.4753811846795
14324. i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized	then headed for home	1402.5891847637558
14325. maybe to beat up on his squaw	93.68068792073797
14326. benson looked	up and saw ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the	stiff edge of the overall bib	3276.1939500760354
14327. ramey reached out with the tire iron	and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack	2023.901725305535
14328. i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't	understand the liquor or automobiles	2131.282557998101
14329. somehow the thought of a simple	man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand	moved the driver	2039.1907600571772
14330. for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless	drivers softened	757.4084343114293
14331. maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault	ramey thought	371.2927069226882
14332. maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any	of us	1413.1600551732233
14333. anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be	stared at	938.2526393273922
14334. ever see yourself spread out on the pavement benny	392.02929017386896
14335. he said to his partner	14.777802754430969
14336. you mean dream	0.30041514999999996
14337. not exactly	0.20041515
14338. benson grinned and flipped a rock	with his thumb like a marble	968.4190348338255
14339. nope just you all the time-	sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent	partner	1725.6877729255204
14340. ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always	see me too	956.8808711017382
14341. whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt	ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out	thoughts in his own mind	2738.8432685625457
14342. then he would realize they were really things	that only he himself could think	1403.2517152938426
14343. with this realization sometimes	he saw himself as he looked down	505.77834070997415
14344. you seen him yet	4.401745872580731
14345. benson said referring to the indian	43.4526196097349
14346. he wasn't in the	car ramey said	140.78398270671315
14347. you didn't go clear around benson	said	93.6816276324564
14348. if you want to see something he's back on the other	side by the trunk of the car	2369.515492087468
14349. too long a waiting line	ramey answered pretending to joke	372.56972956863336
14350. a few minutes later the	insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license	plates on it from a far-away state	3903.5833723497817
14351. it was a trick they used to try	and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their	speed	1871.3436874760123
14352. sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar	on the trucks as they passed	2589.688971551447
14353. all the drivers knew about the plates	and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges	the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping	cane	3660.4073128904156
14354. horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to	look like a tourist	1899.7443173633496
14355. it had always seemed strange to ramey that to	disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would	merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head	3224.2296486238183
14356. the insurance	man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all	right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they	towed the rig back to town	5141.090017548814
14357. he chatted with ramey and benson for a	minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer	1571.2021106087936
14358. every so often the	diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for	the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear	4500.294287802748
14359. when they	were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of	the trailer	1414.092893090408
14360. there's a body you won't mind looking at	benson said and they stopped	1183.598023186915
14361. she had driven up with her husband	in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers	knew nothing at the moment about that	2591.137459975462
14362. she wore shorts and a loose	terry-cloth shirt	251.74837288601688
14363. slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn	straight back simply	643.2367493161246
14364. what outfit does she drive for	65.56237188312811
14365. benson said	0.20041515
14366. seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition	392.9654811975906
14367. she might have been someone he had once loved	263.87819436983636
14368. he had never seen	her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson	went in and out of the cities at each end of their run	4978.378109819864
14369. the truck	routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed	briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city	and they could never stay	3221.8068089025533
14370. how would you ever see her again	139.98350297186477
14371. the feeling	subsided it was only a small yearning	262.3606425722609
14372. what's she doing in this bunch	64.77123835508178
14373. benson said and ramey	wondered how close their thoughts might have been	640.0863613164145
14374. the girl	looked around at the countryside	141.7391017505691
14375. her glance swung past the trailer	where the two drivers were standing	642.1802545391474
14376. it made only a tiny bump over	the two	men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on	3048.948108462183
14377. she began	to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear	of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured	slightly	3349.4190616091173
14378. what had caught his attention was obscured by the car	itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but	benson knew what it was	4474.174397761113
14379. the girl took a couple of steps toward the	man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could	never decide was real said you don't want to go around there	ma'am	3545.5110940051404
14380. the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge	that someone had spoken to her	2106.585903005377
14381. the man stood near the bent	levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car	1724.947868958619
14382. the two drivers moved closer	22.29522185180459
14383. what does he want a spoon	43.41846187164078
14384. benson said to ramey	4.394796411286183
14385. one tiny detail in a happening can	clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest	of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain	3111.1288321210964
14386. with ramey it was	a dusty work shoe that was half-off the indian's foot that he would	always remember	2587.5837547712113
14387. the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets	but there was still a bow knot at the top	1873.8793091500233
14388. the slightest twitch would	have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still	inside	2350.0355057538018
14389. the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed	man	501.9812762816829
14390. he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v	at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows	3062.267247247424
14391. he turned and looked	at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes	643.1336045483054
14392. he was very tanned-	big hands might have torn him from a coca-cola poster	1423.362470877002
14393. he's	dead isn't he	2.957538176854027
14394. the man said	0.30041514999999996
14395. he turned and bent over	the body of the indian	375.0988815045438
14396. there was nothing in particular on the man's	face	393.74344725468546
14397. it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine	645.0407457775601
14398. what's this	0.30041514999999996
14399. the man said backing up a step	still looking down	376.70755615330523
14400. his words were mostly to himself	65.08153075574734
14401. there was a gentle concern in benson's voice	167.40306282440423
14402. ramey looked	down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned	leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by	itself on the pavement	4836.145672562829
14403. but what is it	2.934656529649969
14404. the man said	with a tone of impatience	251.11597361224872
14405. but what is it	2.934656529649969
14406. the man had	spoken only once	65.31531519824213
14407. ramey heard the words again inside weakened the	way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure	whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears	3436.6938454041847
14408. the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and ramey's	vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's	leg	3684.0942024293263
14409. ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown	skin	644.9534257983125
14410. he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the	voice of his partner through trees don't do that fella	3253.081986842492
14411. the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought	the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde	head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist	3750.555075138446
14412. ramey swung	and caught the man just to the left of his mouth	1183.7432841867937
14413. it was a straight	solid once-in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles in between	the man's cheekbone and his chin	1886.2525804227512
14414. ramey's fist and the air expelled	from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like	cupped hands clapping together	3498.3218666895314
14415. the man took two short steps	backward then sat down heavily on the pavement	946.7601395134574
14416. ramey heard a cry from	the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand	1887.30230551313
14417. as he watched	the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very	difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet	2855.835484715447
14418. he hadn't	done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard	1640.0163130550202
14419. with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out	in front of him	1417.7419930159667
14420. his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth	was slightly open	1190.2523968555784
14421. after what seemed several seconds the open mouth	grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it	1566.9132802271533
14422. the man brought	one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he	touched his mouth	2586.4485633624713
14423. he moaned and pulled the hand away	93.20543147326451
14424. even yet there	was no realization in his eyes	392.9480096684692
14425. ramey could hear the crowd	coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his	shoulder had no identity or importance to him	2616.9858628852585
14426. he did not look around	22.37772304008114
14427. he's hurt!	a woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from	the man's wife	1581.8441896511279
14428. the man on the ground began to move; one of his	hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him	2818.9238606628946
14429. blood dripped	down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that	ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the	bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color	4239.287667852608
14430. the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back	959.8873127107399
14431. can you hear can you talk to me	167.25186015228036
14432. she begged	0.30041514999999996
14433. an incoherent	puzzled sound came from the red mouth	264.7167739493863
14434. the girl looked around quickly	at several of the people	561.0293380061729
14435. none of the crowd had stepped forward to	help	262.59830953015114
14436. then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment	748.5726687916388
14437. why did you do it- why did you hit him	374.0832767632579
14438. she said	her voice rising	22.227019667973288
14439. a shine in her eyes suddenly	became tears and she turned back to her husband again	1253.9868295431402
14440. behind	ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers	250.58296496717435
14441. no one seemed	to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility	in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver	beyond finding out	3210.6615401998324
14442. ramey looked around and caught sight of his	partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman	3061.6838383835734
14443. benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and	talking rapidly	642.2285519478455
14444. ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man	249.56360673367266
14445. some of	the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey	940.7238796400252
14446. it's	all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk	rapidly down along the trailer toward them	3289.8574653817113
14447. ramey watched him coming	with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer	1742.4007256526024
14448. he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's	swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and	rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on	the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of	his pistol	7872.919995754013
14449. all right step back! the patrolman said	to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball	cap and a young boy in levis	3123.1854032151496
14450. he walked straight up to the man sitting	on the ground and bent over to look at him	2359.38556012612
14451. you all right	0.20041515
14452. mough- it's my mough the man said trying	to talk without moving his lips	1400.7032467209833
14453. his brown face looked gray from dirt	streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across	it	2039.4681299056203
14454. then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the	venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead	on him as the life finally went out of the brute	5830.035493849669
14455. the body continued	to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome	bloody mass out of the bungalow	2453.540474869531
14456. he slammed the door and listened	as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots	2366.9597725777576
14457. he heard	their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered	the snake right on the porch with wood axes	2187.7593963386366
14458. it was only then	that he turned to look at penny	750.1814112692216
14459. she was sitting on the edge	of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found	her	2038.5555907363098
14460. the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some	other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth	4063.82177365925
14461. but her hands were calm now	43.37795727468953
14462. she's got guts thought	keith	22.166777676019883
14463. she's got more guts than any other woman in the world	503.2965222827885
14464. keith said penny keith you were wonderful	139.85935366324833
14465. i	don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving	her life but i am	1562.4272621572916
14466. he smiled at her	sincerity	22.067104613873454
14467. and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her	beauty	781.1964162816134
14468. seven years they'd been married	22.13596814055278
14469. he knew her	mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful	insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost	too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part	3763.321818430879
14470. but her beauty always	surprised him anew	140.8557279926489
14471. i realize that this is hardly the time	to say it penny said keith	937.6805700831683
14472. but knowing you i know that	you're glad to be alive and grateful- and sorry because i killed	the snake even though i had to	3891.7062712072193
14473. isn't that so	0.20041515
14474. penny	lowered her eyes	4.448545784997821
14475. yes she said almost in a whisper	as if admitting to a crime	792.9772718268289
14476. the snake was beautiful wasn't	it	64.76513377518354
14477. asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself	as he struggled to control his growing anger	1567.7671773398984
14478. it was a king	cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life	in the jungle didn't it	3474.431885475471
14479. didn't it	0.20041515
14480. penny	did not answer	4.394934178919147
14481. now she just sat there looking at him without an expression	except concern for him	1097.3043519599307
14482. we're all god's creatures	aren't we	65.11134113828042
14483. keith was snarling now	2.9618483569921383
14484. all of us- every	goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle	1182.1261842964775
14485. you love this village	and these stinking brown people because they're god's creatures	too	943.7288185247486
14486. and you love ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even	a little more because he's a beautiful man	2585.6950277389997
14487. and he loves you because	you're a beautiful woman	261.70012014213455
14488. we're all god's creatures aren't	we penny	140.09961229509977
14489. all of us that is except me	93.41894125469624
14490. you hate me you	hate my guts because i like to hunt	966.2437440184412
14491. you actually hate me- and we	both know it- because i killed that filthy snake	1092.8127056832523
14492. h well why don't	you	say something	141.26248013029482
14493. penny would not rise to his mood	93.5011024162246
14494. there isn't anything left to say is there keith	391.19526672225453
14495. she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side	away from the door where she slept better because keith was between	her and the invader	2978.63317108677
14496. he knew she was not sulking not even angry at	him	752.7865400918521
14497. just as he knew that she had stopped loving him	375.01059695668357
14498. the brahmaputra	has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering	white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any	other space on the planet	4833.640715751984
14499. for a brief period each year the rays of	the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep	at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the	daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow	seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys	on their long meandering journey to the sea- running east past the	sky-carving massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turning	south and curling down through the jungles of assam past the khasi	hills and into bengal past sirinjani and madaripur until the	hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields	and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the	bay of bengal	0.20124717349522497
14500. keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra	more times than he could remember during the war days when	he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those	times before man was guiding himself through outer space	6567.904501533385
14501. but keith	looked down more than up	94.26719671643181
14502. he thought of the jungles below him and	of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself	that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner	of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals	the lords	7129.004365496585
14503. at first it had been just a romantic dream of his	the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war	2191.866379489173
14504. but after	the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself	1643.2066467884101
14505. wing	commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either	in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves	2736.068898768347
14506. and keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a	man paradoxically who might even survive	2581.457636022215
14507. he became a fighter pilot	after the stint over the hump in the big crates	1105.4975732704659
14508. the raf was britain's	weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way	her sons could serve her best at this point in the war	4278.357493178056
14509. he knew	how to shoot down nazis	94.1473051140563
14510. and he knew that the men talked about him	behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else- including	the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was	chemically incapable of fear	6166.035974092643
14511. that was true but only half the truth	167.84288139338605
14512. the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself	753.0152200301153
14513. not defending england or being an ace or fighting	for humanity	507.92929717726054
14514. and he would have enjoyed it	just as much if he had been a nazi	1655.0072296389626
14515. nowadays we talk as though	the blitz were just a short skirmish	645.9201137526196
14516. the nazis bombed britain	so the raf retaliated and shot them all down	1190.3190059787069
14517. it	was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid	insistence of the british on their right to their own country became	ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better	organized and technically superior	4299.371811211049
14518. it took a long time before the	british tipped the balance	754.9319305979523
14519. keith learned too much about air	combat and air killing to be risked	783.8551774950311
14520. they grounded him	and put	him	in the command offices	563.1642516337428
14521. that was where he met penny	43.52076110040932
14522. he was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking american wac	a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work	in the command offices	but that was all	4472.746583649248
14523. penny knew him better on her part	93.18489477182183
14524. he had a war	reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals	2110.141424308075
14525. they don't go for bull-like muscle as a rule	264.08062897615065
14526. he had strength	in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier	2114.4564553112627
14527. he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that	give away the power in forearm and bicep	2321.9393906389514
14528. his hair was black	already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only	one permitted to a man	2833.601406602616
14529. the pretty little twittering wacs said	he had the look of eagles- and penny hating the cliche had to	admit that in this case it applied	2721.6857971652453
14530. penny	and keith had no romance	65.64264347532034
14531. but they met	in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly	933.4447006692408
14532. the command offices were in the border country up north where the	radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters	were dispatched to harry the enemy	4279.558768399382
14533. the nazis knew this of course	and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let	a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit	3217.3060039219645
14534. this	time they had been lucky	65.45270229862146
14535. the command post was underground and	well camouflaged	167.19567809828044
14536. but there hadn't been enough time to build it for	keeps	745.2905089433992
14537. there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and	ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that	concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a	direct hit comes along	4114.53411955992
14538. this one was actually more of a near	miss	391.0583333983199
14539. the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not	precisely into the command room itself	1421.307202730634
14540. there was a shattering cracking	sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust	and flying debris and everyone in the room- men and women hit the	floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered	6241.970303738096
14541. that is	everyone but keith and penny	93.7155858225145
14542. they stood there just the two	of them in the rocking shattering blast	1184.8369045576592
14543. keith was on his feet because	he didn't care at all about life any more: penny on her feet	proudly because she cared too much	2591.800570868214
14544. the bomb was a solitary	one	65.86464345741929
14545. the blast damaged but did not destroy the room	261.57723710515256
14546. keith's eyes	met penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction	1401.7055461107577
14547. and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks	and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across	the debris to penny and took her hand in his	3743.1569355768347
14548. the chaplain	married them on the next day	250.389293124831
14549. after the war penny had wanted	keith at least to visit her home with her	1092.9268556671127
14550. she came from ohio	from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed	it was to farmer-type farmers	3257.7284797479233
14551. but to keith's london-bred mind	such acreage sounded rather invincible	376.84686075196817
14552. it wasn't that however which	decided them not to go to america	960.3204287892204
14553. keith told penny about his	dream to return to india and burma	638.8241932308441
14554. he stressed the wild beauty of	the mountains and the jungles	753.1812324009511
14555. he didn't tell her the truth he now	freely admitted to himself	639.9418066477472
14556. that was his	true love not penny	140.61426825090481
14557. the terrible power of a gun the thing that	blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never	wanted to lose	2865.0654312697948
14558. and in the hunting land this hunger was considered	to be a noble thing	1407.6078939311678
14559. when they got to shillong in assam	he was happy	372.7329412843562
14560. this is a paradise for hunters	65.83568579573424
14561. this was the land of the	sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the	spread	1573.521182276234
14562. the sambur buck the jungle stag	that is even more noble than the scottish elk	1657.5145236293242
14563. he even hunted elephant	although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african	cousin	1425.82751445326
14564. but there are big rogues in both countries	251.98803995292116
14565. these were	the ones keith sought out- the loners the ones who killed for the	joy of it like himself	1872.0151031481685
14566. he and penny would go out on tame elephants	raised from babyhood in the keddah	1649.352770768294
14567. and while he was ever	alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the	eden they were traversing	2032.9588980395579
14568. they came upon cheetal deer at woodland	pools	249.25722590674417
14569. peacocks strutted across their path preening	43.80759883541092
14570. there were fantastic	flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song	753.2196213694031
14571. mouse	deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty	legs thrashed too close	1578.5323382481101
14572. wild boar watched their progress with little	pig eyes and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game	worthy of a shot from the 	2536.2526784287375
14573. now the next morning they were anchored at the elbow and the boat	was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned	to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms	with the weighted line beside it; and robinson roy who had gone	down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free	dive was already back on the surface	0.20124717349522497
14574. he and his safety man	herr schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together	1409.7264733307707
14575. the german	courteously indicated that robinson should mount first	260.4858100000755
14576. robinson	clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank	assembly	1426.4920853122194
14577. he took his mask from his forehead	and threw it unexpectedly across the deck	935.569282425989
14578. temper temper	mrs forsythe said laughing uneasily	140.37196168309003
14579. a phony blonde hanging	onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck	she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was	not yet ten am   i loused it rob said with a	savage note in his voice	4592.728953888855
14580. all i have to do to set the record is to	go on down	1421.9864909979121
14581. so instead i come up	14.83451498158951
14582. was it my equipment	4.3987935668219444
14583. the german asked	0.20041515
14584. was it something went bad with the breathing	251.8997540576304
14585. the equipment was fine rob stated standing	up	166.92701279426853
14586. he was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely	strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that	was submerged under his present agitation	4447.458248762898
14587. he stared stonily at the	floor	43.70919263503215
14588. i was down to 275	22.200344252078626
14589. i've been that far half a dozen times	166.82080076787616
14590. i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick	1402.5900901244033
14591. well i get it artie said still on the ladder	372.39727055980484
14592. you	are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting	a record	1663.093400028301
14593. and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that	tells you to turn around before you drown yourself	1874.860688536123
14594. no it wasn't that rob said	64.78751972583146
14595. a note of awe came	into his voice	168.08645983739135
14596. when i came up damnit i thought i was going	down	750.9911886457819
14597. i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening	636.8770335729915
14598. pressure-happy artie said and climbed in	65.30474844146548
14599. i was expecting it sure	14.725398265823287
14600. but when it happens to you like that i tell you and you're a	hundred feet from where you thought you were- well it makes you think	4293.753662594427
14601. you don't head back down again	43.741466361060965
14602. not right away	0.30041514999999996
14603. he had his voice under control again: no one became aware that	he was terrified by what had just happened to him	2181.8888523307382
14604. waddell	the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut	heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat	3481.5550070868826
14605. now he	was going to show how much he knew	371.8918746786862
14606. our boy didn't chicken out	no sir	140.3628236118954
14607. he ran into the rapture of the depths	166.62409203215907
14608. it	makes the diver feel drunk	65.91368283172845
14609. well that's the only way	to be mrs forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh	1094.223982292423
14610. maybe not if you're 200 feet under water artie said	556.5657558992996
14611. it's nothing to fool with	14.804309904647301
14612. personally i don't blame him for giving up the dive	much as i regret losing the story	2125.186805076476
14613. nobody's giving	anything up robinson said	43.57658107531212
14614. he stood there towering over them	all: gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group; and	yet like a child among adults	3490.1464363415653
14615. you think i got you and artie and	herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride	1888.6665854446178
14616. i'm	going down again	4.419584401375908
14617. that's my boy! mr forsythe	exclaimed	43.34762909631129
14618. rob's not going to give up as easy as all that	754.9428864862497
14619. he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his	yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels	2021.8613878961125
14620. he went to key west	every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know	that his title of commodore was never used without irony	4812.065239594968
14621. old	commodore forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether	he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without	accidentally turning on something else first	3336.192158003406
14622. now it did not occur	to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again:	rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object	of his pride	5782.989940623277
14623. why he went on when rob asked me	if he could make his dive on this trip i didn't think twice about	it	2313.896732183438
14624. i've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around	his brother's tackle shop	1882.0912583281847
14625. hell i gave him the first decent	job he ever had six seven- how many years ago was it rob	1884.366709099504
14626. seven years ago commodore rob said impassively	140.3947424798484
14627. he was	thinking big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven	years and no better off than when i started	2184.1181376039594
14628. excuse me he	said abruptly	22.106490437839028
14629. he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters;	went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him	2187.8805444847767
14630. when you gotta go you gotta go mrs forsythe said	566.748784720998
14631. waddell muttered something about taking a look around and	climbed up to the flying bridge	1111.2838675357298
14632. he was disturbed by what had happened	on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the	night before with the german who had come out of the head while he	was fixing himself a drink in the galley	6807.046251638455
14633. hi there schaffner	he had said	43.661840903380735
14634. can i make you one	22.542207053958137
14635. no thank	you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english	643.1587985694593
14636. i do not drink so much thank you	250.69445455892634
14637. waddell had looked the	man over trying to size him up	502.3913801370153
14638. he was in his early forties rather	short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved	and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways	4823.5863156186515
14639. his	open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into	his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence	2743.167748727542
14640. waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommel's afrika	corps and he said to himself: i'd hate to run into him in the desert	on a dark night	5014.254670941089
14641. aloud he had said making conversation:	rob tells me he's using your atlantis equipment on the dive	1411.9770100228936
14642. yes herr schaffner had said	22.319105708120468
14643. he's one	hell of a decent boy	94.01372398148843
14644. i agree yes	0.30041514999999996
14645. and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import	rights to your line for this country is that right	2020.069306871598
14646. well	no herr schaffner said	22.200913135649877
14647. waddell turned to face him	14.897008905882917
14648. but that's what he told me	64.60659280092659
14649. why that's	his main reason for making the dive	261.25546153200474
14650. shaffner looked at	him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a	little spreading gesture with his two hands	2818.744419283446
14651. what do you mean	2.9582261493230706
14652. waddell asked frowning	0.30041514999999996
14653. please let me explain	the german said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit	932.5544954317127
14654. i have	in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year	1186.3510206670258
14655. now	i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very	strong	940.8343221859368
14656. i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national	distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my	products	3280.370455211855
14657. with all respect to a fine young man mr roy is not able	to provide these necessaries	1420.4267723150483
14658. waddell was not an eminently	moral person but he did not like what he had just heard	2115.8973928344703
14659. did you	tell him all this	43.35166104833772
14660. he asked	0.30041514999999996
14661. perhaps not in so many	words the german said	263.52832059502873
14662. but surely you have misunderstood mr	roy	141.23264888978704
14663. never never did i offer him the exclusive rights	262.94328605521684
14664. we spoke	of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would	be most useful for publicity	2819.3345412358344
14665. he was most eager to make the dive;	of course i was willing	784.4350690572422
14666. but there was no definite agreement about	business arrangements	395.62841038677186
14667. there	was the end of his front-page feature story with byline	498.03972439564325
14668. he started	out the door	22.21708326592573
14669. one moment! herr schaffner said	14.8108353930161
14670. you	intend to speak with mr roy	140.45606601899004
14671. what else	0.20041515
14672. waddell asked	0.30041514999999996
14673. if you will pardon i think it would be	better if not	642.5133524672667
14674. mr roy is determined to make this dive	248.0513825626662
14675. whatever	you tell him he will dive	93.9965987362367
14676. i know this from my talks with him	252.03465625312703
14677. well let's let him make up his own mind ok	375.6004132890565
14678. waddell	said	0.30041514999999996
14679. on the basis of the facts	43.60984640649819
14680. you will make	him unhappy and anxious the german said	564.770983800627
14681. at 200 300 400 feet	under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will	be thinking about what you are telling him	2734.0763186704844
14682. it is not good mr	waddell: you will do him great harm	966.1270049330287
14683. there was no doubt	that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said	937.616390157742
14684. waddell came	back from the door and sat on a bunk	755.9597063275991
14685. i am an honest man	the german said with fervor	375.215555709145
14686. i will give mr roy his due for	this dive	558.4066336828823
14687. i will make him distributor for all of florida- a big	market	639.3112911027622
14688. all tourists come to florida	22.08026758012879
14689. this will help him to get out	of his little tackle shop	635.0794987039751
14690. yes! but there is no use causing him	to worry at this time	1176.5979237741988
14691. the german's words worked on the	newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty	952.737921302483
14692. he took a big swig	of his drink	251.06360588219664
14693. it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like	this	793.3160942635074
14694. i think maybe you're right schaffner he said	249.6223515788106
14695. he	has the distributorship for florida you say	167.4599992754841
14696. yes	the german said	4.41411768167019
14697. at least for south florida	14.889816273691858
14698. by	god waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this	time of all times	2096.1000369810126
14699. he sloshed his drink	around and drained it in a few large gulps	785.3437138419091
14700. the story was shaping up	nicely in his mind: the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving	the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business	america	4492.952333241325
14701. join me in another	2.931369208986516
14702. he had asked	0.30041514999999996
14703. thank	you the german had said courteously	94.16083084476267
14704. i do not drink so much	65.08144936282703
14705. now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside	a bunk	789.0665280776391
14706. fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions	248.5403380016706
14707. he pressed	his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers	in a hurried and anxious whisper	1871.8872698057353
14708. blessed saint nicholas	i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up	instead of down when i was bewildered	3664.379637294539
14709. and when i make the dive again-	he paused; crossed himself; said a hail mary slowly and	with understanding	1727.6423717016237
14710. folding between his hands the cross that hung	from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters	2350.4790336660576
14711. holy mary	mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next	dive	1402.2327053431898
14712. make it come off all right	65.212413088017
14713. let me set the record this time	and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive	2030.078181386599
14714. and make my life different and better from this time on	751.7952575026171
14715. he crossed himself again and rose	43.51119739656364
14716. he felt a good deal less	shaky	140.16404723884608
14717. as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when	he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk	2969.903249656713
14718. artie	had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger	1176.9479934873564
14719. he waited	awhile before he said roy you know your decompression table	don't you	942.7161859061041
14720. you know i know it robinson answered	warily	251.08750053584555
14721. you came straight up from 275 without a stop	artie said	502.4432076194165
14722. well i was a little bit confused	140.93016789054
14723. anyway	i wasn't down long enough to matter	166.56338681247368
14724. you don't see me stretched	out	on the deck do you	755.5219468096573
14725. you know what they say about two	deep dives in one day artie went on still twirling the snorkle and	studying it intently	2315.788389722388
14726. i don't think you should go down again	253.73667559994774
14727. early that day matsuo saw a marine	94.84390880240238
14728. the enemy came looming	around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot then fled	without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest	and his legs were rubbery	5785.8102489518615
14729. as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the	panic and resolved to make a stand	1250.2370705494416
14730. he crossed the next meadow and	climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed	1423.8969040923323
14731. in the leafiest	part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over	the meadow	1578.0551821730783
14732. for	a while he was content to let events develop in their	good time	1399.0721266674266
14733. he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column	and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come	hunting	2734.8550758517104
14734. his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured	others for the sheer pleasure	963.0283830814933
14735. yesterday; today; tomorrow: no	surrender	14.93557422400844
14736. his remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only	a faint chill of doubt	1189.611602663396
14737. he murmured to himself with firmness: no	surrender	167.67284712204213
14738. it was best to die fighting the marines	251.90807306510715
14739. his superiors	had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor	932.1060799471259
14740. what if the marines never came	65.60928207006023
14741. his comrades were all dead	14.842845730651826
14742. then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide	563.011079401574
14743. whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green	his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes	2030.7478347173633
14744. he sighed and leaned	for a moment against the trunk	564.2500946875605
14745. his fingers touched the bone handle	of a knife	263.2044540968552
14746. the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle	of purified water hung on his belt	1884.5037183788845
14747. besides the belt he wore a loin	cloth	167.87734859099368
14748. as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw	a marine in the jungle across the clearing	2833.8777284353146
14749. the	marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though	debating whether to brave the sunlight	2048.110823741591
14750. his fatigues made a streak	of almost phosphorescent green in the mist	960.0755352317894
14751. come out come	out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath	640.7610193095738
14752. the man	leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face	1188.3242150917
14753. a signal	0.20041515
14754. matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for	steadiness	1419.7995822883595
14755. fresh on his mind were events of the past day when	his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills	1727.1731909322698
14756. they had fought from	caves and the marines resorted to burning them out	1179.2595059036562
14757. even now like	a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting	great orange billows	1584.0372497671874
14758. a wave of flame rippling through their	cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted	through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his	uniform blazing	5651.912028050225
14759. the marines let him advance	14.932750543991059
14760. when he sank on his knees	they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of	mercy	2351.838628468525
14761. matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses	both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly	under the tropical sun	2738.6121318703376
14762. the callous marines had laughed at each other's	retching while stacking bodies	961.915707286353
14763. matsuo repeatedly choked down	his own nausea	94.22270544534014
14764. at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside	and into the jungle reeking of death	2363.6526893782084
14765. apprehensively he	peered	to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze	946.6698205464027
14766. he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with	the one left to distract him	2369.308502524402
14767. cautious feet	stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers:	he heard none of these	1414.4247585411817
14768. only the hum of insects and the distant	fluttering call of a bird	1178.2656167744574
14769. because he couldn't hear them he was	more convinced they were there	637.5978523911175
14770. a spectacle occurred across the	meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise	on a tree trunk he embraced it	3721.298308035646
14771. while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some	dull maneuver	1258.279733026625
14772. taking aim at the man's face matsuo squeezed the	trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind	3260.690939225365
14773. he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the	head	1107.8809786946204
14774. the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound	249.54708604432707
14775. like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo	awaited reaction from the jungle	646.120408371608
14776. how stupid to give his position	away	140.2346668636206
14777. the jungle did not retort	14.799485730558349
14778. the sitter remained seated	hugging the tree	142.1610735295012
14779. before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy	and insects hummed and birds occasionally called	1257.7168789714876
14780. matsuo puzzled	and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he	was the butt of a devilish joke	2597.5655521772264
14781. five or so minutes later the	marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing	his hands over his eyes	2040.3591292507267
14782. he went into a whirling dance a sort of	blind chasing of the tail	1419.2910944628552
14783. it ended when he tumbled; but jumping right	up he staggered in no particular direction	1097.3451988116817
14784. he wore no head cover	of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon	1652.1608735466064
14785. with a sudden	decisiveness he lurched in matsuo's direction crossing the meadow	in a zigzagging gallop	1259.2542097332102
14786. when he got closer to the tree matsuo	noted the wild look on his face	1650.327674630918
14787. the pockets of his jacket bulged	43.21276472981857
14788. the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot	him in the upper trunk	1654.7353012098952
14789. the marine spun clapping a hand high	on his chest and dived forward	789.0652040024544
14790. in the hush that followed the echoes	matsuo was tense	561.8230949222906
14791. they could come on him now without difficulty	166.65529141189865
14792. gradually he reached a conclusion	22.287550031917267
14793. the marine was alone for they	were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from	the tree	2036.5867451854551
14794. down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of	foliage	962.6287467625389
14795. the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended	502.7128308665212
14796. matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out	250.84949128002532
14797. reflex	0.20041515
14798. rifle leveled on the man he made a rush	393.8331998330888
14799. heat in the sunlight pressed	in like an invisible crowd	376.28538078927784
14800. he squatted by the head gently	placing the rifle	on the ground	970.5576045572465
14801. with a snakestrike motion he grasped the	hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back	1427.5673614927405
14802. the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone;	around the hole blood glistened in a little patch	2810.8955607845583
14803. maintaining his	clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in	the jacket pockets	1422.0651311736867
14804. in one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated	lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding	1895.7469940200667
14805. in the other: a	wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief	784.2162384545023
14806. one	by one he tossed the objects aside	252.4748191853734
14807. he didn't smoke and could not light	fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact	time even had the watch been running	2873.5478413344727
14808. then there was no saying how	many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief	2119.7011347574407
14809. too bad the marine had no water	94.69817127095925
14810. from its holder he took his own canteen	251.79996170139708
14811. the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied	pressure	946.1445422630972
14812. the marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted	in the glare	953.2049627084883
14813. matsuo put the bottle to his	own lips	166.9970511346441
14814. the marine reached up a hand	65.06441115605449
14815. none	for you	0.20041515
14816. the marine blinked soon dropping his hand	138.85944785803753
14817. not only	had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on	1268.54964902042
14818. you	came well equipped to die	65.158624948357
14819. some odor made him lean over	the man	167.77550697975852
14820. he sniffed and recognized it	21.993197792972236
14821. so that had been his	difficulty	43.212627460064404
14822. drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his	bivouac	758.3168857911387
14823. the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned	501.96769290702605
14824. when he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow matsuo	seized his hair and pulled him back over	3051.4853392803307
14825. awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water	bottle	794.2543160376979
14826. the smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his	thoughts	755.4254213835926
14827. in the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of	sake	640.6811253607552
14828. the marine shut his eyes	22.286473788045306
14829. are you a thrower of	flame marine	94.05631771300474
14830. matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and	laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their	shadows	3695.966895620707
14831. he waited in his squat gripping the hair	166.94182369382014
14832. every	so often he turned the knife	142.29545487789687
14833. its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight	168.15849629048367
14834. the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was	dripping	1182.7997674878084
14835. wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an	oily film	795.6558491267763
14836. the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes	563.2682269435769
14837. now and	again he murmured something that ended in a giggle	499.88674189837485
14838. he must have saturated	himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his	drunken haze	2816.691430220135
14839. at last he reached	for the knife	93.98498971593396
14840. even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved	the marine's handkerchief to wrap it	1406.7600976473855
14841. first he barely touched the	blade on the hand which shaded the eyes	792.548269633548
14842. the marine yelled and flung	the hand away	250.80294822414606
14843. with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the	blade flat on a cheek	1261.0019725634133
14844. a shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands	that circled matsuo's wrist	958.3401584452624
14845. matsuo wrenched free and burned the	hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when	they came groping again	2022.8276813167577
14846. the marine commenced to weep and it blighted	the sense of enjoyment	961.0760713025566
14847. a small measure	of payment marine	43.33315209387482
14848. he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the	rifle behind a shoulder	1185.2016899542027
14849. the marine hands on cheeks rolled	by his unwounded side onto his stomach	786.1231692643779
14850. matsuo	walked toward his tree once glancing back	253.2036358038471
14851. he would soon die	2.953677061016683
14852. as matsuo climbed by using the vines	and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like	a jungle shadow	3714.5286145841455
14853. what now	0.20041515
14854. in the jungle birds were mute while	insects preserved only the monotony of living	1410.3664933370023
14855. it was the marine: head lifted he strained and called	377.1358942965375
14856. then he	astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat	958.0877408717273
14857. he	cupped his mouth and yelled	43.66686291645944
14858. matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder	141.7204633246892
14859. once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die	637.6623034701927
14860. it sounded as if the man were calling him: hey	japanese h hey there japanese	1658.070531611966
14861. the man tilted back his	head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container	1260.598548807923
14862. he	performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct	1652.3486934204188
14863. the marine nodded	vigorously	2.936976808759697
14864. matsuo laughed slung the rifle	22.401537196315523
14865. the marine	was a winehead	14.860953056314923
14866. his superiors had said that all marines were depraved	389.29872867159025
14867. the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before	an idol	794.7555627947929
14868. remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle	558.664661069799
14869. one swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty but he must	observe water discipline	1412.718008453558
14870. his years of campaigning had taught him	the value of water discipline	965.9984122188741
14871. he began to uncap the bottle	the rusty cap squealing on its threads	794.1028915540603
14872. popping upright the marine waved	both hands and shouted	395.2557123600195
14873. of course it was water he really	craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out	1883.358121545559
14874. the	marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack	1404.3878656613613
14875. he had no water for an enemy	94.32013926995378
14876. and when this was	gone he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water	if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool	3897.7855573420943
14877. he capped the	bottle and replaced it	94.02683587181664
14878. after all he had less reason to desire it	than the marine	959.1691428088088
14879. before much longer the marine quieted down	95.24718878004151
14880. the upper part of his packet had stained dark	393.32518260296206
14881. there is nothing for you matsuo said	94.06844565992094
14882. your superiors	will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it	1409.7626742301165
14883. from the convulsive quivers of	the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping	1253.025349180417
14884. he reminded	matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china	960.4718026276944
14885. in china	it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked	with the village burning about him and shells exploding	2184.822111736539
14886. chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables	as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and	walked towards the bar	3934.173129430675
14887. only blue throat and his gang stayed where	they were	373.4757186908032
14888. blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows	supporting his massive frame	1653.050054651024
14889. he leered at the stranger as the	distance between them closed	504.71851849982374
14890. since when did they allow beardless	kids into the saloon bars of this town boys	1638.399986000527
14891. he asked	0.20041515
14892. seems	to me i don't remember altering any law about that	748.1936031756824
14893. he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer	507.4882684888921
14894. stay	right here where you are kid he called	394.0865185934041
14895. i don't aim	to have minors breathing down my neck when i'm a-drinking:	the stranger ignored him	1418.56776042319
14896. he didn't stop till he was within three	feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right	hand was on the butt of his revolver	4452.72957780694
14897. i'm billy tilghman	said the stranger and i've come for pat conyers' body	794.1505410779235
14898. and what makes you think you're going to get it pretty	boy	956.4150392893771
14899. because i'm asking	0.20041515
14900. most of the time i get	what i ask for	556.4281095741628
14901. blue throat winked at his six cronies	93.76186903097326
14902. the kid has no manners boys	65.7595098150874
14903. shall we teach him some	14.957112240872581
14904. his	gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never	left its holster	2117.260126243897
14905. tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific	right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin	2036.874342044265
14906. his	head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where	his buddies were sprawling	2130.2780183365667
14907. tilghman leapt on to him dragged	him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against	the bar	1882.5426065182987
14908. a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghman's	stomach as blue throat's henchmen started shooting	2374.6073974433593
14909. tilghman	flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun	795.8966771318255
14910. the colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing	393.1538461240391
14911. a third shot	doused the light	44.026987641030495
14912. somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled	you all right billy	1653.8733139959154
14913. yes george but i ain't	got poor old pat's body yet	501.4446502434839
14914. and i aim to have it	64.67652443448478
14915. he fired	again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed	500.3820882448484
14916. another took off	his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor	1191.2364249314166
14917. and me said another blue throat	henchman	93.49017910710424
14918. tilghman and his partner	george rust herded the men into a corner	969.8466861270051
14919. and now said tilghman	with deadly calm i'll repeat what i said	642.0547621733134
14920. i've come	for pat conyers' body	65.32415426133498
14921. in two minutes the body of tilghman's	former comrade who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling	brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral	parlor to be prepared for decent burial	3854.3836039052003
14922. blue throat nursing an aching	jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the	survivors of the fight	3478.847558365071
14923. that critter will be back tomorrow	predicted george rust and he'll bring fifty of his kind	back with him	1729.7025289465714
14924. blue throat won't stand for this	64.67501193164387
14925. he'll shoot up	the town	14.842095524262536
14926. the reverend james	doran had scarcely completed pat conyers' last rites on boot	hill in the township of petrie when shots were heard in the distance	4086.597824684856
14927. amen said the reverend doran grabbing his rifle propped	up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that	our presence is required elsewhere	2741.3151289481425
14928. billy tilghman and	his comrades rode off to the battle	562.8960433464958
14929. blue throat who had ruled the	town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention	of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship	2469.917441774235
14930. it was essential	that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring	ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored wild west method	of doing it	4088.2181938613185
14931. he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and	liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance	to main street	2480.3373074919464
14932. the entire length of the street could be raked with	rifle fire from this barn	1654.2938319359887
14933. any posse riding down the street to demand	blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst	of fire	2040.1379993699716
14934. the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered	inside kaster's store halfway down the street	1413.75337919382
14935. several were firing	into the barn when billy tilghman arrived	377.9925887038023
14936. he sized up the situation	and shook his head	392.75645220080264
14937. if blue throat has his way he'll	keep us all cooped up in here for days he said	1564.9934092724866
14938. there's only	one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very	store	2346.8217982974343
14939. he called the store owner and together they went into	the stockroom	639.6350223610323
14940. billy returned with six sticks of dynamite	140.3763089329954
14941. i'm	gonna drop these into blue throat's lap he announced and	i'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near	enough to toss 'em through the window	3444.7029416484866
14942. he slipped outside	hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways	959.1248263194162
14943. blue throat's	men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts	and board walk as he passed	1889.5390553612178
14944. fifty yards away from the barn	he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back	2361.241363902441
14945. here he	couldn't be seen by blue throat and his gang	504.0143934783685
14946. all he had to do	was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of	an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through	4852.635554757006
14947. billy	tilghman did just that	14.841185271089454
14948. within seconds the big barn was blasted into	smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside	2361.1120969534163
14949. it was the abrupt end of blue throat's dictatorship in petrie	499.71811490115545
14950. though	only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to	those parts	1176.51118271799
14951. to tilghman the incident was just one of a long	list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the	law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did	not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning	a drunk to be quiet	5089.399116109359
14952. of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys	of the old west uncle billy tilghman stands out head and	shoulders	2610.6245853479313
14953. he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any	other famous gun-slinging character in the book	1407.4029346498924
14954. he saw the most action	beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and	sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal	who lived before or after him	5782.281215284598
14955. for fifty years his guns and	ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the	enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west	3218.983092562354
14956. the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified	almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remained	strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career	his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the	west have remained almost unsung	7339.904204436067
14957. citizens took the view that	a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway	but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of	half a century	3760.173341029381
14958. he came within an ace of being riddled with bullets	during his long fight with the doolin gang which terrorized oklahoma	in the 1890's	3683.222336653328
14959. led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized	in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed	banks making liberal use of their guns	2738.624380403647
14960. bill doolin's ambition	it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of	jesse james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had sworn he would	stop him	5011.371905946902
14961. tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove	with the doolin gang	501.9442783683655
14962. they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw	kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their	houses	2839.640629500032
14963. billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers	named ed dunn who lived at rock fort	1884.558335924624
14964. on a bitterly	cold day in january 1895 accompanied only by neal brown as his	deputy tilghman left the township of guthrie and headed for rock fort	and dunn's ranch	4846.30881822474
14965. it was snowing hard when they got there and	they saw no horses outside	936.9681074332959
14966. the only evidence of occupation came from	the chimney which was belching out thick smoke	1639.8161780927148
14967. the two lawmen	halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door	642.4171167728357
14968. wait here	neal said tilghman	22.329330195821523
14969. if i don't come out within half an	hour ride back to town and bring out a posse	1574.9115380602066
14970. leaving his rifle	in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it	1886.4083804543188
14971. there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside	1099.3601265493958
14972. directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight	on that bitterly cold day	2115.5529012163697
14973. seated near it with his back to the door	was the rancher ed dunn	943.862997189279
14974. the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move	248.9736847357226
14975. tilghman	closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire	504.7362975537588
14976. suddenly	he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch	and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck	3892.916570161606
14977. along each side	of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain	1424.4550579469546
14978. and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the	gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman	2353.4553484001044
14979. the	fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs	might slam into his hide	1885.8535372256943
14980. thinking fast tilghman never	hesitated for one instant	250.05510084935548
14981. he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully	unaware of the guns covering him	1259.3714027983515
14982. the men behind them were	bill doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer	1872.331810916357
14983. cold	day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually	presenting his backside to the fire	1415.76680004274
14984. just dropped in to ask where	jed hawkins lives	391.19425550378406
14985. can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow	166.10108039617677
14986. he wouldn't look tilghman in	the face	141.45315140799846
14987. follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely	260.8025820955589
14988. jed's	homestead is on the south bank	142.08280759905747
14989. resisting the overwhelming	temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap	tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation	for a good ten minutes	2717.660864093701
14990. all that time rifle barrels were pointing	unwaveringly at his head and body	1185.8971147184218
14991. one false move on his part and	he would be a dead man	791.100667934242
14992. well he announced guess i'll	be going now ed and thanks for the warmup	1416.7852274708976
14993. he strolled back	to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him	784.5797596847881
14994. he	left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace	and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been	allowed to come out alive	4658.0115795200845
14995. but he knew well enough that those	guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon	2036.0782523195444
14996. if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his	deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly	3487.7815912306205
14997. leisurely	he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown	499.9359573919026
14998. don't say or	do anything he said softly	250.72432032359157
14999. just get out of here without it looking	as though we're in a hurry	939.9348103175447
15000. that place is crawling with bill	doolin and his gang	559.7473440906717
15001. even as he spoke those words billy	tilghman's life hung on a thread	794.5853891779957
15002. back in the house a hoodlum named	red buck sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed	jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right	then	5492.698450840009
15003. you'll stay right here commanded bill doolin	covering red with his rifle	641.3492674482449
15004. billy tilghman is too good a man	to shoot in the back	962.486099170889
15005. but the fighting	marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a	full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell oklahoma where	he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets	4144.733799024098
15006. wiley lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous	day and had been drinking ever since	2356.552038042645
15007. that night he reeled out	of ma murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting	off his revolver	2027.33697727557
15008. for several months now jack carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen	with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot	of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a woman	6218.867272241921
15009. this	woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she	radiated warmth a sweet warmth; she would talk to him in a soothing	voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put	her hands on him and kiss him passionately	4849.8490271007
15010. when she would do these	things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach	2600.955495954192
15011. then he would run to the toilet behind the house	374.3233209030871
15012. sometimes he	did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always	with him	2351.807428983775
15013. he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother	and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell	it on him	2853.8489805447784
15014. but they never said anything so he figured it was all right	955.2872765571843
15015. and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room	chestnut school where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the woman	of jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure	3553.0200346624756
15016. he could	not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at	night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous	woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as	he used to do	7348.091160862745
15017. when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and	he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh	2849.245350237542
15018. miss langford was an attractive	girl	65.85882115840715
15019. tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut	a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils	in her fresh starched summer dress	2976.816274393993
15020. something was beginning to stir	and come alive in her too	she was twenty now; but if it had been it had been smothered until	: you could tell it by the way she watched the older	bigger boys like jack	4962.625678767841
15021. she would look at jack with that hidden	something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become breathless	and a little sick	2597.2568059831674
15022. school began in august the hottest	part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was very	lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort	of get acquainted with one another	6317.779397547785
15023. the first two or three days they	went home early	372.62253570258997
15024. all that is except jack	22.146291489934967
15025. he hung around	the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss	langford straightened desks and put the room in order	2178.7380025476346
15026. once	she kneeled down to pick up some books	where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress-	at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg	4652.081461529841
15027. he thought for a moment	his heart had stopped beating	373.8555376831391
15028. about that time miss langford straightened	up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although	probably she didn't even see him	3698.2488709638324
15029. he jumped back ducked and ran	crouching down the hill away from the school	951.1054392998783
15030. he didn't	look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and	out of breath; then he slowed to a walk	4075.3498381588774
15031. the vision became even stronger	now	43.79494645891705
15032. i'll get her yet	he muttered to himself	249.4626078425436
15033. i've got to get her	14.687664757787278
15034. that night he dreamed	a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the	teacher did everything except engage in the act	and when he	awoke the next morning his heart was afire	5786.359904529866
15035. he ate litle that	morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate	heartily	1256.1025087447558
15036. what's the matter honey	4.434704908105454
15037. she said with the	solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child	788.9281474819365
15038. aren't	you hungry	0.30041514999999996
15039. no i'm not hungry he said pushing	back the bacon and eggs	643.4304012687348
15040. outside it was already hot at 7:30 am	and it was getting hot in the kitchen	1876.8177194275443
15041. he felt a little sick at	his stomach	166.2266645213667
15042. are you sick	0.30041514999999996
15043. no he said	0.20041515
15044. i guess it's this hot weather	65.22857672901625
15045. don't you play hard today then	43.263671113528815
15046. and if you get sick ask the teacher	to let you come home early	1416.7336178937753
15047. daddy left the car for me and i'm	going to town this afternoon	780.5547468222976
15048. o k i won't	play hard he promised	249.3249719804121
15049. just then charles lever yelled hey	jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house	and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen	door yelling good-bye mom over his shoulder	3968.829618403951
15050. whaddya	say boy	0.30041514999999996
15051. charles said grinning showing his huge yellow	teeth	167.35506372736552
15052. charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with	straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes	2608.057860600385
15053. he considered	himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him	942.7611446166254
15054. you know what i done last night	141.87389529141618
15055. charles said as	they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away	from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to	the school	3570.063525484236
15056. jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded	would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles'	only apparent interest	3902.3545189401607
15057. but jack always derived vicarious sensual	thrills from charles' revelations	so he usually invited them as he	did now	1731.5279681902841
15058. what	0.30041514999999996
15059. i got margaret rider in one	of them old box cars down there by the quarry	1257.6205501620327
15060. a nude imaginary	picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind	746.4270682363801
15061. hell you say	0.20041515
15062. he said lapsing into the profanity	he often used when away from his parents and especially when he	was with charles	3051.8299020202817
15063. how'd you do it	2.934656529649969

15072. i might try it one of these days	jack said wonderingly thinking of miss langford	1631.3649218987111
15073. when	they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already	there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse	2322.379538796319
15074. miss	langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without	socks was out there with them trying to get them inside	3452.998767532834
15075. time	for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store	bell in her right hand	1090.8065022462229
15076. oh come	on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls	begged smiling wistfully	2353.5624963534938
15077. no not now said the teacher	43.799541162763504
15078. come inside now	0.30041514999999996
15079. the children	grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse	502.48316705531926
15080. jack watched miss langford all morning	64.78121859547188
15081. he could think of nothing	else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles	had said that morning about margaret rider	2452.5632456294297
15082. occasionally he would	look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green	organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he coud hardly believe	she would do what charles had said she did	5947.602866646286
15083. at noontime	remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the	kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys	except charles went off out the road to play ball	3861.290113230306
15084. why ain't	you playin' ball	22.143955564123015
15085. he asked charles suspiciously as they sat	in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the	schoolhouse	1878.3894084769515
15086. miss langford come out and play with us like you	promised several of the little girls called	2117.703193522964
15087. i'd druther	stay here and watch the girls charles grinned	376.0960904814851
15088. maybe some	of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress	1184.9099783028803
15089. maybe	jack said idly watching for miss langford	165.26963411521558
15090. presently	she came out of the schoolhouse	139.64949364784565
15091. when she appeared two or three	of the little girls jumped up and down yelling goody goody	1421.4848672574678
15092. let's play with 'em jack said rising from where	he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants	2829.3435777044897
15093. ok	charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join	the girls	1100.4088024440616
15094. they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap	560.9842967443668
15095. then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls	jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young	teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over	her head	4205.970010223526
15096. while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get	on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said gosh	i'm sorry miss langford	4607.453132959492
15097. i didn't mean to pull so hard	92.77686572943644
15098. that's all right she said tossing her head back	to get the hair out of her eyes	2109.713391152393
15099. with one hand	she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with	the other	1403.3225786592907
15100. when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he	felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet	3454.577688324578
15101. he thought	she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand	go	1727.169421724921
15102. thank you she said dusting herself off	140.7784673880393
15103. will you play with us again miss langford	165.08132521147897
15104. one of the little	girls said	65.08547042953377
15105. maybe some other day	2.9644131047453928
15106. oh shucks the girl said	22.315831487065175
15107. i don't believe i'll	play any more neither	166.8559514047351
15108. me neither others said and soon	the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups	and alone	3043.0831675217387
15109. jack walked off alone out the road in the searing	midday sun past robert allen's three-room tarpapered house toward	the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what	he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after	school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw	the look in her eyes	5713.320149775548
15110. when he came back to the schoolhouse	his mind was made up	963.0032890922981
15111. he simply would not work his arithmetic problems	when the teacher held his class	941.0725491734099
15112. that should do it he thought because	miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school	work	2797.0943486674796
15113. he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone	or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he	couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher	probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay	in after school	4980.942437614851
15114. the only drawback now to the plan he'd	decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the	teacher would have that person stay late along with jack	5342.146212297686
15115. but	i've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately	780.047156425511
15116. to his surprise his plan worked perfectly	140.40719393514576
15117. all right if you	can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school	it out miss langford said firmly not smiling	2589.4983678343747
15118. you will	stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and	work your problems	2131.3860079657316
15119. and so when the others stampeded out that	afternoon	jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in	what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and	yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home	4672.079785456821
15120. his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was	trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened	child how will i do it	5191.022729010732
15121. on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a	young woman of remarkable beauty and poise	1728.0135382417568
15122. she munched little ginger	cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic	eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot	king snake wrapped around his bronze neck	5507.299850355969
15123. the youth with	the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman	1582.5711173319905
15124. lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light	color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave	women of his family	4280.234527364095
15125. the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished	hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: look	at your watch col garvier	2178.373268476855
15126. it is almost time for and calinda	to begin	391.40673596606837
15127. col henri garvier was one of new orleans'	most important and enlightened slave owners	938.9127824639551
15128. he chuckled and gave	the signal for the dance to start	754.7433870879713
15129. the slaves ran gaily to the center	of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny	no-name	1876.194784492224
15130. johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer	bones against the gourd which served as his drum	1652.0343640911713
15131. he showed his gleaming	tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling	discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy	2187.2166395656104
15132. the	drummer	flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda	a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners	and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds	5512.332823462513
15133. the	dance was of haitian origin	43.580852347220436
15134. the white girl with the penetrating	green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of	about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows	4476.456518344774
15135. he was possessive	in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a	fashion and imitated the manners of his owners	2333.857589677435
15136. he proudly wore the	blue livery of her house for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie	wife of the prominent surgeon dr louis lalaurie who bore one	of the south's oldest and most cherished names	5634.1681141896515
15137. delphine was	a pace-setter in high society	94.08854597685742
15138. she was a top horsewoman and one of	the city's most gracious hostesses	1185.5728083974896
15139. although new orleans was not	to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and	unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against	humanity ever committed on american soil	3950.1169643800945
15140. madame lalaurie	gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was	stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders	4084.160098101433
15141. the slender handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by	the other slaves	640.865895553131
15142. he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure	for women of any race	1643.3765669569748
15143. but dandy had had little experience with	girls on his master's plantation in bayou st john	1258.9662648192202
15144. shy	actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant	of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in	the open fields in carriages and in boathouses	4989.666001804873
15145. this young slave	was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled	that she wanted him to draw near	1569.0757804866687
15146. the woman eyed the youth with the	avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is	not yet in his collection	3695.9136248983777
15147. what is your name boy	14.896350174046185
15148. come	a bit closer	4.4311359505111625
15149. i won't bite you know	14.97854212998547
15150. he gaped at madame	lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her	1417.516324675258
15151. my name is dandy brandon missy	43.518071320663346
15152. i belong	to master alexander prieur	65.39521616352813
15153. she said with intense feeling:	come near let me feel your arms	640.711117668407
15154. you look quite strong and	healthy to me dandy	389.8494625253603
15155. mrs lalaurie impatiently propelled	the slave toward her waiting carriage	372.50093244737434
15156. lifting her skirts she climbed	in never relinquishing her grip on his arm	1176.8232715584386
15157. the woman seemed utterly	unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor	1263.7937542494337
15158. once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains	and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination	usually reserved for army inductees	4071.2174790253584
15159. satisfied at last and	after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that	dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called	to her liveried driver	3528.2533812114525
15160. this was the big man with the proprietory	air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows	1419.9760179534483
15161. aristide! i	want you	to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the	boy's purchase	1728.1316472206304
15162. there's $600 in gold in this chamois sack	247.80669477058467
15163. if the	old fool argues about the price tell him i shall order my husband	not to treat him as a patient any longer	2460.240551763353
15164. prieur has gout and depends	on louis' pills and bleedings	560.1848241144542
15165. besides he owns 300 slaves	14.859260079324326
15166. one	less shouldn't matter to him	65.43138287414918
15167. aristide devol the sardonic	manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native	sierra leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver	hat	2734.5316863704247
15168. his bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might	sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to	owner	3875.1502625869316
15169. another youth madame	0.20041515
15170. the coachman said softly	4.4141873885769325
15171. this one is a tender chicken oui	94.09095353135892
15172. such delicate beauty	such fine flesh	65.06267575006594
15173. it will rip and shred easily for madame	165.72422138304847
15174. be quiet devol! you are forgetting your place	252.4134390574963
15175. the	tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur	500.31347250710394
15176. delphine	lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy	brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion	at 677 perdido street	4460.320926843705
15177. dr louis lalaurie stood on the	veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached	the pillared mansion	2327.8011634865975
15178. dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions	peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle	1883.7804800067647
15179. he	saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large	head	1096.2684509809626
15180. dr lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic	eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses	2587.0490834322345
15181. he was	about 50 years old	43.999160451235824
15182. another young man my dear	22.04187545460343
15183. really	you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning	with displeasure	1102.275592940497
15184. delphine presented her cheek for a kiss	and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster	1885.4480608216193
15185. dandy is	to be our house guest louis	166.58041272104452
15186. i want the room in the attic prepared	for him he is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways	3056.9928352791057
15187. he	deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation	790.2652557082929
15188. his room will be ready shortly	64.69800778165985
15189. the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory	glance at the cringing slave	1261.5287681590314
15190. had dandy been older or wiser instinct	might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the	lalauries' tender care if he valued his life	4670.137663630392
15191. but he liked	the smell of delphine's perfume	166.36931619395665
15192. besides her endearments and caresses	in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple	youth	2351.3038747532264
15193. also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony	260.2891537228989
15194. so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine	lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to	be his new home	4284.618017964388
15195. airless and dingy though it was the attic represented	luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and	sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st john	3661.455049777915
15196. he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted	when madame lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the	slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber	5168.186705836799
15197. it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the	hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell	2713.466785719775
15198. when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street he was	carried out in a coroner's basket	2351.1930413332793
15199. just six weeks after	dandy brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and	his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which	only new orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited	3866.675457081171
15200. a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and delphine	circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the	forthcoming races the latest fashions from paris and louisiana	politics	4823.610087366227
15201. suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing	boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians	and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase	3468.7032216926027
15202. it was dandy brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth	emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him	3283.4748876521758
15203. the	lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts	639.7281547974197
15204. his pinched	face showed the ravages of malnutrition	252.26628022625346
15205. feebly he pointed an	accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted: evil woman!	you did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h i want h	to go home	3458.859849233898
15206. these were the last words he ever uttered	249.08926894315832
15207. convulsively	he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator	gaston berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician	wore	2474.716256155837
15208. dr louis lalaurie examined the inert form of	the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead	2604.3190090645953
15209. the ball	broke up in confusion	43.302822267022755
15210. guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie	and made speedy departures	757.5758837905212
15211. delphine stood like stone	her eyes alive	with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse	1422.966687062828
15212. but at	the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story	559.6701270077904
15213. i	saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry	for him	1100.9229737975588
15214. it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom	when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who	seemed worthy of our interest	5162.539724650649
15215. after i paid monsieur prieur for	dandy i brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the	same night	2328.1247495844
15216. how he returned in such a ghastly condition or why i	cannot say	1181.5004199697644
15217. dr lalaurie and i didn't even know he was in the	house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs	2470.390790970862
15218. she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said	with obvious emotion: that poor boy! he must have fallen in	with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and	inexperienced	5904.179678636754
15219. ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing	him back to our house to die	1262.3780167240686
15220. such a pitiful end!   though	the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's	panel dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury	and disregarded	4326.947470903588
15221. the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder	and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity	of so illustrious a lady	2876.3124092455823
15222. moreover runaway slaves frequently got into	serious trouble in new orleans' dives	961.8913186584529
15223. so the verict was	death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite	of the city accepting delphine's testimony welcomed her and the	doctor back into the fold	3449.4813364467327
15224. once again life went its serene way- soirees	fox hunts balls and dinners	1182.5401867590676
15225. the excitement over brandon's	bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie's stock soared when	she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing	cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital	3640.285979459597
15226. then	on july 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to	wagging at a furious clip	2114.553055896154
15227. mrs victor dominique socially	prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries chanced to glance out of	her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight	2990.073586091553
15228. the	manservant devol and his mistress delphine lalaurie were pursuing	a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front	lawn of the lalaurie mansion	4103.258062574765
15229. the girl was not more than 16	93.53306842608258
15230. she	was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not	conceal the knife slashes on her back	3249.938937389442
15231. the bleeding girl was	tiring fast; the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced	down perdido street	1879.9290086863452
15232. the fugitive cried out in an oddly	sibilant voice: help me somebody! they have pulled out all	my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw!	bastards he would say all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi	stuff and the first chair clobbered me! since then and	since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and	even indecent- group from greenwich village to the embarcadero	he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper	0.30166232349522504
15233. there ain't	nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball	freight	when you wanna go someplace feathertop would say	2045.9447038612784
15234. the accommodations	may not be the poshest but man! there ain't nobody	askin' for your	ticket stub neither	2344.15235367091
15235. he had been conning	the freights for a long long time now	642.5403643936962
15236. ever since the hooch and the	trouble with the quartet and midge and the child	1654.2294008175443
15237. it had been a very long time that had no form and no end	946.445630108404
15238. he was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer	his own- riding the dark train out	3038.944894702917
15239. out and out and never to return	again	166.28962520798845
15240. till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint	had been killed the last beat had been rapped	3060.3293122856476
15241. that was the day it	ended	43.24901239209192
15242. the freight car was cold early in the morning	390.9867215790167
15243. he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks	the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering	the sound of his ocarina	3455.0606846012183
15244. he held his elbows away from his	body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled	its tune-belly	3292.1333553587856
15245. the train slowed at a road crossing and	the big door slid open; at first gratingly caught by grains of corn-	then with a clash into its slot	2988.3182564543067
15246. the boy lifted the girl	by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor	2129.498700948419
15247. she pulled her legs	up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and	feathertop's music pffft-ed away	2161.317514362106
15248. now that is a very nice	a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner	2139.987248364011
15249. a	little thing but the right twist for the action that counted	641.8775774287242
15250. hot	that was the word hot! hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's	wings with the sun shining down over them	2613.4846386457452
15251. a poet yet! his thoughts	for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and	the long legs were less than poetic however	2603.9047194359327
15252. zingggg-o!	then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last	moment so he landed sitting	1882.4880337709153
15253. he was less to see but feathertop	took him in too just to keep the records straight	1418.4950272072613
15254. curly	hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's	blocky hands and a body that said well maybe i can wrestle you for	ten minutes- but then i'm finished	5013.857023759574
15255. we made it cappy	the chick said	93.96088742548224
15256. yeah seems so don't it the boy	laughed hugging her close	752.5643014293469
15257. ah-ah! feathertop interrupted	standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants	786.5260444846639
15258. we run a respectable house here	65.32046969081622
15259. they whirled	and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded	freight wall	1429.1476699198743
15260. he was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of	the flapping tops of his shoes	2113.327014356239
15261. he held the black plastic kazoo lightly	92.9937698876189
15262. come sit said feathertop motioning them toward	him	250.24961668588577
15263. that crap is softer over here	43.674119726937114
15264. the girl smiled and	started forward	65.07082825205484
15265. the boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her	feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm	1875.9769976636367
15266. now stay	with me kitty he snapped irritably	250.13293494353738
15267. i vowed to take care of	you- and that's what i'm gonna do	789.5327570270961
15268. we don't know this guy	22.071468510933833
15269. oooo square bit feathertop screwed his face up	166.62731586639148
15270. this	guy was strictly from outsville	65.66865483688795
15271. but nowhere!   what	is with this vow jazz	166.55639152258172
15272. feathertop inquired lounging against	the freight's vibrating wall	252.38205283498888
15273. we- we eloped cappy	said	14.840205111509906
15274. his head came up and he said it defiantly	390.50666957333704
15275. feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand	165.6314473210652
15276. these two were going to be easy pickins	248.81134268355362
15277. they couldn't have much	dough but then none of the freight-bums feathertop rolled had	much	1090.9293775977271
15278. and besides the chick had a little something the others didn't	have	965.1787731562424
15279. that was gonna be fun collecting!   but not just	yet	371.7793301231632
15280. he liked to savor his meat before	he tasted it	555.445612319434
15281. come sit he repeated motioning to the piled	hay bags over the pig leavings	942.6301923561596
15282. i'm just a poor ex-jazz man name	of- uh- boyd smith	753.9870217602614
15283. he grinned at them wolfishly	14.838888325712205
15284. that ain't your name mister the boy accused	251.40382365636225
15285. and	you know- you're right! feathertop aimed a finger at	him	503.42961125321546
15286. oh come on cappy the girl chided	141.6383813423691
15287. she started to move toward the hay bags	dragging the reluctant cappy behind her	945.1258962671598
15288. feathertop watched	the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags	and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle	4652.064399639934
15289. he cleared his throat; it had been a long hot while since he'd	seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance	2191.4540565618395
15290. he had it all doped of course	140.82572325468368
15291. slug the kid grab his dough- at least	enough to get to philadelphia- and then have a rockin' ball	with the doll	2170.7170348132304
15292. hmm- diddle!   where'd you come from	mr- uh- mr smith	566.3399897223472
15293. kitty inquired politely	0.20041515
15294. out	0.30041514999999996
15295. i been riding train for a ways	now	166.99605131266918
15296. they lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up	a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself	3064.6275059593418
15297. after a while kitty murmured something to cappy and he held	her close answering we'll just have to wait till we pull into	philly honey	2586.2828738101252
15298. what's the matter she wanna go the	bathroom	253.2488971901243
15299. ernie found it immensely funny	14.969296046157098
15300. the boy scowled	at him and the girl looked shocked	567.2508867858767
15301. no! certainly not	i mean no that isn't what i said! she snapped at him	1095.498525311291
15302. i only said i was hungry	64.67122331772234
15303. we haven't had anything to eat all	day	165.9458175943435
15304. joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill's voice	as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with	leather handles	2816.2296139247583
15305. whyn't ya say so fellow travelers! why we	got dinner right here	639.2881560952123
15306. c'mon buddy help me set up the kitchen and	we'll have food in a minute or two	2121.6926364113474
15307. cappy looked wary	but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to	the center of the refuse-littered boxcar	2046.3134313672545
15308. ernie crouched and	opened the carpet bag	140.49902178592265
15309. he took out a small packet filled with bits of	charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book	of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with	holes in it	4124.378379258453
15310. he put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the	matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot	3911.681803481385
15311. a charcoal pit man he said indicating the	slightly-smoking	makeshift brazier	503.2308278276852
15312. fan it he told cappy handing him	a sheet of newspaper	752.6081635747353
15313. yeah but what're we gonna eat	43.11632918860228
15314. charcoal	0.30041514999999996
15315. fella ernie waggled a dirty finger at	the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience	1100.3488860580226
15316. he reached	once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners	1651.5183099937797
15317. not the greatest but they stick to your belly	insides	372.27482458170937
15318. he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid	three dogs on the tin foil	1422.5033972908757
15319. almost immediately they began to sizzle	43.21581917304485
15320. he looked up and grinned	22.255458340147086
15321. a kroger's self-serve he	explained	14.855259757975332
15322. when they had licked the	last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back	and cappy offered ernie a cigarette	3279.294172991441
15323. nice kid ernie thought	too bad	43.473252297680745
15324. how come you're riding the rods kids like you	394.5199595698637
15325. ernie asked	0.20041515
15326. cappy looked down at his wide hands and	did not reply	748.1950976580467
15327. but surprisingly kitty's face came up and she said	my father	502.14140169036244
15328. he didn't want us to get married	139.0780185600023
15329. why didn't he want you to get hitched	166.6093398491527
15330. this time even she did not answer	139.1684192236876
15331. she looked down at her hands too	93.25985471966098
15332. after a few seconds she said dad didn't like cappy	561.7388361377427
15333. cappy's head came around sharply	14.80836266266794
15334. your fault	hell! it was all my fault	247.68873774732896
15335. if i'd been careful it never woulda-	he stopped abruptly	373.49511343991173
15336. what's	the matter	0.30041514999999996
15337. the girl still did not raise her	eyes but she added simply i'm pregnant	934.590052699946
15338. oh he was stupid her old man! you never heard nothin'	like it: kitty's gonna go have an abortion and kitty's	gonna go away to a convent and kitty's this and kitty's that h	like he was nuts or somethin' y'know	6501.215957521704
15339. ernie nodded	0.20041515
15340. this was a slightly different matter	65.44913126223824
15341. he remembered midge and the	child	43.654776099189256
15342. but that had been a time before all this a time he didn't	think about	1644.4698101887109
15343. a time before the white lightning and the bumming had	turned him inside out	949.4905408251676
15344. but these kids weren't like him	65.36275560894377
15345. oh	crap! he thought pull out of it old son	369.3526381683529
15346. these are just another	couple of characters to roll	387.67245127277135
15347. what they got you get	14.85317479301833
15348. now forget	all this other	22.142930284225674
15349. wanna drink	0.20041515
15350. ernie offered taking	the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket	959.1208864754901
15351. the answer came from the open door of the boxcar	377.0380460503846
15352. from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train	had slowed on the grade	2840.7762110956296
15353. ernie stared at the man	14.832092065175013
15354. real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like	a grizzly	1648.6308256002474
15355. you gonna give	me a drink fella	94.0376235502474
15356. the big man asked again taking a step into the	boxcar	763.0505784217762
15357. this character could break	him in half	93.24574830830342
15358. sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips	755.7747299301416
15359. he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered	the remainder	639.9680714888594
15360. the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy	on the wooden flooring	1187.0002023969696
15361. he took the bottle with undue belligerence	and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely	1567.499395119031
15362. he threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously	756.8610431117708
15363. he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the	open door	946.0145094014526
15364. well now he said and reached into his pocket	392.16638029070526
15365. i didn't know i was gonna have company in this car	499.46990374356375
15366. we're going to philadelphia kitty said pulling her skirt	down around her legs all the more	1880.947968846764
15367. no i don't think	so said the big man and it was the final clincher for ernie	1416.0764082304727
15368. he	had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it	1399.6961291467064
15369. maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere	640.845314146952
15370. he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked	electricity in the car	1413.19780902064
15371. ernie was screaming inside himself: no	damn you you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me!	the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand	to her mouth	3431.8905845359136
15372. her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied	by the rattling of the freight and then cappy came off the floor	his legs driving him hard	4490.679184036985
15373. the kid hit the bigger man with an audible	thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle	1582.7305879815262
15374. they	went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but	flailing arms and legs	3040.0581496300997
15375. the kid showed for an instant and his	arm was cocked back	640.6334086372495
15376. the fist went down into the pile of flesh and	ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go aaawww!	then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the	same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade	6956.339395537844
15377. he held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough	to press the stud	946.0566627605358
15378. the blade came out with a snick! he fisted	the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat	3290.615736205969
15379. kitty screamed insanely and her face was white	166.50702940296702
15380. she grabbed	at feathertop's sleeve and shrieked help him! help him!	do something!	they neither liked nor disliked the old man	3058.5162119519327
15381. to them he could	have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and	after mass and at noon and at six each evening- its tone repetitive	monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets	4041.300018942733
15382. the old	man was unimportant	22.02022603668049
15383. yet if he were not there they would have	missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against	the screen door in early june; or the smell of thick tomato paste-	the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from	aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth	5135.560848965207
15384. or the surging whirling	sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness	above and below the amber street lights	3714.176390928123
15385. or the bay of female	dogs in heat	166.26987842402696
15386. they never called him by name although he had	one	567.3991180992764
15387. filippo rossi that's what he was called in the old country;	but here he was just signore or the old man	2032.2804440495468
15388. but this was	not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance	from its elders	2588.168718151698
15389. it went to church	on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession	944.3643217287047
15390. but youth	asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given	in passing	2593.177972754688
15391. the only thing unusual about the old man had	long since happened	642.291582154098
15392. but the past was dead here as the present was dead	755.6437805560743
15393. once the old man had had a wife	168.37571379428596
15394. and once she too ignored him	65.72459515853475
15395. with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her	satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop	2032.9181193503996
15396. in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw	suitcase	1888.2983678902194
15397. the way she strutted down the street the old man would	have been blind not to have noticed both	1738.5688206713517
15398. without looking at him	without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of	her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in	it and never came back	5321.905475535691
15399. but she shouldn't have come here	in the first place the women had said	947.8113681220042
15400. she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from	torino	1182.2122662885404
15401. eh torino! she gave herself fancy airs!	just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought	she could carry her head higher than ours	3230.7471218854903
15402. they had slapped	their thighs	22.33793038456693
15403. it's not for making pretty speeches about dante	those actresses get paid so good	942.3219775436537
15404. henh! calloused	fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had	swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted	never to be tweezed away	4280.947278383772
15405. mauve-colored mouths that had never known	anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's	tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again	3117.546544132607
15406. puttana!	but if the old man even thought about his wife	now nobody cared a fig	1899.6971246742996
15407. it was enough for people to know that at	one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman	he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the	distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner	4770.735891904996
15408. his	voice had not commanded her to stop	248.76241295826694
15409. it had not questioned why	14.738686785531948
15410. the	women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell; but he	might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog	onto him	4475.683448590383
15411. and his eyes- those miniature	sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression	or direction	1256.832799563633
15412. the old man's very soul could have left him and	flown down that street but he wouldn't have had anyone know it	3284.706297014052
15413. perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come	from and where it was taking his wife	1884.4981284384498
15414. but when he called for his	withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had	he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of	her climbing into that streetcar	5914.0840350985345
15415. there seemed to be a contemptuous	purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel	street and his back in opposition to the church behind him	3220.1623198634
15416. for all	he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the	outskirts of philadelphia	3051.0091906215052
15417. it could have been bari or chieti for	the way it smelled	643.905308031188
15418. what did it matter to him that the park at the foot	of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the	stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals	5191.1199956037835
15419. or	that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the	schuylkill	642.5086545781926
15420. this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion	in his aloneness	1890.4721474529579
15421. to him they were one and the same	167.46800540925034
15422. sameness	for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided	these quarters from the city	3051.0942566919666
15423. sameness lined the streets with two-story	houses the color of ash	501.920871697245
15424. it slashed the sloping manure-scented	lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches	1878.7591046210923
15425. it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges	of screen doors	1105.299291958729
15426. even the stable-garage which housed nothing	now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it	2131.5713880593485
15427. and the coffee shop	on drexel street where the men spent their evenings and sundays	playing cards had a rose hedge beneath its window	2474.5656663176665
15428. the hedge reeked	of coffee dregs thrown against it	388.36568670551947
15429. only one house on the street	had no lawn before it	505.9003284470559
15430. it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk	with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade	2125.9618588596923
15431. above it from a second-story showroom wooden angels surveyed	the neighborhood	501.01996271722044
15432. did the old man remember them there	139.73182177426014
15433. yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks-	like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill rising with	the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery	3952.575073209715
15434. only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses	into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards	owned no fences where one man's property blended with the next	to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy	6480.827863685276
15435. love and hatred and	fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines	1266.441154318833
15436. and the	forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to	back porch	1887.0294253088246
15437. the old man silently fed upon these streets	167.35179880151102
15438. they	kept him alive waiting	22.238550083078778
15439. waiting for what and for whom only he could	tell and would not	793.523640413789
15440. it was as though he had made a pact with the	devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price	3476.9879416378108
15441. he was holding	out for something	43.230276276047974
15442. he was determined to hold out	65.01089463846662
15443. the old	man's son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step	taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich	2987.110316792144
15444. at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother that he couldn't	remember her face or her touch; neither did he care that aunt rose	provided for him	4657.81013097795
15445. he was named pompeii as a tribute to his	heritage and he couldn't have cared less about that either	1731.1985559127031
15446. to him	life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended	only with sleep	2362.2801260824353
15447. when he would be a man he would be a rich	man	642.9241895388925
15448. he would not be like the rich americans who lived in white-columned	houses on the other side of the park	2814.07088048225
15449. he would not ride the	eight-thirty local to the city each morning	639.0374880802362
15450. he would not carry a brief	case	141.24876024406856
15451. nor would he work at all	43.49237339226177
15452. he would square his shoulders and	carry a cane before each step	963.4947944966273
15453. he would sit inside the coffee shop	and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and	come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at	your service	3848.6745689871595
15454. he would order her to bring coffee and would take	from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would	not remove his gloves- and light and smoke	5187.498196726784
15455. he could do that when	he would be a man	373.8344947999125
15456. hey laura! he called to his sister	on the porch above the steps	1183.5454894544496
15457. she was only ten months older than	he	166.52893057170928
15458. laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe	567.0302172462335
15459. laura	did not answer him	14.797243025906052
15460. she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch	fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun	2360.885356761062
15461. one lithe	leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking	torn pales	945.7648100405893
15462. her tanned foot whose arch swept high and white pointed	artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers whose tips glowed	white	3060.430353747291
15463. all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her	chest	784.2851472633217
15464. her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii	389.5704070974266
15465. it	was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to	fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines	of its contours	3097.1055762521273
15466. the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed	a sullen quality	751.6092718938758
15467. even though the boy could not see them he knew	they were clouded by distance	1093.4515146665085
15468. he was never sure they fully took	him in	389.55859441553787
15469. pompeii called again laura! but the only answer	that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg	moving against it	2457.4251367623283
15470. she's in a mood he thought there's	not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood	2109.1661187490176
15471. well	what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams	to dream about	1403.647644778664
15472. and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one	nobody would stop him	1662.2146416391074
15473. suddenly he was interrupted	in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin	and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue	feasting against the salt taste of him	3953.955679910304
15474. above the tongue an aged	yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized	pink skin stared unfalteringly at him	3274.5022968058106
15475. christ sake	goat git! but the goat would not	263.5424630174099
15476. you're boiling	milk ain't you	22.36645777559756
15477. soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered	jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly	to his touch	2022.4844320768493
15478. his head undulated gradually covering	space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth	of those teats	2597.3247237694736
15479. with his mouth opened wide he squirted the warm	white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light	earthy taste of it	2851.2626481125762
15480. the boy's fingers and mouth operated with	the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting	in what he did	3254.294482116441
15481. above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm	cloud	376.62463351766314
15482. its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane	562.5757057058579
15483. but the	boy could see only the goat's belly	264.7186367810433
15484. the old man near the	corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in	it	2135.5512849247216
15485. he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldn't	raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back	2452.063941029767
15486. there would	be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the	devil his due	2109.8169347088174
15487. time enough to give up his soul	94.15981613597661
15488. in the meantime	six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeii's shaved	hair edged up close to him	2822.454929339039
15489. the clapping they made on the concrete	interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly	released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches	for ticks	3644.8506990994474
15490. he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals	belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones	to romeo concetta's idiot brother	4092.7996782984437
15491. pompeii expected romeo's	small body to sink closer and closer to the ground	786.8942604149368
15492. he expected concetta's	thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and her shrill impetuous	voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that	was never sure of hearing anything	5305.5968001502
15493. people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it	942.6221271940097
15494. the room filled with smoke and maggie's head throbbed with excitement	and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud	possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to	quench it	5938.463992718602
15495. little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery	164.9777049452967
15496. in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz	of flaxen hair all over her head	2823.3763234035973
15497. she stopped flying into rages and	started digesting her food; she developed a peaches and cream complexion	and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life	than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food	at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity	going on around her	5470.584773210142
15498. she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook	from lifting her and taking care of her	1880.6503152001812
15499. maggie couldn't seem	to	get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do:	there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety	old washer and lugged out and lugged back; there was the daily round	of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating	5189.627881231915
15500. worry	had a great deal to do with it; stuart had been laid off at the	produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office	taking what salary his father could hand out to him	6219.265647700698
15501. mr clifton	would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with	his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's	upkeep and besides that there were the things that had to be bought	for the baby	milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap just plain soap	5023.162433113929
15502. maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how	they could squeeze out a few pennies more	2813.3495200421053
15503. in desperation maggie	consulted eugenia one afternoon: do you think you could	find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could	still watch the baby and do the rest of the things	4154.356633163157
15504. it	seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said	1411.556361412699
15505. she	had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to	the stove and back again	1743.504433898827
15506. i have plenty of odd moments when	i could be doing something maggie said	1411.2942869806404
15507. it would make me	feel a lot better but the woman's exchange isn't taking baked goods	any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she	isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery	4407.415914015166
15508. i should think so eugenia said	65.21460412217488
15509. for one thing	you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the	skin out nineteen times a day	2178.759923426743
15510. she's so beautiful	and i do like to keep her looking nice	965.7902672118768
15511. she picked	up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck	640.9379933353265
15512. she'll	be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed	eugenia said	1632.3061863850605
15513. evadna mae evans said she didn't put a thing on	her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old	2172.5997737682105
15514. evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best's liliputian	bazaar in new york and i'm sick and tired of hearing about	evadna mae evans	4096.343493998639
15515. well now maggie you don't	have to snap at me eugenia said	637.3964043752619
15516. i'm just thinking of a way	for you to be sensible	750.9436326139039
15517. i do seem to snap	at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make	a little extra money	2460.6933061934205
15518. let's make	a list of your assets	140.02640138050276
15519. maggie started laughing and she laughed	so hard she couldn't stop and she kept on laughing while she lugged	the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still	shining	3743.557318257176
15520. when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table	with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures	3058.7192341144237
15521. i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working	mothers	eugenia said	1417.924421738729
15522. we could put up cribs on the second floor	sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's	nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of running	up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that	7348.536238032335
15523. what else	0.20041515
15524. you might set up a dress	shop in the	living room	756.2893329407788
15525. every woman in the block has tried that	167.43602249802998
15526. what about a tea room then	65.10322829477002
15527. you could set up tables	in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread	and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes	3110.1841325467312
15528. and grandma isn't strong enough to take	on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i	2813.6079475895117
15529. she said well those are the really interesting	things but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some	of my extra typing jobs to you if you think you can type well enough	3962.347700482568
15530. oh i'm sure i could do that maggie said	393.43082457330627
15531. but	it really wouldn't be fair taking your jobs away from you	643.4042032798478
15532. don't worry i can get plenty more eugenia said wondering	where in the world she could	1892.1291626576815
15533. maggie was looking much happier	already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could	put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing	so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it	4037.167583232179
15534. and then whenever i have	a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the	stove at the same time	4284.071104306184
15535. and i can go back to my contests and be thinking	while i'm doing the washing	1263.3789084036757
15536. what are you going	to do with your feet so you don't waste anything	1410.9595543762237
15537. maggie	laughed	0.20041515
15538. she said oh eugenia i wish h   what	250.6425573923529
15539. i wish i had three wishes maggie said	166.70808889348035
15540. all	of them for you	22.323821799865243
15541. it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november	contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people	1559.58600192109
15542. the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during	the days	1643.2861640206163
15543. the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile	high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and	altered its physical appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism	resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of	the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal	sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and	resources	5851.782021902598
15544. the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment	offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines	outside government agencies	3031.8510880738377
15545. there weren't facilities to take care	of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities	1563.7751406260454
15546. that	kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east	which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested	populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected	by discriminatory freight rates	5619.503981578831
15547. the east was popularly supposed	to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west	along; and now the east was creating government agencies for which	the west doubtless would have to pay	3876.4120372000784
15548. the government offices	were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile	the cold penetrated everything	2558.730929791673
15549. shivering people talked and	argued; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow	but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate	remedies and something had to be done	3559.70591711936
15550. something had to be done;	it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal	problems no less urgent than those of the government	4087.5391300508186
15551. something	had to be done	14.882713461551026
15552. the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times	a day	962.4298159477696
15553. something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills	the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making	money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half	soles for overshoes	for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas	and light bills; about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting	the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day	0.20124717349522497
15554. just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe	and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major	disaster	4106.786027677949
15555. the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant	ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its	evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained	cold	4038.7694846654995
15556. cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung	up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping	porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the	roof	5353.777095899959
15557. presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity	and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been	removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and	an electric heater in grandma's room	4548.263921651202
15558. it was so cold and so wretched	that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people	stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance	so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only	important thing was to cling together and survive	7490.139395752785
15559. the pipes	burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while	they swabbed the bathrooms	1871.3752268047233
15560. they lived mainly in the kitchen; they	moved maggie's bed and the baby's basket there and the rest of	them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper	polar regions and plunged into icy beds	6201.612343850769
15561. grandma said it was just	like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live	only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she	used to	3857.563675281747
15562. you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly	140.96482079952398
15563. eugenia	hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to	find the joys of poverty wearing thin	1723.0525915959
15564. she said to maggie that it was	one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was	beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever	5459.544171823415
15565. plenty of people are poor all their lives	166.63701244681033
15566. plenty of	people haven't our brains and talent	252.6290100353624
15567. i know you when	you start talking about brains and talent maggie said	796.0353176541382
15568. you're	working up to something and if you don't watch out you'll ruin	your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy	family is superior to everything even a depression	5493.917997803781
15569. the	only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it eugenia	said	1087.02154308964
15570. they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen	for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange	beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in	privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia	than it would have to be that way	8457.235638754719
15571. she didn't want to be the only	one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly	run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater	3449.4005374023604
15572. hope wouldn't	hear of it and she took the heater back to grandma's room	and grandma took it back to hope's room and the two of them dragged	it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her	bedspread on fire	6787.370462739986
15573. she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted	with a fire in her room and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody	knowing it	2852.553031574438
15574. eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the	heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth	and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldn't have	the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in	6794.663707178448
15575. thrifty of her to use it up	92.82232714046219
15576. unusual in a case like this	but-   you can joke! didn't you read it	1414.8900992085541
15577. she's	married that tenant!   i read it yes	166.6771931979435
15578. this ought	to simplify tolley's life	64.94792126533302
15579. laban had more to say	14.783956782517075
15580. tolley	had gone to live in california	140.4543543664614
15581. he'd mentioned it himself	at church	and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny	had jilted him for roy robards	2602.9838337842302
15582. it was plain as the nose	on your face that they're laughing about it mamma	1638.3143457409553
15583. zion stayed	to get my pin but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back	1577.5902556296305
15584. we will both go back laban! kizzie turned to go inside	758.5591104362006
15585. let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma	374.69009659026665
15586. the sun's	right-   pictures	4.410188483856113
15587. she swung around	0.20041515
15588. what	pictures	0.30041514999999996
15589. in brace's room! you told me to	bring my camera	373.4149999077524
15590. i'm not going back-   indeed you are!	why should i want pictures of an empty room now	2129.3351113345407
15591. tolley	had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny! this- trip of	his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going	to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact	4028.351452706343
15592. wait for me laban i'll be dressed in half a second!	frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back	3458.9003452993697
15593. hurry frank! they're not going to laugh at the	fairbrothers and labans very long! tolley's going is my	fault	1724.5873417458556
15594. you know it and i'll tell everybody	exactly how it happened	745.0594660977091
15595. she was so beautiful so valiant	so pitiable	167.23453373794285
15596. make your confession to god kizzie	dear not to the congregation	751.2623641879879
15597. i'll decide that when	i get there	93.02771551821544
15598. i was so cruel to tolley so unfair	249.6419277434489
15599. but i'll	be fair now! he is coming back isn't he frank	645.6006081891186
15600. yes oh yes	0.30041514999999996
15601. what else was there to say	43.227216614456815
15602. returning to the log-house	he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips:	under the window in stormy weather   i marry this man	and woman together	4468.349295074269
15603. let none but him who rules the thunder	put this man and woman asunder	946.4932952293287
15604. absolution for his lie	4.403138235295725
15605. he questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message but	he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its	pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it	3220.1437599641445
15606. if he died before she	did she would never be unable to resist opening it	1636.232159296911
15607. in any case he	would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons making them parties	to a deception peculiarly his own	2191.5862475115873
15608. it was simply his necessity	to confess which had made him write and keep this thing	1888.0239454528987
15609. you've	told god frank he said	43.429257613713716
15610. why lacerate the- congregation	4.440816363585876
15611. reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore	the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little	pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling	in the feathery ash	4219.087479497215
15612. surely now his beloved son could rest in peace	392.16689386953414
15613. 'and let me go for the night gathers me and in the	night shall no man gather fruit'	1579.4495773497229
15614. a beautiful and haunting line	a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and	perhaps he did h	3017.9388010280604
15615. but there were great satisfactions even for	a small man	374.68557684862697
15616. beyond his window were the greening trees new spring	eternal hope eternal life	1178.7950914130047
15617. there lay grand fair's quinzaine	his own young parents' graves but new life and promise for his sons	grandsons	1730.7178898193092
15618. he poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made	so often	1181.646039663211
15619. but this last time he drank not	to brace but to tolley!	mr robards- jenny	was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood	who called him that- was kind but too easygoing	3825.6641382385087
15620. it didn't bother	him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy	miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her	3893.5686316512233
15621. he could put a stop to it she told him again and again	786.7567348610066
15622. simply	call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pg	and c'un major frank	1181.8240351017498
15623. mr robards laughed said he'd	feel a damn fool plain-out couldn't do that even to please her	1417.209295487515
15624. and if i ever hear you say 'mist	laban' again i'll scream	963.0317675459603
15625. and don't tell me you didn't	at church sunday	261.11673152252274
15626. i heard you!   he really hadn't	meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance	of these small things was lost on mr robards	4615.733198230918
15627. how strange it was	that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its	beautiful furnishings and fail her in- spiritual ways	2726.35561564821
15628. another	weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking which	he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse	of tolley's	4265.609763522464
15629. but mr robards' now	oh my yes indeed yes! he called her the mare much as mrs	whipsnade spoke of the queen god bless her	2602.630889973826
15630. h he with	fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there	in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin'	mare the revolting gunny	4862.3625476302095
15631. for the first few months of their	marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him	to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall	3426.354435620558
15632. and what had happened	4.4017661697452395
15633. gunny invariably tried to bite her	43.05625116199072
15634. nerves	mr robards said just a nip anyway	251.958783004566
15635. stand back miss jen	she's oneasy of your scarf	261.236109796887
15636. never quit that you sor'l	devil! never concern for his wife's nerves or the danger	that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in	january	5021.562210389993
15637. she musn't annoy gunny whose foal was due then	too!   listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist	fair's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing	triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession	of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with	an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it	5700.546548099046
15638. gunny symbolized	so much that was unpleasant- tolley the indifference with which	the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her	and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack	of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting	swollen stomach	7107.883999303575
15639. human birth was no novelty to mr robards	167.34590798916975
15640. tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested	959.5778336960835
15641. jenny's aversion to having dr dunne a former admirer seemed	silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best	never being too good for her	3220.8019483489197
15642. the chances were against his	being here to humor her when her time came she was sure	2109.9062151749595
15643. he would be	in the barn or riding for the veterinarian! night after night he	stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of	expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte	russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come	to the house	5305.720571616129
15644. yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here	in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when	it was all over as any husband could have been	5636.479380988616
15645. jenny wished	now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldn't	have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets	2330.724420783172
15646. there was something	not nice about triplets though their father seemed pleased showing	no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted saying	you don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day	miss jen hon	5915.4535894909295
15647. rhyme 'em up cute- arcilla flotilla h	edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself	and-   kezziah for miss kizzie he suggested	2460.4116912459976
15648. she	was mighty good to you past times an' this'll fetch her	959.9149644150206
15649. now	she must be thinking of a boy-name something special	374.7981111103025
15650. just wait till	she saw the mare's foal	252.4572267903461
15651. handsomest colt in all kentucky	14.720256824919227
15652. strong	too up on his legs when he was an hour old	966.1152071494178
15653. what about royal robards	2.9572256626587112
15654. why don't you name him jesus christ!	she burst into tears	756.1564968249324
15655. he'd had	no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been	500.69201108432037
15656. of course she wasn't	herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didn't	seem to rise with it	3038.4685051153624
15657. he had a good idea why not	92.90123472612196
15658. those elegant at	home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes	again and had the house all trimmed up hadn't brought many callers	in two whole months	5009.5620858522625
15659. doc dunne and miss sis had come	93.6070966228307
15660. so	had miss shawnee rakestraw full of criticisms about the changes here	giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly	rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town	in inclement weather was looking forward to quinzaine spa this summer	7169.568974721321
15661. miss kizzie had been right snippy	ever since they were married though you'd have thought a namesake	would	have brought her round	2168.83965637866
15662. oh she'd come to see them once left silver	teething rings for all of the trips	1869.1363173645896
15663. but when miss jen went over	right away to return the call miss kiz couldn't have been very	cordial for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there	3317.3115928414472
15664. more and more these days she'd been driving that pretty little	mare that looked like her over to tillie's and nick's- his own	old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the	house everybody friendly inside making a to-do over the babies dressed	like dollies	7341.571867915702
15665. though he was glad she got on well with his young folks	she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too	2604.243246001057
15666. it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss sis	had given him to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved	for this summer and next if you please and that much as	she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs robards and	the children	7855.3074790918345
15667. she hoped they were well	14.695901827635103
15668. he didn't tell miss	jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course	knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit	4659.015181913053
15669. if he ever	did such a thing again she'd die of shame	641.0678559413038
15670. have a	party an' leave 'em out hon he suggested	558.1000228836934
15671. a swell party	send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met	at the galt house the ones i've got to know in this new jockey	club affair the whole dang neighborhood	3666.314466213053
15672. we'll have oystchers-	couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time	961.1812053141159
15673. i'll see	word gets round	14.812729815510897
15674. don't you dare!   miss	jen was	funny that way funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and	perk up	3245.7069676518686
15675. he was downright worried about her but there was one more	thing he could try h	1259.1142657020798
15676. zion was surprised when roy's buggy	stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking	home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers	had had a call to preach in some mountain town	6685.536917005202
15677. roy smiled-	he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely	told her to hop in and he'd give her a lift to quinzaine	2860.2904888421594
15678. her hesitation	was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it as she	settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were	getting on	4275.146606851096
15679. see for yourself miss zion	14.730849053670402
15680. it won't take	a minute	22.301461355617793
15681. he swung in through his own wide gateway	166.8255360364356
15682. them's	the purtiest babes you ever did see but miss jen gets mighty lonesome	1402.5941078122717
15683. she'll relish the sight of a friendly face	168.1078020275898
15684. miss kiz won't	care your comin' will she	250.8132418093081
15685. why of course not zion	said uncomfortably	93.12524855051042
15686. he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room	563.30513316991
15687. the absolution of doaty's last will and testament was proof enough	of that; doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman	2459.5317976277124
15688. she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty	she was running away that she had left something more behind her	than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin	5490.739660699959
15689. perhaps doaty	had guessed already and kept her counsel	261.1213587858903
15690. henrietta thought it's	extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us	1174.6747506713787
15691. there	had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable	940.8851112788709
15692. adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently	tempted	1183.56730234767
15693. their childhood would have been quite circumspect without	hetty's flair for drama especially through the long summers	1403.15743215968
15694. in	winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught	excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge; there had	been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really	profound distaste for his pupils; there had been the dancing class-	miss craddock thin and tireless with her supervising wand and her	everlasting one-two-three one-two-three	8344.710180338287
15695. there had been supper	parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty	and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun	around	which the blackwell planets revolved	3337.3612343624386
15696. mama had died before	the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles	1413.350454567694
15697. it was safe to assume that papa sighing heavily had said many times	to his remaining daughter thank god your poor mother was spared	this and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta	to leave with her hand in charles' hand just because	her poor	mother was gone already and would never know	5380.156970644112
15698. mama was vulnerable;	one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her	1888.6369872278678
15699. but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta	166.9584852649281
15700. she had always	been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no	choice	1878.1386712463282
15701. only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and	she was lying in doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others	might regard her	2705.705540477675
15702. perhaps they would argue that morality consisted	just of that ability to see a choice	1644.7247511357436
15703. she turned on her side	finding the idea oppressive	262.27671817712906
15704. if adelia had felt about someone as	henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him	2370.763749535215
15705. impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone	167.272460125216
15706. no temptation no virtue	4.434517037214788
15707. a curious	thought to end a curious night	167.89333322753902
15708. the birds were really awake now in a	colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room	touching sill and door table and chair and all of doaty's flowers	in their artificial blossom and leaf	6049.728352710016
15709. before anything else she	would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten	garden	1108.2073630701077
15710. everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty	of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards	1886.0228245406483
15711. she closed her eyes remembering	the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls	788.1290042793913
15712. it had	always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray	1176.4549815216974
15713. after	the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come	she slipped out of bed and went to the open window	2315.1924792642158
15714. the garden below	was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness	1178.4093715321746
15715. leaning	out	she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come	to bloom one just beyond it	2039.252473600359
15716. on a thrusting spray thick with thorns	and dewdrops and swelling pink buds like a summer valentine a bird	balanced and sang nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music	a little engine of song	5665.859907391927
15717. it was so pretty and artless that	she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot	to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never	permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme	d'un certain age	4956.450419600761
15718. feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed	quite soberly and went downstairs	966.295017947291
15719. rosa unbelievably was	not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human	782.421466500471
15720. feeling protective	toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and	milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of	going barefoot	4289.778069407863
15721. outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded	a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and lady's	bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show	rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly	4313.378053717703
15722. the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers	supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws	2134.5157739509823
15723. henrietta held	her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty	782.8703454308671
15724. rummaging in	the dew said rosa coldly	140.1101363655657
15725. go change your shoes before you turn	around	167.72439779428012
15726. she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed	her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay	home	3268.015872126455
15727. folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door	261.50196212310897
15728. to	a blackwell there was only one church	252.03741758528923
15729. the cemetery slumbered just	behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea	1573.7156809916596
15730. for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow	street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying	her with the frankest curiosity	4498.892076151443
15731. she smiled and bowed recalling	the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child	1255.2264430491573
15732. now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested	745.1701074401668
15733. an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and	waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look	as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches	3851.132130132219
15734. on an impulse	she turned back and said good morning	562.9287499201138
15735. he cupped his ear	and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that	he had heard her the first time	2456.4822062468966
15736. he then offered his own estimate	of the weather which was unenthusiastic	956.8935194287166
15737. summer's been slow to	come he said	93.57313999394455
15738. it's my dryin' out time	22.042578409061772
15739. he scowled at her	flowers	14.767645912243335
15740. i'm taking them to the cemetery said henrietta	out of a vague feeling of hospitality	1644.2364710690242
15741. they'll be	takin' me next he said pleasantly but not so soon's they	plan	938.6875683550288
15742. see half of 'em in their graves before i choose my own coffin	1188.3275704951373
15743. it's dryin' myself out that does it	93.01061864699038
15744. he regarded her with	rising hope	65.17540844166503
15745. you'd like to hear how i go about it	262.6499602268073
15746. it's	nice of you henrietta said doubtfully	141.44856172367406
15747. he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and	pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their	old boots	2312.3264086978443
15748. his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became	a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text	3692.2323162706634
15749. every	month f'r three days he said happily i take no water into	my system no water whatsoever	1565.776868133541
15750. henrietta	murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval	of her womanly good sense	2586.438683990433
15751. rests the tissues he said and	pacifies the system	261.44604371744043
15752. my dad did it and he lived to a great age	754.5936525148243
15753. he looked up at her sharply	43.07826019416156
15754. don't remember do you	4.463369159641624
15755. she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father	old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away	2452.5611872642094
15756. next to the blackwells titus had owned the island most and she	and adelia had often stood in front of him silenced by his terrible	years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like	a mariner more aged than possible	6946.571613787635
15757. he had never spoken once to the	awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty	or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea	3248.592720100747
15758. it must be	that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half	his senses	2575.410592344412
15759. she said gently of course i remember you	167.81490163497648
15760. not so well's i remember you he said	251.45762442907477
15761. y're the	young blackwell woman	14.802170076118276
15762. ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded	man	757.6427320393929
15763. i know all about you	15.006442657276404
15764. you do seem to said	henrietta impressed	140.83084608885886
15765. can't blame a man for leavin' his	wife he said quite cheerfully	638.4141758316323
15766. left mine many a time only she	never knew it	561.4014627075628
15767. man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put	in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit	2729.8878926986217
15768. any harm in that	4.3990733225706
15769. probably said henrietta dryly	2.9527342161553007
15770. he gave	a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly	751.8383711775765
15771. you'd be the one	to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none	too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions	were different since all actions had their own laws	4031.9687185517273
15772. only this	old man's connivance was even less to her taste than selma cotter's	open censure	1871.2792740321497
15773. well she had not come back to great island to	be understood praised or condemned	1102.963823083133
15774. she had come to make her peace	with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind	of shadow	3887.091652762197
15775. she started to move away just as a woman came out	of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron	tied over her limp print dress	2988.6843674885276
15776. she smiled vaguely at henrietta and	spoke to the old man	754.8890363637529
15777. you've not had your breakfast yet gran'dad	93.18868763190619
15778. y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast he said	250.74986466408782
15779. milk and sops! he beat the air with his stick and it fell from	his claws and clattered on the stones	2035.1756586237639
15780. he's owly today	his grand-daughter said wearily and bent to pick it up	1173.5777578746884
15781. he's	got this idea about drying out h   it ain't an idea!	if it ain't an idea she said how comes it	you can drink beer but not water	3092.5218396959626
15782. he looked piously to heaven	and said beer don't affect the tissues none and the ingenious	hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave	him his	stint of malevolence	4989.203689365839
15783. come	on do	0.20041515
15784. the children are eating and miss blackwell's on her way	somewheres	749.7994401633259
15785. who ain't	0.20041515
15786. not me	0.30041514999999996
15787. i've got a day's work to do	94.28951752836846
15788. you'll be visiting	miss doaty ma'am	65.41659266653434
15789. henrietta nodded	0.20041515
15790. how much they	knew about her!   the woman	answered the nod with her own	1410.4494100137333
15791. god rest her soul she was a sweet	one	263.4475603019434
15792. come on now	0.30041514999999996
15793. she put a strong hand under the old man's	arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary	tyranny that the young show toward the very old	3248.560797693145
15794. he mumbled at her	but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make	it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by	those who still had their wicked strength	6136.533989441795
15795. there was a gabble	of voices from indoors young hungry sounds like cats after fish and	a burst of swearing from the old man	2483.0753792256764
15796. henrietta looked down at her	bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their	journey's way again leaving the village street and crossing the	first field folly dancing ahead of her	5758.414747722677
15797. at the edge of the	field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like	sheep	1736.3746903189901
15798. they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots	clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and	through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry	5621.139833778956
15799. the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming	as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky	2594.192745662536
15800. she felt mindless	walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near	the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to	doaty	4655.5148462158595
15801. both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered	them but	the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named	dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible	3213.8582188494715
15802. she sat	down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with sea-damp her fingers	tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss	3696.9714944315515
15803. the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished	she had brought her parasol if only to shade doaty's flowers	2320.1532805873603
15804. a small	rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel	in the cemetery	1898.9987885481435
15805. she remembered suddenly a night of savage	moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each	other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in	hand hoping and fearing ghosts	3941.1935221175
15806. the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the	northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still	traces of the mysterious ainu strain	4500.852900021383
15807. the ainus were a primitive	people already living on the island before the principal ancestors	of the japanese came from southern asia	2192.3048467290396
15808. apparently they were of caucasian	blood	64.73088335464627
15809. they had white skins and blue eyes; all their men	were bearded and many of their women were beautiful	1720.24648173363
15810. a pitiful few of	them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing	their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as	the laments of the american indians	5631.258634060345
15811. most of them have been assimilated	but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more	hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly	lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the	tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south	4970.835261735959
15812. tommy	momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions	250.98060178879672
15813. she was taller than	most japanese girls and had the exquisitely willowy form of the	japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall	2476.7915770490827
15814. her nose was higher of	bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn	and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth	that were white and regular and strong	5914.587527927962
15815. her mouth soft and full was	something for any man to dream about	782.4950349019023
15816. she had black eyes long and	intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody	1648.741190803969
15817. she had	been in japan just one week	168.3229438308921
15818. it was an alien land and she hated it	intensely; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests	for duty at san diego bremerton the great lakes pensacola-	any place the navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission	if the request were not granted	7232.65898579707
15819. anywhere would be better than	the land of her ancestors	372.345695209332
15820. there was nothing wrong with her	job	140.44573024130847
15821. tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward	167.4012719316324
15822. there were	no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with	the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor- sometimes the navy	sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage- but mental	health as a rule was very high	6708.439895549421
15823. at present the doctor's main concern	was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted	to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because	the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours	4213.805076735402
15824. tommy	was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding	nurse could do to help the patients	2350.9913670964816
15825. but she suffered in	her	off-duty hours	93.49019209022646
15826. such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop	at the officers' club having coffee and a hamburger to sustain	her until dinnertime	4277.503119044239
15827. she had changed into a cocktail dress and the	whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning	to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck	3449.1748280518077
15828. this was one of the navy's	crossroads- you find them all around the world	1413.0464404263064
15829. ships from	the west coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the seventh	fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleet's principal port for	maintenance upkeep and shore liberty	3111.1849356458856
15830. sooner or later all the gray	navy ships came in here; if tommy sat long enough she would be sure	to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long	beach	5634.502239671861
15831. and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back	there	642.001558722523
15832. she felt rather than saw the approach of the good-looking	young man	967.1424869003853
15833. he came through from the fleet bar which was stag	with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried	1890.3399128273127
15834. when he saw tommy	sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped	566.9094879091521
15835. he was perhaps a trifle	tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently	out of practice; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously	tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as	a lieutenant	4619.9430878030025
15836. probably off one of the carriers- an aviator	250.73999483004278
15837. there	was a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an	even more slender chance that his approach would be different	2312.890708497166
15838. japan	did something to a man- and it wasn't just japan either because	the same thing applied anywhere overseas	2591.74960209634
15839. it was as if foreign duty	implied and excused license; it intimated that the folks at home would	never know about it and therefore why not	2737.449318685368
15840. then the young	man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different	1636.8186589144523
15841. harro girl-san! he said turning on what was meant to be	charm	637.2742246415175
15842. you catchee boy-furiendo	0.30041514999999996
15843. maybe you likee date with me	43.40143495972398
15844. i beg your pardon! tommy said out of her cold	rage	745.2443573612818
15845. i don't believe i know you and i can't understand your	quaint brand of english- it was meant to be english wasn't	it	2317.860231725234
15846. the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels	open-mouthed and blushing	963.2745231140291
15847. at least he had the decency to blush	she thought	374.46154020264754
15848. oh- i'm sorry! you see i thought-	i mean i really had no idea-   oh yes- you had ideas!	tommy interrupted furiously	3285.595320419693
15849. all wrong ones! then she	jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped	into navy slang	2029.1411599292132
15850. take off fly-boy!   uh-	sorry! he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool	1658.3665989151727
15851. the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy	783.9443389640367
15852. she felt like a fool too	65.52867321658073
15853. it hadn't been this way in	college or in nurses' training; it wasn't this way in the hospital	at san diego	2020.6455781908112
15854. everybody had accepted her for what she was- a	very charming girl	963.6444243306435
15855. nobody had addressed her in broken english at any	of those places nobody had suggested that she wasn't american	1713.655642762807
15856. there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with	a moorish hint of the orient in their faces; there are beauties	from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and- back in the	blessed united states- they were regarded simply as pretty women	6912.142319392973
15857. now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not	asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn	2324.199953653442
15858. four little japanese waitresses were murdering	the english language at the counter- yuki kobayashi happened	to be one of them	2805.4693267136236
15859. everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming	when they called bifutek-san! for a steak sandwich or	kohi futotsu! for one cup of coffee	2583.3025921099756
15860. two other japanese girls	were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed	1648.7303563223654
15861. one	was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander; the other	was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children	2028.7480331276606
15862. seeing these did nothing for tommy's mood	140.91831430683968
15863. she told herself	rebelliously and with pride i am an american!   and	so she was and would remain	1576.143714228929
15864. but she was learning that so long as she	was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would	always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english	5479.188338518866
15865. there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had	even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese	2171.7402513397847
15866. tommy wouldn't know; after coming to america her parents had spoken	only english	1189.34070330262
15867. one thing was becoming increasingly sure	43.52915518454017
15868. she had been sent to the wrong place for duty	563.2508085366694
15869. there was more to service	in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward	1259.006015398851
15870. one had	to have friends and a congenial life in after-duty hours h	1190.1630146537009
15871. now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar	379.4151322473448
15872. it was terribly	off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself	that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all	at once she felt lonesome and put-upon	5491.016328226461
15873. she finished her hamburger	and drank her coffee and paid her check; she got out of the coffee	shop before the incident could be repeated	2583.578559235083
15874. eating while angry had given	her a slight indigestion	395.19944015974227
15875. back in her living quarters at the hospital	she took bicarbonate of soda and sulked	1098.2699520418578
15876. then after a while	she went to her mirror	389.8455037802927
15877. she certainly looked	japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men	950.0408755040678
15878. and	still they did not have to be so crude in their approach h	1408.6777229910142
15879. there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its	tone cheerful	1404.1843076395105
15880. she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave	and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima-	which was not very far from yokusuka	5010.135825126432
15881. and tomorrow she would take	time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young	wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown	2982.437820433973
15882. tommy of course	had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin	yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are	better than strangers	4284.006682135997
15883. actually this is only another way	of saying that blood is thicker than water	931.2871813719697
15884. doc doolittle's	scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing	because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young	and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report	5650.655004765709
15885. but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry	was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics	in rabble rousing	2984.0084731456927
15886. just why anybody should wish to start a riot the	executive officer didn't know	1424.299328250253
15887. in his opinion doc had not grown	up	167.26861312874033
15888. the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief	391.6098874595865
15889. there	had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up	788.5087440061698
15890. he had	come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving guns	appleby before him	2371.009808634748
15891. the war found him much too early and its perils-	and especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in horseplay	and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found	any stabilizing sobering influence	3762.5817207732134
15892. he remained young at heart with	an overdeveloped sense of humor	752.4993442998514

15898. doc had been under restriction to the	ship since the bustard left subic	1180.2481550714824

15900. at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of	the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might	have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply	base	5341.238496697567
15901. this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and	suited him quite well	1096.6229861445138
15902. there were two things he wanted to do: inspect	one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval	base and visit an old shipmate	4869.619231792698
15903. a telephone line had been	hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange	1098.5230882935198

15913. he considered	some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from	dawn to dusk	1430.0885723397437
15914. then there was exercise boating and hiking which was	not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought	of strenuous activity left him exhausted	4481.109650347342
15915. perhaps golf with a fashionable	companion- but he'd lost his clubs hadn't played in years	1096.5811189764072
15916. there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was	so white he looked like the bottom of a frog	3288.513341953042

15925. owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next	to his but he hadn't come to reno for stag dinners	2174.76655637559
15926. thanks	owen said but friday is a long way off and anything can happen	1417.0753004442959
15927. buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims	rest	501.61832705302305

15937. our	church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska	789.9503068539781
15938. we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends	and bringing the light	1905.8914056485082
15939. they're up there in that freezing climate	and all of us have to try and help them	1408.2345875927929
15940. oh	0.30041514999999996
15941. you see she said looking past him into the room where	the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i	can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo	3481.6700970620454
15942. why is that	0.30041514999999996
15943. she apparently wasn't satisfied with	his reaction	94.3474574931122
15944. smug owen thought smug and sappy	65.55394595836087
15945. there was a slight	nervous twitch in the region of her left eye	787.2583890350681
15946. it gave her a lewd winking	effect	141.17396592411248
15947. have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo	260.92022917781054
15948. she asked winking wildly	4.459879968436347
15949. they are a very difficult group	of people	166.49441933540612
15950. i don't know much about them owen admitted	but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably	resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not	to do	5479.018143140823
15951. she smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion	43.55181316816069
15952. you know	that's very interesting	22.452371820680014
15953. people don't know how much they give	away about themselves by remarks like that	939.130094406396
15954. the more canvassing i do	the more i note how far most people are from their personal god	2369.622935813599

15957. that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the	pitch	1410.619276332031
15958. several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly	retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward	him and raised her voice	4676.743117521106
15959. how did you get by the desk	93.27400084994261
15960. he asked curiously	0.30041514999999996
15961. i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're	wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers' doors and	talking down eskimos	1734.12447233568
15962. oh i just come once a week	141.63066876484092

15969. i have the whole pacific	northwest	43.65451240468967
15970. owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he	couldn't help himself	954.3304183321859
15971. mrs gertrude parker drew back	14.90779782752848
15972. that's hardly a christian approach she remonstrated	141.15585200246477
15973. you're	in the secular world	14.877786036154708
15974. i didn't say it was christian	64.80724235657506
15975. i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen	261.4104536202823
15976. not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books	make a lot of money for publishing houses but they don't get top	personnel	3894.1570148981127
15977. our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics	168.04130797803919
15978. god i take it plays no part in this she said waspishly	958.41311102041
15979. god doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics he said	heatedly before he caught himself	940.1296826823193
15980. it sounded silly; why go on	65.48808541879484
15981. more people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible	conversation	1096.0484041166696
15982. and whiskey she said smiling and	blinking at the highball glasses	755.081581064117
15983. don't forget whiskey; it's	such a big seller	167.78806010618882
15984. you know he said getting a grip	on himself i think you're going to have to excuse me	2336.242568857051
15985. i can imagine she said	14.803741737111531
15986. probably	down at the bar	22.379110828262895
15987. but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters	375.88352411848075

15991. i	have no card she said bitterly	93.51958329940922
15992. you haven't been listening	to what i've been telling you	566.8354923306467
15993. i only hope my talking to you has	helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual bucking-up	1583.2880275539733
15994. she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole	human race	1195.0767144135693
15995. she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down	the hall; he heard her knocking on another door	1565.148213597394
15996. it took him	about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry	1644.3415809794265
15997. he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for	breakfast	788.7676591465183
15998. on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail	956.8803682963456
15999. there	was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins	on new lines they always issued	1573.2754328310975
16000. his lawyer had sent him a statement	on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector	of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last	year's exemptions	5496.273771602308
16001. he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but	afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced	1725.4727193823442
16002. he looked off to the crest of the sierras still white-topped; the	glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle	3033.245763478498
16003. he felt suddenly	elated adventurous	14.917474505647723
16004. with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot	752.9174327348629
16005. although it was only three o'clock he stopped in	at the golden calf	790.4249816384225
16006. the tables were all spinning the dice rattling	the bar crowded	757.3999273392199
16007. just to test himself he played roulette for quarters	on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he	had won surprisingly twenty dollars	2744.1484319567226
16008. the way was opening up; when	the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its	whirling around in his stomach	2823.3916556927716
16009. the golden calf was dimly lit	with shaded neon	260.48255262725877
16010. there were more women than men in the place but	he couldn't find a flowerpot	1649.9923541251283
16011. they all had the hard look of gamblers	who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly	caring what showed up	2176.9573822239227
16012. the mural around the wall depicted early settlers	in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers	2594.090690431588
16013. the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from	the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were	stern but hopeful	2865.3337387766355
16014. all of course except the donner party who were	bent on starving to death	1396.8066734537265
16015. i wonder if they did eat each	other at the end owen mused	783.2624788212512
16016. he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered	blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes	1870.8790112753882
16017. she	sighed a dirty word and left	93.85405882222001
16018. owen was surprised to see mrs gertrude	parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged	by the entrance	2589.1727259361146
16019. she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim	as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the	lay-sisters depending on her support	2983.891218114824
16020. a dried-up cowboy sat down	next to him in the blonde's place	960.1842026456318
16021. he was a little more authentic	than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables	1100.766993903721
16022. what you	need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen	play	1419.9239857308708
16023. you can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen	93.90859151199962
16024. what are you playing	4.424913316391172
16025. owen asked	0.20041515
16026. i'm	just logging the cowboy explained	65.25056232604238
16027. i keep all these plays in this	little black book and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find	out what numbers are repeating	2458.9774652671617
16028. but roulette's not my game	22.160067273464396
16029. i'm	always	trying to find a breaking table in blackjack	373.19652045834823
16030. incidentally i'm	pretty famous in these parts: i'm called the wrangler	749.2578272034732
16031. don't you have to spend any time on your	ranch	372.04526101793056
16032. well of course i do	22.384163062773787
16033. i'm with the	bar-h	pushing a horse called sparky	261.0544282917782
16034. he's my own horse and what	i collect from him i use on blackjack	1414.1906573267229
16035. this sparky can rack and single-foot	and he's the fastest thing in washoe county	945.8095968964672
16036. i figure if	i can get any kind of publicity campaign going i'll land him on	tv- you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero	4459.087933111176
16037. i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky	643.952368720148
16038. he's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully	141.69976577437293
16039. five came	up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to	play a loss of ten dollars	1878.30699571064
16040. this proved conclusively that the wrangler	was a jinx so he walked on down to hurrays an even more glorified	gambling den than the golden calf	4121.710682749215
16041. when he looked in the back	mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards	789.5817897791553
16042. his adventurous	spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays	featured as an added attraction	2138.3534692231156
16043. he ogled a long redhead with green	eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her	1872.6257791180656
16044. he had no	great	prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run	1417.375846224016
16045. there was no cash around; everyone was flipping silver dollars	370.67405462910904
16046. the	management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave	the customers chips or checks or premium points	2855.708570591036
16047. he read a special	announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three	am starring adele brenner and fourteen glamorous	schoolgirls	2179.6726416737115
16048. he wondered if he might bag a tourist but	they looked frightened of him	1413.124308603798
16049. he passed two brides both wearing orchids	and they made him feel a little sad	1106.1480868221074
16050. owen found buzz watching	chuck-a-luck	22.18051379139624
16051. buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some	sun-tan oil and dark glasses	1108.0755922735732
16052. he was shorter and fatter than owen	who felt good standing next to him	1398.7638384733987
16053. we're all going over to lake	tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva buzz explained still	instigating	1414.9957412777876
16054. we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees	we can beat the wheel	1880.7912294377875
16055. he started out as a stickman then became a pit	boss until the club found him crossroading	1425.3635803567934
16056. he was knocking down checks	at faro	140.97509632296396
16057. i'm allergic to tahoe owen explained	43.445972838535475
16058. well okay buzz	said	4.41411768167019
16059. we'll see you around later	14.793980847076668
16060. owen went over to	the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldn't pyramid with	any consecutive success	2816.2743954118205
16061. how's your luck honey	2.9585127426619158
16062. a	short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him	563.1205086136576
16063. she looked	well-fed and prosperous but he didn't get the impression he was being	propositioned the way he'd been hoping	1882.5130068692292
16064. i haven't	had any luck since i was a baby	559.0081275071777
16065. stake me she said	and let me at those dice	373.4229074875265

16067. we'll	get it in a hurry and get it out	372.68618542583556
16068. let's have a drink	and discuss a merger	253.719499291871
16069. if you go broke she said smiling	up at him i'll leave you	784.9285120960444
16070. sounds like real	love owen said	65.44141864967978
16071. it sort of brings a lump to my throat	262.3886235509363
16072. my name's gisele the blonde said after she ordered a	scotch	756.8003834430012
16073. my mother wanted to call me sylphide	but it sounded too affected	636.3309178577975
16074. is there any word you would like	to offer in your own defense	1192.7027626172867
16075. spencer shook his head	2.9697231753747992
16076. alexander said answer me properly spencer	64.69598978096998
16077. spencer	was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing	i want to say captain	1565.1277537654728
16078. naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor	564.5388095743671
16079. philip spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain	yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address	2451.2215672462107
16080. during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of	spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers	3465.5543335697075
16081. those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal	aft under pretence of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching	an opportunity to communicate with him	3430.561812818217
16082. hostile glances were	flashed at both alexander and gansevoort	395.2676387856566
16083. the two met in the captain's	cabin	94.17052391829925
16084. what is the next step captain	65.62954736883799
16085. more arrests i fear	2.9706163987773606
16086. in your opinion who is this e	andrews on the 'certain' list	964.9073956816949
16087. cromwell of course	0.20041515
16088. he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot	560.2374836148527
16089. he saw the dangers	not the glories of being identified as a mutineer	795.9422960841591
16090. somehow he	talked spencer into letting him use another name	560.0729676531533
16091. there was	a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished	to see the captain	1888.9782179827332
16092. heiser	breathless and wild-eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes	heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their	customary places	3297.0514146088744
16093. and also sir two articles which were considered	souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely	1400.9822388345192
16094. an	african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley	and green	1650.359193585417
16095. mckinley was overheard to say that he would like	to get the knife into spencer's possession and that-	where did you gather all this information heiser	2731.96205080816
16096. who reported	to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who-	he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the	ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him	5206.23204081809
16097. a glance revealed	that the main topgallant mast had been carried away	640.0793876387377
16098. the aimless milling	about of what had been a well-trained well-organized crew struck	alexander with horror	1892.8703992160724
16099. he bellowed orders and watched the alert response	of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned	their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for	further instruction	3791.078918805022
16100. adrien deslonde hastened to alexander's	side	64.86824633906114
16101. small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full	intention to carry away the mast	940.7379006876305
16102. i saw him myself and it was done after	consultation with cromwell	967.5102050728286
16103. and it was	clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell	took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast	till philip spencer had given the signal to obey	3954.3611754134063
16104. then with disappointment	evident upon their faces they moved to the work	959.7285020180095
16105. alexander	guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the	ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed	2040.4806058560475
16106. their strategy	was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip	spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated	3710.1292053394877
16107. when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small	and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons	sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers	3648.4801312254667
16108. spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing	muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure	at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three	by glance and signal	5306.205728875446
16109. one of the missing handspikes came out of its	hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed	by seaman wilson	2030.4458772772546
16110. tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort	and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing	the weapon	3274.8199388407897
16111. wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the	other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley	1725.551598339082
16112. not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by	the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny	3700.9570486163166
16113. in the	tiny cabin alexander met with gansevoort heiser and wales to	speak and to listen	1261.844892751508
16114. three days had passed since spencer's arrest	and each day had brought new dangers new fears	1890.58703816768
16115. gansevoort said	it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we	can now rely	1576.832022690035
16116. to have the greek paper is not the great help that at	first flush it seemed	1876.1393059656398
16117. from actions aboard it is easy to guess that	spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate	1723.9557006803905
16118. well heiser ventured why don't we hold an investigation	with questioning and-   that would be worse	than useless alexander broke in	3047.1200788674323
16119. there is not space to hold	or force to guard any increased number of prisoners	1097.6150214225877
16120. besides suppose	we hold a court of inquiry then what	561.1877347846408
16121. then we have informed a large	number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will	be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are	expected to perform their jobs in good order	4183.331361442081
16122. mr heiser does this	sound like a truly workable plan to you	972.4945319722923
16123. do you not think these men	might choose the black flag here and now	951.0222739997814
16124. wales said	of	course they would	65.36407011468685
16125. they are about to do so at any moment as it	is	639.7516775908996
16126. all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to	take the lead	1882.5003757872557
16127. as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the	others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed	2601.018018431916
16128. we	are going to be rushed and murdered	250.74950324865404
16129. that is extravagant	language mr wales	43.352728490133174
16130. we are not going to be rushed and murdered	alexander said	751.973208428313
16131. we are going to bring the somers into new	york harbor safe and sound	944.8634140521796
16132. of course i agree with	the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy	is ferocious and desperate	2143.7295661072635
16133. the instinct of discipline has been lost	93.67063004899701
16134. anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand	391.5814553820075
16135. he paused	then added everything on a ship is a weapon	505.1954160559406
16136. implements of wood	and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where	a man stands	2360.355701268049
16137. and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many	639.880054461182
16138. we ourselves must stand sentinel	22.037766723938248
16139. under arms day and night watch and watch about	263.61657991144796
16140. those of us present	the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have	the responsibility of the somers	2593.6719558990762
16141. a great deal of labor we have	as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed	1872.750302941793
16142. and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his	head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done	what in the end would be done	5478.078110006214
16143. with all his heart he had loved the navy	and now he must act in accordance with the navy's implacable laws	2040.9361627011228
16144. and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary	to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to	which he had dedicated his soul	5145.414279961043
16145. where had he failed	2.943322030719629
16146. how	had he failed	4.411934573593573
16147. he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately	to be a great officer	1256.6257909927604
16148. it came to him as he wept there aboard the	somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek	to storm the gates of heaven	4639.525091645983
16149. it was given or it was not given	166.8826191011826
16150. one	did one's best and if fortune smiled there was a reward	966.2551085415386
16151. one did	one's best and if fortune frowned an eighteen-year-old boy with murder	in his heart sailed aboard one's ship	1886.5150254136756
16152. and alexander sobbed	like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame	2139.3476304842525
16153. god knew	his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with	an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career	3330.782768959184
16154. another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist	751.1043356246583
16155. it	was for love that he had served the navy	379.1063443973736
16156. to have someday that love	returned was what he had lived for	956.902546255832
16157. now the hope was gone	14.68338026951857
16158. yes he	would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price	1647.419749030038
16159. dear god at what a price	43.46847354685895
16160. and after a while he dried	his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and	dignity	2845.663050114301
16161. stern-faced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself	that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason	1406.6941797774493
16162. the prisoners	averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger	1421.734135093951
16163. only cromwell the giant boatswain was mild-mannered and respectful	260.3736858720332
16164. he said captain may i speak please	139.8088143401245
16165. captain	i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship	641.2311611557997
16166. are	you cromwell	0.30041514999999996
16167. yes sir	0.20041515
16168. before god i swear i am	innocent	140.2257787333297
16169. i know nothing of any plot if there is such a thing	640.7712885205093
16170. you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt	745.7472930422215
16171. i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent	372.85243595943814
16172. he leaned	closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck	965.7346403729068
16173. surely captain	you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything	939.2988416128921
16174. no cromwell i did not find your name	248.742131585687
16175. you were careful	about that	14.82657267602263
16176. now spencer seeming with effort to shake	himself from lethargy spoke	752.9023362536475
16177. he said cromwell is telling you the	truth	169.77693140403812
16178. alexander shifted his gaze to spencer	64.62339851518001
16179. the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness	of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend	cromwell	2601.5861092039063
16180. alexander knew spencer too well to think him nai^ve or	thick-skulled	753.4823826743822
16181. and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized	a kinship with spencer	931.9787199437939
16182. here was another human who understood	the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable	1181.2961892535473
16183. there was good fortune	and there was bad and philip spencer in handcuffs and ankle irons	knew it to be a truth	2164.279277908358
16184. he expected nothing for himself but that	which naturally follows those marked for misfortune	1408.628460888471
16185. the red-haired	captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority	was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer	2590.043166621737
16186. this tragic lad had forged his own shackles	253.4063613919965
16187. but he could not	have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him	1419.6260526673682
16188. and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired	captain they would be each other's undoing	2367.7275610013617
16189. spencer	if there is guilt if you do not deny your own how is it possible for	cromwell to be innocent	2035.462652123356
16190. he was your constant companion	22.1472829153648
16191. the hazel eyes met alexander's	14.832179161473642
16192. i tell you he is innocent	65.32212285414462
16193. and do you think there is a reason why i should accept	your word	945.6960972669683
16194. yes	0.30041514999999996
16195. i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell	166.03306316576885
16196. nothing to lose either spencer	22.111610879963113
16197. that's	true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation	378.08970496208997
16198. his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea	391.6666472605954
16199. i	am innocent captain cromwell said again	93.97893402362931
16200. before god captain	i am innocent	64.76689482851988
16201. and though it was logical that a man	who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still	it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell	3427.875859995318
16202. the boatswain was as guilty as any	140.94796703579695
16203. no action of his could be interpreted	in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the	significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwell's hands	while spencer whispered explanations	3539.2604794772014
16204. i thought midshipman	rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him	geometry	1177.0259519447884
16205. it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles	to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him	2038.1767306502684
16206. this	was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an	element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized	3258.7296769157974
16207. some	of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless	a percentage of them were spencer's followers	1720.043545561383
16208. rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to	study the torah	1661.1817222734069
16209. bits of trash lay in the roadway	93.75879150687918
16210. the air smelled	warmish and foul	64.68971209760228
16211. a young man appeared out of a side alley and	walked toward us with quick strides	1260.1269400995945
16212. he wore a long double-breasted	coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles	2127.6838572748343
16213. his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high	944.2615358402987
16214. with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed	by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead	3273.310642483066
16215. he had a pinkish-white	complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and	tightly curled paot	1423.2835157027293
16216. i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms	249.27239827732328
16217. the	girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their	legs with cloth stockings	1262.5565844372127
16218. i turned and watched him stride down the	center of the road	968.9289130514398
16219. his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed	through the dingy market place with his back straight and pivoting	on his heel he entered an old stone building	3211.8688808798834
16220. rachel had seen	me watching the young man	249.96891904050102
16221. when your mother was here	he must have been a young boy	642.1465372362146
16222. like the ones you will see now	142.16527269594565
16223. i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside	rachel	793.1352180325687
16224. she led me into a twisting side alley	253.0832756961409
16225. the dirty discolored	buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above	our heads	1257.4317082987516
16226. rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most	of the buildings	754.862085344012
16227. we entered one where the front door stood ajar and	climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor	1892.9518814768428
16228. an old man with a	white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a	black skullcap greeted us	3268.2163854079727
16229. he nodded clasping	and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me	1101.561737162013
16230. i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed	but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor	4288.483289526675
16231. his toes pointed out toward the walls	93.58527468907138
16232. he stopped in front of a	door placed a finger on his lips and still peering down into his beard	pushed open the door to a classroom	4284.738358470897
16233. he left	us	0.20041515
16234. little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and	in the center of the room sat the teacher	2362.7036555445334
16235. his black beard dripped down	over the front of his coat	503.96922345411974
16236. one white hand poised a stick above his	desk	391.1783864971819
16237. he turned his surly half-closed eyes toward us stared for	a second then shouted in yiddish one two three! rapping	the stick against the desk	2593.3823073436884
16238. the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation	or interpretation of the five books of moses which they	had previously chanted in hebrew	3480.1436981326674
16239. they chanted a fixed tune in time	to the report of the stick	787.3440374894292
16240. each boy opened his small mouth wide and	rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and	great-grandfather	had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe	5017.80652962225
16241. they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses	of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets	of paot framing their little white faces	3110.35195577056
16242. they bent over	yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher	1190.0989872993127
16243. since they	did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty	for distraction	1561.2291988053448
16244. the guttural language from the ghetto stopped	141.4943773198398
16245. the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew	rapping the stick incessantly	1419.309155612807
16246. one boy who rocked back	and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles	2147.353267306789
16247. his tightly	curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders	373.0216220042204
16248. in the center	of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap	959.8663410326574
16249. his head barely	rose above the table	93.26865050495587
16250. i stared at him for a long time	250.27612838697627
16251. he did not return	my interest	43.40368228079243
16252. my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the	one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the	boys	3916.30872427206
16253. some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the	words long ago	952.2043318862367
16254. they singsonged the portion at the teacher who accompanied	them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick	3049.2642265487943
16255. the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake	378.5385468263216
16256. i could	not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair	1423.4016985541252
16257. his body pitched	back and forth on the bench	262.7176561178684
16258. his front teeth were missing	22.153491676997795
16259. i	shuddered and backed out of the room	166.37850105826766
16260. rachel followed looked at me	and clucked with her tongue	555.548521299216
16261. we walked down the cool hall silently	94.46229114745793
16262. from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices	of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and	prayer	4494.006268836312
16263. i said how long do they keep that up	259.97896380531694
16264. all day she said	4.41411768167019
16265. except for shabbat when they are praying	all day	260.9236320868157
16266. i rubbed my hands together	22.055396147691315
16267. they had turned	numb and prickly in the classroom	262.96517842517767
16268. the old man in the baggy clothes	waited at the foot of the steps	1416.9074800883348
16269. he glanced down into his beard and	muttered something in yiddish	503.50272226067045
16270. rachel said he asks for money	65.47733827667837
16271. i reached into the pocket of my skirt	fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin	1100.238649019383
16272. then i picked it up	again and handed it to the old man	1180.0726214716974
16273. i didn't look at	him	14.847943388935676
16274. does this bother you	4.463369159641624
16275. i	said	0.20041515
16276. most of our sabras think it's	horrible	140.41713136967496
16277. when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were	lying down in the roads so we could not pass	2028.059029262644
16278. they said that we must	not fight but wait for the messiah	953.9235978669788
16279. you	had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and	appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home	3219.1900814407295
16280. you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal	394.2967869205125
16281. i was	american	0.20041515
16282. you had to know also that you were going to fail	749.442722450523
16283. all	of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place	1255.659414302806
16284. rachel faced me	0.30041514999999996
16285. her bright eyes were twinkling	14.798795610189192
16286. she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for	us while we play around	1634.4716877623798
16287. your mother hated this way of life	93.1230708623244
16288. she	wished to change much for the children here	391.4290073362298
16289. i said quietly	respectfully what did she do here	262.16215774775935
16290. in this section	0.30041514999999996
16291. rachel	clicked her tongue behind her teeth	93.74296422932375
16292. but when	she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away	and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim	4095.230353207034
16293. she was a strange woman your mother	93.52838289026178
16294. when she loved it was	with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those	things she loved	3039.7666063974234
16295. nothing was too impossible for her to do when she	wanted	501.12044635126705
16296. she stayed here to work for aliah	140.24576368601873
16297. for many immigrants for	many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your	mother	1567.129362951409
16298. sometimes it was dangerous for her	64.74355920252036
16299. but she loved danger	2.975300549264201
16300. she took it with her wherever she went;	she chose it	749.6273183058729
16301. and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought	out helping other people	1257.4906582763706
16302. she was most strange woman	22.17748466664988
16303. ready to	follow her impulse	14.772592030559622
16304. it was an impulse when she was here in me'a she'arim-	i was with her- that led her to stay in israel	3233.2628408887317
16305. your	mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave	their ghettos	1093.6408187702614
16306. here they did not need to be in ghettos	389.64736172685946
16307. if she could	not take the children out of this section at least she could take other	children out of their countries and put them on the farms	2972.7190507438518
16308. she set	out to make sure that no jewish child anyplace in the world had to	live in a place such as this	3471.502783603074
16309. i said quietly gaining nerve	ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to	be rebuffed then why did she leave israel	2701.5527065791475
16310. i'd like to know	that very much	140.34702061148124
16311. rachel clasped her hands together and slowed	her pace	259.10851931584193
16312. the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones	561.8488799339389
16313. she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that	i thought she was angry with me	1553.7024596152837
16314. but she sighed and her face relaxed	140.7103969950887
16315. trouble came into her life	14.78394811806738
16316. she had good friends here people	who liked her	391.6417036963286
16317. but she had to go out and hurt herself	261.36797303801393
16318. there was a man here in town	139.69017955303104
16319. he helped her meet people so she could	go out and do the work she wanted	1270.8953975437382
16320. there was	a refugee who was able to come here because of her	1170.5519186432296
16321. he came with his	son	14.772152806208965
16322. at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it	was not so	1623.4010691388362
16323. this refugee was a middle-aged man a big handsome man	with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen	2183.212356203644
16324. he had the black	numerals on his arm so he had been branded in a concentration camp	2126.5410801682915
16325. yet he walked like a young man	94.64540246663361
16326. often he was terribly despondent	and talked to no one	561.1569162362978
16327. then he would walk off for a few days alone in	the direction of europe	1095.5347163461724
16328. all his family was dead except for his son	390.81298345339377
16329. your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she	would send him home to his son	1735.693393641543
16330. he loved the son and was always glad	to be sent back to him	1407.9553321696571
16331. then his son did something- rachel threw	up her hands- i don't know what but something to an official	here- it was during the mandate- and the son was imprisoned	3208.3281633199786
16332. a	few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed	960.5738392955385
16333. she	ran from a little group of us	166.52649714501203
16334. we were sitting together talking	22.15767342005802
16335. she	went to the father and found he had hanged himself	504.01959793766235
16336. it was silent in the stone alley	140.342016678912
16337. then she continued with energy	i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find	the father	2326.7273763020853
16338. no one saw her except the man reuveni	249.5157496243478
16339. i know him	0.20041515
16340. rachel gave me a direct bright-eyed	look	142.23009117462715
16341. she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep	interest in this refugee	1093.4769741426576
16342. he said she would only hurt herself	141.72477792067866
16343. he complained	to me once that i must talk to her	496.9571066806411
16344. when i did she shrugged	her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him	1873.5881553999147
16345. i asked	her if she would and she said she would not	645.4141778655619
16346. he had known when	he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she	did not intend to marry him	3881.9584588671664
16347. anyway i did not see her until two	weeks after the refugee hanged himself	938.902069915551
16348. she came to me one day	65.41553646053237
16349. she	was pale and skinny; she was terribly alone	262.05078321326175
16350. and she said that after	this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted	his proposal	3269.271162851836
16351. he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't	understand why she had upset herself	1568.7056418820675
16352. but now he was happy she	would let him straighten out her life and take care of her	2349.237480623672
16353. he would	never let her harm herself again	165.44489283027283
16354. for one whole week he never let her	stay alone	562.0110087770133
16355. she let him lead her around	43.44561352592124
16356. he took her to a doctor	for she was run down nervous did not care where she was	2352.007454018483
16357. reuveni took	her with him wherever he went	166.98164051019913
16358. he did not let her talk to people;	he did not let her choose her own food	2108.053963536863
16359. she was limp and beaten from	her loss; she did not care	641.8431900250631
16360. and i'll take you with me	65.1747443925289
16361. the two of them against the world	94.14526689085551
16362. that had been how she imagined it	139.9909878585409
16363. for when he began to talk and	dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun	dreaming too	2469.2523723642257
16364. but now the dream was over	65.29321124489678
16365. the big waking up had happened	43.57809519899066
16366. what did i imagine	4.447067945102941
16367. she thought	0.20041515
16368. did i see	him about to swing low in a chariot	752.5859384158642
16369. or maybe poling up the south	fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it	1570.7837563798014
16370. maybe	i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it	1410.6800900180058
16371. and i'll take you with me	43.479851710675504
16372. he had taken her all right	64.82253931420873
16373. wednesday nights after youth fellowship	14.72517602807252
16374. out of the church and into	his big car it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights	sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college his expansiveness	the quaint little pine board tourist courts cabins really with a	cute naked light bulb in the ceiling	like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were	a kid where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs watching	a room complete with moths pinging	the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls an insect	highway patrol with feelers waving	0.30166232349522504
16375. and the bed that sagged in	a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before	and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when	gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something	on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you	when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had	heard you listened	0.20124717349522497
16376. and gratt shafer would be in memphis today	for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like	everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along	4853.883599176177
16377. like	mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette	back in his office yanking out teeth like they all knew he would	2721.5605634646518
16378. just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and	wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like	that would happen	5373.344417128916
16379. or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open	just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any	harm to starkey	poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because	you were tired of being an old maid- a thing which cannot admit when	it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all	alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to	say to somebody in a normal voice: i think i'm pregnant	0.20124717349522497
16380. or you could wish your daddy would really do it-	kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time all along	could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured	tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night	7735.348016244502
16381. so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to	the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights waiting for you	for your new spectator pumps waiting for you to squat by yourself out	there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned	son-of-a-bitch tire off because that is being an old maid too	if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the	night and in the mud and the rain hating to get out in it but afraid	to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help	0.20124717349522497
16382. and every sound that	might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped	you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell	a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that	is being an old maid too	7798.179482962902
16383. it is not having his baby nestled warm	and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really	gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull	3222.4193762575246
16384. and most of all it	is not having the only man you could love whether he drives a bread	truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds	or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines for if you are	anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the	one	8348.21295543278
16385. he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town	ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldn't figure	out how it is unlocked	2855.7442939824555
16386. and he can be on the way to memphis your	gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and	love him and want him even if it means you want him- really want	him- dead	6357.593046622492
16387. because if you can't then nobody else can either	nobody else can have him	946.3138226825001
16388. for you don't share him not even with god	393.67210406901677
16389. if it is love you don't	43.94396758714258
16390. and i'll take you with me	65.1747443925289
16391. even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give	the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will	always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world	you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one	was a lie	5489.0880674036625
16392. even when he is on the way to memphis you will still	have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside	of you	4487.718363572803
16393. and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants	you or not you go with him in your heart	2325.1009581799094
16394. you feel him every mile	further away	141.74185012307026
16395. you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you	feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could	love him the way you do the one who got him because she didn't	particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't	5134.17520325708
16396. and you know	you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted	him so bad that you didn't get him and you can feel nearly sorry	enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who begged	you to marry him the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't	afford and the too-shiny shoes	8669.786704344426
16397. you think: did he feel	that way about me	260.3411784631138
16398. it comes to you that probably he did feel that	way	to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have gratt shafer;	that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to	turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy	7699.09927002245
16399. it dawns	on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table	from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making	you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafer's	substitute that other guy	4664.663584460979
16400. and you wonder if that is why the little	man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he	straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big	unhappy success	6337.087242309622
16401. you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of	you	791.0550827031432
16402. you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it	comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody	else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself to give somebody else	the one they wanted- to give them you	7153.441875909901
16403. damn the world	she thought	14.786069509268287
16404. she looked out at the corn field the great green deep	acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed	fence bordering the grounds	4671.74183568259
16405. the mayor envisioned factories there	14.755146949303892
16406. homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead	of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your	heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand	and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments	7259.616433614979
16407. the bands were impatient	but they were the only ones	374.84972136078613
16408. the others the ones in the stands	were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening	to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city	4631.740900834528
16409. it was	like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano	virtuoso rehearsing	1425.8097518763868
16410. he was good and they knew that what he was doing	for them he would do all over the united states some day	3481.579378074297
16411. so they	stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not	listening exactly but rather feeling	2303.3587420474855
16412. if a man was good if he	was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever	3480.6378734815
16413. you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up	there you were someone else and the world was something else too	2459.7388196689426
16414. it	was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it	1640.8570975481375
16415. you	laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little	bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and	the goose bumps rippled along your arm	3970.9474690264424
16416. he hit the theme about dying	to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without	a second thought	3478.0220262021853
16417. while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west	tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world	no matter if it hadn't in six weeks rained enough to wet a rat's	ass	3771.851387324078
16418. she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with	weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting	all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought	which must follow now in august- yes with eyes predicting the	drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts	of gratt shafer would not leave her	8712.407411407115
16419. i should have stayed at	the store she thought	260.7278034055515
16420. back at the factory-to-you with	the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was	thirty-four which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working	conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had	to hold shut while you sat down	7235.944903313304
16421. there was no lock because herman didn't	allow a lock	376.07882803072846
16422. a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering	and primping	565.7466983772463
16423. the toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and	there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place	because you couldn't keep the public out- entirely	3228.2335272847004
16424. she could not	count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs	that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the	pipe connections from the wall	5508.95258569185
16425. the two little bangs meant that he	was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that	if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite	door handle which she would be clutching whichever-the-hell clerk it	was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot	5452.332104465723
16426. and the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night	on saturdays and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldn't	smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter	or janitor	6195.4169656117665
16427. among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from	spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick	lettering jobs	2470.5593505472725
16428. each of us had his own specialty besides	252.68783665913574
16429. george	did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a	medieval	miniature: hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten	sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's	glass	3667.5478664426673
16430. he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary	and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or	esquire	3271.1231336027117
16431. i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints:	naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the	doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching	a revolver	3949.7463509371228
16432. the book could be the brothers karamazov but	it would still have the same jacket illustration	1874.4549883120908
16433. i remember once i	did a jacket for magpie press; the book was a fine historical novel	about edward 3 and i did a week of research to get the details	just right: the fifteenth-century armor furnishings clothes	4058.8476921354986
16434. i	even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made- linden	wood covered with leather- so i'd get the light reflections accurate	3481.7055299217886
16435. mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch	and said nothing doing rufus	1260.5745393762325
16436. in the first place it's static;	in the second place it doesn't look authentic; and in the third	place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place-	you've got six colors there including gold	5935.486145052375
16437. i said mr mckenzie	it is as authentic as careful research can make it	949.2879875678306
16438. he	said that may be but it isn't authentic the way readers think	1180.0581333101734
16439. they know from their researches into television and the movies that	knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little	lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards	3239.5721703694417
16440. and girls couldn't	have dressed like that- it isn't transparent enough	748.1437431075941
16441. in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in	the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a	sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of	a costume movie	4792.266421256306
16442. mckenzie was as happy as a clam	142.31231177484028
16443. as for donald he actually sold paintings	93.86167661118864
16444. we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as	easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made	any regular money at it	5146.230219359826
16445. not much; he sold perhaps three or four	a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends	1724.8397616530115
16446. he had style	a real inner vision of his very own	758.6034786749266
16447. it was strange stuff- it	reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played	with other kids and has lived all its life with adults	3320.536416212948
16448. there was	the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of	self-consciousness	but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and	smack you in the eye	5167.533297251867
16449. we used to kid him by saying he only painted	that way because he was so nearsighted	1415.5895518958498
16450. it may have been true for all	i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles	but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting	4461.960260259622
16451. he also had	at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker; he would	look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said	for christ's sake donald you've got prussian blue all	over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint	would be all over his pants as well	5487.646466504487
16452. mrs monmouth thought of	him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a	painting	2585.249135993643
16453. it was all gravy and donald didn't need much to live on;	none of us did	1242.5182351366097
16454. we shared the expenses of the studio and we all	lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or	another	3680.5969472659576
16455. attending the life class was my idea- or rather askington's	idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldn't	have gone if i hadn't talked them into it	3321.9533364894437
16456. i wanted to paint again	22.144472641431747
16457. i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year	374.4567052101693
16458. it wasn't	just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used	even to myself	2364.406850754779
16459. it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of	the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting	2310.6895324275147
16460. i kept saying	if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real	money get to be well known as an illustrator- like peter askington	for instance- then i could take some time off and paint	6204.077724292079
16461. askington was a kind of goal i set myself; i had admired him	long before i talked to him	1729.849613725744
16462. it looked to me as though he had everything	an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession	a large and steady income	4102.801789573034
16463. the night we first met at one of mrs	monmouth's giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket	with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt; instead of a necktie	he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set	a lump of pale pure jade	5102.241879755339
16464. this set his tone: richness of texture	and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and	decorations would have paid the brush-off's rent for a year	4841.884540559054
16465. he was	fifteen years older than i- forty-four- but full of spring and	sparkle	940.5177863076685
16466. he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man and	his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger	3506.0538073244024
16467. he was one	of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america; you saw one	of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national	magazines every month	3350.722359564352
16468. life had included him in its modern american	artists series and had photographed him at his studio in	the east sixties; the corner of it you could see in the photograph	looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty	of spain	7035.748449237099
16469. i had a long talk with him	93.86504525791938
16470. we went into mrs	monmouth's library which had low bookshelves all along the walls	and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet	long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like	an inscription from a martian tomb	6704.613273138026
16471. the fireplace had tiles made	for mrs monmouth by picasso himself	502.77774571869776
16472. like certain expensive restaurants	just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself	1651.951470933497
16473. in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he	spent part of each week studying	1247.0014228408095
16474. no	i take classes with different people he said	391.40710116454267
16475. i don't	think i've reached the point yet where i can say i know everything	i ought to know about the craft	2184.320896923377
16476. besides it's important to the	way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an	atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as du^rer	went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna	6205.9357238047105
16477. he made	a circle with his thumb and fingers	261.76364343208627
16478. painting isn't this big	you know	65.92641742111995
16479. it doesn't embrace only the artist alone before his easel	377.6245965601708
16480. it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous	749.4352168061483
16481. he threw his arms wide his face shining	165.6584161010571
16482. the artist is like	a fragment of a mosaic- no he is more than that a virtuoso performer	in some vast philharmonic	3280.645465817373
16483. one of these days i'm going to organize	a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being	painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism	and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists	have in common with each other	4683.566747219293
16484. the eye is all inward or outward	141.63291290618923
16485. ah what a title for the exhibition: the eye is all!	what do you study	1105.2110798617916
16486. i asked	0.30041514999999996
16487. i was fascinated; just listening	to him made me feel intelligent	503.96854797268327
16488. i'm studying anatomy	with burns he replied	140.91411865923567
16489. he teaches at	the manhattan school of art	166.4254480604917
16490. i had studied with burns	ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me	along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on	hudson street	4664.560377942917
16491. burns and i had not loved each other	167.95977647285048
16492. i'm also	studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice	a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton	3502.0741961278013
16493. my god is he still alive	43.36574854389876
16494. he must	be a million years old	142.51180619623216
16495. i went to a retrospective of his work when	i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of cezanne's	2035.2107811492328
16496. he's about sixty	now	4.439704874821324
16497. still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful	canvases of mountains and farms	938.6465723786794
16498. he even makes the city look like	one of thoreau's hangouts	758.1058599562672
16499. i've always admired him and when i	heard he was taking a few pupils i went to him and joined his class	2179.4621936167637
16500. yes it sounds great i said but suppose you	don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter	2124.6312742700998
16501. you're	missing the point he said	43.27806900458303
16502. he has the magical eye	22.363836819876347
16503. and	he is a great man	43.66008799455355
16504. contact with him is stimulating	22.245009236050766
16505. and that's	the trouble with so many artists today	262.26461373135834
16506. they	sit	alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating	themselves still farther from life	2815.5386570983164
16507. that's one of the reasons art	is becoming a useless occupation	503.6831938284208
16508. in the middle ages in the renaissance	right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant	in the world	3290.767652365069
16509. he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and	developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did	2326.925337432105
16510. he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning	it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its	beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses	4973.49717209219
16511. he was a propagandist-	they weren't afraid of the word then- satirist nature	lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party	and of no party	2976.0705830514335
16512. but look at us today! we hold safe little jobs	illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels	and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out	of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity	6795.77082735384
16513. a bunch	of amateur dervishes! what we need is to get back to the group to	learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school	2601.5178958121855
16514. the upshot of the evening was that i got the	address of pendleton's studio- or rather of the studio in which	he gave his classes for he didn't work there himself- and joined	the life class which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve	in the morning	7331.271613550502
16515. it was an awkward hour but i didn't have to	punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay	a	couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job	4023.728395330794
16516. after	a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they	wouldn't feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the	brush-off reading out to work	5631.5220339594825
16517. it was mostly for the benefit of	the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us	1244.8696575499698
16518. in	a way askington was right	64.75648575963363
16519. stimulating was the word for it	43.35073356814712
16520. i don't know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it	to be	1882.883788146509
16521. partly it was because pendleton himself wasn't what i anticipated	374.9206376308624
16522. i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic	and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars	4451.641928784047
16523. no that isn't quite fair	14.768411277495673
16524. actually there was a lot	of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting	after a week	3690.7750313920346
16525. such a little thing to start with- the car registration	376.4885837683911
16526. ida where is the car license	65.94628388102758
16527. she asked	0.20041515
16528. i can't	find it in the glove compartment	252.18320900298244
16529. via must have it	i answered readily enough recalling her last visit	632.8126608413666
16530. why should via have it	22.100833498893117
16531. had	she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually	owned had been divided among the children	1889.3556313985184
16532. i was silent	0.30041514999999996
16533. i	didn't want to stir things up	93.27435372189518
16534. i drive my own car by courtesy	of via	391.7015355111424
16535. i'm sure she'd turn it over to you	if you'd rather	501.35458391784584
16536. she looked as if she were	accusing me of some fraud	748.0835027107495
16537. she must have taken the registration	when she went to walter's	501.0626115492458
16538. no	thank you	0.30041514999999996
16539. i want nothing of via's	14.811402203981615
16540. why should this	suddenly assail her	64.69450254409986
16541. walter was giving me checks for my pay the	household bills	502.2583938558065
16542. had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped	her mind	1182.4417998661615
16543. what a fool i've been she said quietly	166.70684658517695
16544. i knew all this but i paid no attention	391.3044293708007
16545. i don't even own the	house i'm standing in	261.0453840287536
16546. i was so sure it was all temporary h that	we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things	h   it narrows down down down and finally there is no	way out	5924.771159579352
16547. if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing	497.93348085690184
16548. i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark	but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge	in	3689.7731990165835
16549. i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself	and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful	the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast	and dinner and enjoying living	4639.411143865698
16550. so i went about my business	65.67786926322256
16551. i made	a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some	frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for	the weekend	2873.5038227598443
16552. don't bother ida she said	22.19027999887045
16553. i have these	appointments in town for saturday and i'll probably spend sunday	with dolly or the thaxters	1570.6076216259703
16554. at last i thought she's	recovering her spirits	250.6756081675806
16555. with this movie-to-be in london and new faces	about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person	all the better for her stay out here	3094.5783944968657
16556. i felt more cheerful as if i	had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself	3045.530974794179
16557. and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch	of life	1256.6859815278926
16558. it was foggy that evening but the path to my house was	so well grooved that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to	the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river	and sometimes last for days	6668.084715202061
16559. in the morning the fog was still thick	so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on	2319.604967126408
16560. i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the	woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the	fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for	town	6720.31673718135
16561. i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i	went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed	plans for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk was beginning to	gather when i drove home in the late afternoon	4625.114672423653
16562. but the next	day- sunday	22.20364834660077
16563. why when i drove down to church didn't it speak	to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear	2321.13983866373
16564. prisoners	brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot	remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe	that the mind can remove absent itself unsee	5197.753279626366
16565. when i came back	from church at noon mrs thaxter was turning into the salter driveway	1261.5890683410435
16566. even at a car's length i could sense that something was wrong	and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house	4082.5962294467963
16567. dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came	running toward us	944.3132323934535
16568. she's nowhere nowhere! she screamed	and both women ran up to the house and i followed	1888.5585973900172
16569. the	search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets	talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps	1572.0591067073847
16570. everything was as	i had left it the night before last- her portfolio and bag for town	her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out h only her mink coat was	missing	5165.5033968001535
16571. i who until	that day before had been mrs salter's friend her equal was the	servant now	1415.1932859871615
16572. it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via	everybody	750.7350207973678
16573. and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not	to me	783.3405424569557
16574. and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back	to my place in the kitchen and wait	3056.954345569037
16575. sitting in the kitchen	i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign	to me	1725.21928461241
16576. if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing	952.6761171045534
16577. why didn't that alarm me then	43.09458059308761
16578. and when she returned from taking	her guests back to new york she had said all they talked about	was harvie h harvie this harvie that h when they know the	truth will they drop away from me will i become a nothing	6702.102160594468
16579. and	then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short	trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the	boat people liked me for myself	3675.0946096541497
16580. i had made a habit of calling	her at night from my cottage just to check	1890.0708838320588
16581. the last night i	had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me	1252.6321849897809
16582. i assumed	it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance	she comfortable in bed	2116.0915182443123
16583. but it seemed not from what they were saying	258.3907068895013
16584. then was it a final desperate plea from her to whom	756.7587332449314
16585. h hanging	on and on past any man's patience h some final stab of conclusion	1097.991032718822
16586. she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff	969.8540524463573
16587. i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless	disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the	night as she had a habit of doing	3447.0373957412244
16588. sometimes she took the path that	winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff	2834.0079559050614
16589. it's	so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming	in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of	the night so poetic	3345.82080067505
16590. with all that warm rain and the fog it might have	been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep	2840.4077150286166
16591. but i didn't	really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else	1092.9728432302904
16592. when a	fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a	child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant	that i still cannot account for	5462.25096779461
16593. was it a hysterical release	from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks	936.893233768568
16594. that at last the	vigilance the will gives way	393.6475338093032
16595. or what was it that before via	sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and	cry out i knew she'd do it! i knew!   everyone stared	at me and drew back	3741.939512381198
16596. their eyes turned cold and accusing even	via's	251.76532861952154
16597. and they have never changed	14.787865956984245
16598. at the same time that	i thought	i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing	had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring	envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry	6272.628018665066
16599. was that what had given	way in me	166.6064127836028
16600. even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows	of what they really are	1631.8702470587168
16601. it is absurd of course to say that that one	exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but	there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with	each other	3840.7028389326088
16602. at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation	but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight	of me was painful to them after that outcry	5298.229298900224
16603. in my person they would	always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they	told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that	by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat	for what is not to be borne	4987.861884123498
16604. it is not their avoidance	that rankles; it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of	the	family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk	away	that it hurts	6039.606626823908
16605. i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had	cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body	2175.1388082330154
16606. no i forget	mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when	it happened	1876.933728710496
16607. she haunted me; she persisted in explaining how and why	she had advised mrs salter to return to the country	1878.8945808377325
16608. we	all feel guilty i turned away from her coldly	560.255345119854
16609. she overplayed her hand	2.9276286340681263
16610. what do you mean	4.434275314929099
16611. she frowned	0.20041515
16612. why put such a high value on being top	dog	563.3080931574175
16613. i added	0.20041515
16614. it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal	and she has never come to see me since	2117.3274701320233
16615. but suppose she	had not taken mrs mathias' advice and lived on like thousands	of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and	altogether and finally arid	3209.063179870794
16616. if she chose and in that final decision	discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she	not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self	felt at last the passion of a great moral decision	6508.123963821892
16617. if they say i	could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks	of self-examination her search into herself and its conclusions	2836.636346872115
16618. yes i had cried out that i knew she'd do it but without	my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise	at her deliverance from pettiness and greed- and guilt	6014.965740567137
16619. she was	finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice	787.860432779628
16620. at rest with	my darling ellen the first mrs salter	564.3584234515484
16621. the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister	how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing	beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to	strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in	accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to	mud so the burial had to be postponed	5610.70108630175
16622. then via called to	say they had decided to cremate her- as they had ellen the thought	leaped to my mind- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home	the next morning	5636.28085817631
16623. the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of	the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the	sheaf of white roses i had ordered	3099.320427117468
16624. i knelt just for decency i	thought at the time but found myself whispering our father which	art in heaven h and it was only after that that something unlocked	in me and i felt a grief	5902.445914000206
16625. via was in the parking lot when	i went outside	374.9497369715054
16626. together we waited in her car until the hearse moved	out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey	3461.7339284532586
16627. by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music	was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet	symbols of religious faiths	2723.2403779665774
16628. again i felt impelled to kneel	and reached back and pulled via down	1183.2837843411126
16629. something would come into her	heart h if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing	1732.5685177145547
16630. i had a rather small place of my own	391.03007928397744
16631. a nice bachelor apartment in	a place called the lancaster arms	503.4288639048291
16632. uhhu she said	hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid	754.4499674342298
16633. and then	i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio	793.3477084925157
16634. i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends	carla he said wanting her to know all about him	2817.2885687639528
16635. oh	i'd drink with newspaper people	43.387279329173836
16636. i think i was what you might call	a convivial man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing	my work that i really felt alive	4816.352325069396
16637. but i think a man needs at least	one intimate friend to communicate with	938.43944261739
16638. pausing he waited for	her to turn to ask a question	746.7144995214115
16639. she showed no interest at all in the	life he had led back home and it hurt him a little	1888.3792473718422
16640. well what	about you carla	22.330542826296828
16641. me	0.20041515
16642. she asked turning slowly	4.437051088446345
16643. what about me	0.20041515
16644. did you make friends easily	22.334182577992685
16645. umm uhhu	0.20041515
16646. somehow i imagine that as you grew	up you were alone a lot	1186.2492112652258
16647. how about it	0.20041515
16648. i guess so	she said taking a kleenex from her purse	754.9591120804031
16649. when she had wiped some	of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the	mirror	1881.3191808467345
16650. are your people still alive	22.1401099538046
16651. he asked trying	to touch a part of her life alberto hadn't discussed; so he	could	have something of her for himself	2165.559658639936
16652. you talk so well carla	he went on	249.62578905701852
16653. you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift	for words he added trying to flatter her vanity	2034.6841342074808
16654. you must have	been good at history at school	388.555378241908
16655. where did you go to school	43.56035711445322
16656. what is this	0.30041514999999996
16657. she asked turning suddenly	2.9378606327876136
16658. don't	you know all about me by this time	388.6274206790566
16659. my name's carla caneli	2.9612910719156638
16660. i sleep with you	4.463369159641624
16661. you know something more about me every	day don't you	377.27299870080833
16662. would you be happier if i made up some stories	about my life told you some lies	2132.41432884667
16663. why are you trying to worry	me	92.81058011887248
16664. i'm not trying to worry you	65.21151368971626
16665. the cleansing tissues she had been using had	been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another	hoping she would notice what he was doing	3354.2586354951213
16666. at home he had been	a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance	2126.200678512997
16667. was she just	naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance	500.7375484671428
16668. he	wondered	0.30041514999999996
16669. would he have to clean up after her every day clean the	kitchen the bathroom and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen	floor then hang up her dresses pick up her stockings make the bed	while she lay around	4388.459901663495
16670. he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation	then grew afraid	750.3448722029583
16671. if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered	he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose	his view of her too	2856.9262031524663
16672. what's the matter	0.30041514999999996
16673. she asked	suddenly	0.20041515
16674. nothing at all he said quietly	64.75189430477201
16675. are those the only shoes you have sam	168.32102504886427
16676. what's the matter with them	22.13420561947821
16677. the	heavy thick soles	2.9595385768290003
16678. they're an expensive	english shoe for walking around a lot	561.5153592343921
16679. sam	no one around here wears such heavy soles	262.24155259210534
16680. can't you get another	pair	22.234300580063
16681. maybe i could he said surprised that she	could turn from herself and notice anything about him	1413.805814588896
16682. i'll get	an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoes tomorrow carla	751.0684127405094
16683. and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit	she said making a face	1577.4259417523172
16684. what's the matter with it	22.117538366496795
16685. he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the	fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had	encountered her on the street	3350.7805165318605
16686. you look like a tweedy	englishman	65.74157501510226
16687. can't you wear something else and look a little	more as though you belonged	950.4476959372835
16688. i don't mind at all	he said delighted with her attention	746.8833455673768
16689. changing his clothes he put	on his dark-blue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the	feeling that he might be putting it aside for good	2977.5707687944423
16690. but it was a hopeful	sign he told himself	390.6590020042101
16691. she no longer wanted anything about him to	remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in	parioli	2029.698243367684
16692. that day they loafed around just getting the feel	of the city	965.6903507460754
16693. they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower	via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens	2187.019685262382
16694. she had some	amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days	968.0268752445388
16695. then they took	a taxi to trastevere	93.90559789846972
16696. there's a church you should see she	said	252.30678658666494
16697. and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at	santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been	there with alberto	3233.1802506992376
16698. he let her tell him all about the church	393.93771642098375
16699. all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself	260.500798554097
16700. when they got home at midnight she was tired out	555.4303957149898
16701. and in the morning	when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing	1098.8850590525458
16702. he	had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought	of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the	obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps	6346.931940847597
16703. it was a good	thing that she clung to her religion he thought	784.608874094384
16704. she might like to	take him to st peter's	391.19185275971023
16705. carla wake up he said	shaking her	93.10992095897436
16706. aren't you going out to mass	64.29880643623852
16707. you could take me to st peter's	93.50890537568839
16708. come on you'll be late	22.246502661336628
16709. i think	i'll sleep in this morning she said drowsily and as she snuggled	against him he wondered if she ever went to church	2470.845260421157
16710. why did he	want her to go to church	391.2665011450959
16711. he wondered h probably because it was	a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security	1731.4021828347481
16712. it would	be good for her	64.67975754668365
16713. it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church	505.5281393887253
16714. not his poor mother's fault	22.27554207981504
16715. she would have been better off	if she had stuck to her bible	790.9953712900262
16716. as for himself he just didn't have	the temperament for it	751.0997525250513
16717. from the time he had been at college he had	achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that	there were certain things he could never know	3122.979305420299
16718. then he thought of those	old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel	1645.9816036029583
16719. just	figures out of a tribal folklore	93.42297053221199
16720. could he honestly believe it would	be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination	now	2571.463912127812
16721. being a woman though she would take only what she needed	from church	795.5155518449292
16722. it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself	393.4888335207794
16723. or a	protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox	communist	1102.2729529600233
16724. what was the matter with him that they all wearied	him	750.17412610371
16725. it was the times he was sure	93.15493026986202
16726. all the ideologies changing from	day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one	of them for an enlargement of his freedom	4655.947277300586
16727. it was all too wearying	14.898160991592864
16728. but where	0.30041514999999996
16729. just the same he thought pondering	over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she	got up and went to church	2874.0538407348536
16730. a half hour later he got her up to	go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the	stairs would think they were going to a late mass	4995.4489792995955
16731. it seemed to him	that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would	help him to feel more sure of himself with carla	2850.919300158698
16732. since we're	having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think	i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean	for us	4808.497599412569
16733. and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it	sam	941.9415015463052
16734. there's so little to do	22.293036247447112
16735. i'm not good at that kind of thing	165.47875544320647
16736. this afternoon	let's take an air with them	249.395287955612
16737. let's be fine superior people of	great dignity he said as if he were joking	1093.4647691906514
16738. if you	find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair	1415.4944223025723
16739. i am what i am	14.760061664063334
16740. her words remained with	him worrying him for hours	392.5282611494138
16741. he didn't know how she would behave with	other people	373.8854446322806
16742. when they walked into the ferraro apartment	the old lady bowing and smiling said softly	1650.9860786594509
16743. ciao and	put	out her hand	42.85317915374772
16744. her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed	and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things	3041.703751983576
16745. agnese	smiling too said 'ello and then more slowly i	am happy	641.2256592560809
16746. and they sat down and began their little coffee party	558.6260340153023
16747. the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee	166.68521498779813
16748. acting only as	interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal	1400.484033164564
16749. she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again	635.1820404814532
16750. watching	her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being	bounced back and forth	2599.7961625592225
16751. signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly	asked sam about canada having a special interest	944.701392506211
16752. the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from	a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who	had migrated to canada to work on the railway	5652.628859288159
16753. for a year the boy	had lived in the bush in a boxcar	793.8603572881143
16754. did many of sam's countrymen live	in boxcars in the bush	750.5340254337227
16755. had sam ever lived in a boxcar	94.25571211107601
16756. she	wanted to know	4.440437487807055
16757. regretfully sam explained that he had no experience	with boxcars	375.0461779271635
16758. just the same the old woman said she would write to her	nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted	country	4678.251546553651
16759. and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew	back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope	2602.4761927118934
16760. a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black	eyes sparkling	1415.1345499858987
16761. it was	said that he had had a vision	263.84518521511944
16762. just as thousands that day in portugal	had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later	in his own garden and she turned to agnese for confirmation	5361.3076096821005
16763. agnese	had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware	640.2978938755584
16764. now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in	her eyes	1645.6886587545814
16765. the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she	could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man	who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great	rulers of the world	4298.285438990282
16766. yes the pope could die and quickly be made a	saint	754.6700403486864
16767. no he was indeed a saint now	94.01154477689968
16768. nodding approvingly and swelling	with importance the old lady whispered confidentially	753.4720300382781
16769. there was	a certain discontent among the cardinals	168.3042533121243
16770. the pope in the splendor	of his great intellect had neglected them a little	1415.8442096950378
16771. there would be changes	made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope	died it was like the end of a regime in rome	2587.092995891556
16772. jobs would be lost and	new faces would become prominent	560.942795859638
16773. did signor raymond understand	2.966928986497739
16774. indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carla's	eye	748.904501268483
16775. surely she could see that these women were her italians too	he thought	788.0074684280729
16776. devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in	brooklyn or malta or ireland	1897.6591095279805
16777. but carla; eyes were on agnese	whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness	1890.0671796253555
16778. and carla watching in wonder turned to sam	250.29135397843024
16779. it means	so much to her	43.00031861373967
16780. it's like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy	tone	961.7283615533845
16781. but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's	lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself	2031.2909309868423
16782. with	the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill	caressing the flageolet with his lips making it whisper	3492.1590593424808
16783. he saw her	emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her	head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter	as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass	by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach	4841.654397268749
16784. in her dark	scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing	not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding	4265.056027113218
16785. seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart	bounce in him and turned away afraid now	1582.2763036301062
16786. even he wanting her	afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences	in her metabolism more	3465.7445292104917
16787. his breath caught and trembling he	closed his eyes and stumbled off	645.1647008527607
16788. going he saw as often before some	queer hideous yellow face over his head shining and weird like the	old images	which had invested him at other times like those that appear	sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs	6815.006999971379
16789. he cried out to her his back turned	166.851229185068
16790. then he fled not	waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry	2120.828570028452
16791. but	she heard him go	14.999118371586766
16792. yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly	her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way	toward the end of the camp	4676.161282546787
16793. elsewhere others heard and stopped	and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in	small curious clusters	1727.7534656040978
16794. early spring came from her bed from beside	her half-drunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to	her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices	4837.717602601295
16795. standing	there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop	beside the lodge silent almost imperious her body taut simply standing	without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited perhaps	denying the dread that moved in her	4368.416564274533
16796. when at last she could suffer	the insult no longer nor face the girl's scorn she said in a	voice overloud:   i shall call your father! go back where	you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed	so he can see your shame!   but the girl said only tell	him i am here that i have come	8727.266246713622
16797. and it was not pile of clouds	she meant	260.3031741392147
16798. but now with real anger at last something proud	and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den	and cried i will not shriek at you! i will tell you to go not	begging	5933.289670904314
16799. telling you! and unsheathing the knife she used for	curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her	side	2334.3459896866207
16800. you bring only wickedness she said and it was not	to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her	lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal	5446.9213959560175
16801. speaking in a low voice	of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright	scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife	3111.3995870757226
16802. go	take helsq'iyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the	woman said	1189.1677688244283
16803. they do not have to face battle	93.83049401526429
16804. i will not let your	evil in	139.74947291897266
16805. i will simply kill you first	43.95132484692222
16806. now go!   the other	women had come close now their voices murmuring together until they	stood buzzing in an angry knot their threats mingling rising nagging	at each other each trying to make her indignation and anger felt	6026.965596050299
16807. they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl	376.242296138934
16808. the sticks fell	like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny	points of pain along her thighs	3679.5247759197177
16809. they were all shouting at her as	if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought	1416.7096239215873
16810. but she did not	move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme	youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging	a great bullhide whip	5319.668351479264
16811. go back to your lodges! he	shouted	93.72384202376303
16812. a pack of dogs makes less noise! he made the long	whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some	tripping over themselves in their flight	4854.3301358315275
16813. and early spring seized	the whip and said:   if you must flog someone let it be her	your daughter	1725.209185899268
16814. drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay	away from my husband! but the old man turned on her jerking the	whip from her hand	4451.400941369232
16815. get into your hovel! he spat	43.679488793657754
16816. go	back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body	among the young women	2350.9968480306607
16817. keep him back if you must tell me what to	do	500.9485939318565
16818. i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who	leads her to sin!   she retreated before the naked shame	in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her	lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor	to say:   what worrisome thing happens	8125.967592033341
16819. i thought i	dreamed of wolves fighting	93.9428557811963
16820. but she went to him and pressed herself	against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had	stolen from tuhulhulzote	3497.811381512188
16821. she said there is nothing	that concerns you here	261.93843032531123
16822. lie back and go to sleep	65.73210280511799
16823. do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain	260.7914302055615
16824. he sank back	sighing and was soon asleep again	392.70413896905296
16825. outside the old man	beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and	twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her	and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent	out a thousand arms	4886.900747602767
16826. and shoving her against a spruce her back to	him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp	air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound	of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders	while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her	eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close	to her face	0.30166232349522504
16827. she said to him her father how was i begotten	in pain or joy	936.600658555976
16828. is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made	grow on me	1411.1899924768634
16829. they all know your foolish name!   she stared	at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from	it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark	3666.508145774177
16830. she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables	words which had no meaning like unnnt! h sssshoo! the	sounds of an animal in rage and despair	4996.820527515238
16831. suddenly the lash	stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high	quavering voice:   did you follow me to see my shame	2855.167478868212
16832. move from the line or i will settle the whip on you h	1190.8493142076718
16833. move! do	you hear the anger of the whip's whine	374.36847806643084
16834. turning the	girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his	arms hanging long and resigned	2112.533129413919
16835. he said let me take her blows	for there are demons in me too	931.3393068438163
16836. then without knowing why	she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees	dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky	ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid	listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry	7961.955711545919
16837. for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tu	hul hul zote glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself	2601.023487291258
16838. he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling	970.1647139900188
16839. he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles	in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great	gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his	own oblivion	3940.2865918769976
16840. he amused the young men who had been silent long enough	752.2197652091799
16841. but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution	through his antics	789.7059034541336
16842. now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again	disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them	2352.313874858179
16843. they	came out and held their games and races	260.6639511971307
16844. it was they who held the	future in their hands	556.0299979914315
16845. they went into the sun together and paraded grandly	in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis	dug far off in the cave of skeletons	2995.435310471208
16846. they danced the paxam	wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom	of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their	few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal	5766.98807108945
16847. walitzee	was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like	broad wings in the air of their passing	2176.665934772221
16848. and a very young one swan	necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly	1409.1133042315657
16849. yellow wolf	was there nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead	in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked	2458.7716482099977
16850. he would spring	bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because	something had boiled over in his fermenting juices	2816.34774980087
16851. all the	young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing	640.7586845200133
16852. they	raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file	and then abreast like cavalry	2119.9277589349963
16853. at times they would ride frenziedly through	the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they	were in their regalia	2185.264613730839
16854. then again they would stand in circles making	other preparations	561.7468937290616
16855. they combed their hair and streaked it at the part	and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood	rigid like the tails of sage hens making love	3343.146943918154
16856. walitzee whitened	his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in	the trees	1893.9879874643725
16857. he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a	speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness	shining and scented with meadow rue	3343.9394686552996
16858. he was always aware of the women's	eyes which followed him admiring him	1188.9499588477843
16859. and the suspicious envenomed	eyes of pile of clouds	259.8504686423097
16860. and those of early spring haunted	and now	full of hurt and envy	1182.1054770512728
16861. he felt so much like laughing; even	like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend	as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs	3251.269576422705
16862. he and sarpsis	planned a great parade with the young men	760.2637127619047
16863. they would give one final	testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance	1253.231609067741
16864. they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the	sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death	3699.407631592751
16865. and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was	the young men's blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry	which ran with their hearts	3333.1569792077853
16866. they mounted their horses and rode off	into the hills	569.0976378014
16867. the young chief stared at the wall of his	lodge listening	504.40348006606473
16868. the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished	and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of	the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell	5812.710720739575
16869. he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across	the ridge	1261.8838264994395
16870. standing then with the others peering into the sun	he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners	only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the	hoofs accompanying them	5829.006867994207
16871. they leaned into the wind and seemed like one	thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose	straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated	their grotesque cry of war	3662.3910649182812
16872. she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white	birch and maples	1649.1938272072064
16873. the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her	ears	502.54785167679245
16874. she stood	once more listening	22.493129504497382
16875. she had never been here at this	hour	167.16187490931722
16876. she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch	at her arm; but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches	she had broken those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily	now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water	beneath her	7739.001109008297
16877. if i ever committed suicide she thought i	would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days	2186.099873111868
16878. she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known	root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves	2569.321496924887
16879. she jumped	out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her short-cut	brown hair and tilted her chin far upward	2309.4535152141825
16880. the reedy music of the	frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until	it was vibrant	2802.1373901583165
16881. julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped	her hands tightly around the bent knees	1571.699302155968
16882. she had accomplished a miracle	22.340830041204715
16883. the hour couldn't change it h	43.430615115274776
16884. only-	only- her thoughts were a little strange	249.63108250857908
16885. perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had	no business to be here now	1577.1174033139691
16886. she was thinking of paul a few	weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday	evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend	4990.855297761873
16887. hello julie how are you	14.956120133301066
16888. h and then off he went so casually	to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a	lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability	to find words that would hold him	6062.277297541548
16889. i wish he was with me now she	thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once	only pretense and acute embarrassment	2976.218455181839
16890. oh god! i wish i were	older or younger julia bentley thought	964.8627830753885
16891. i wish so much someone loved	me	93.60501293880783
16892. george rawlings remembered seeing the door	open sometime during the night- millie in a white robe standing	like a ghost at the threshold	3494.804305753295
16893. she had vanished; he must have slept	again	166.63940058805102
16894. he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him	962.2114920625905
16895. it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course	the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday	morning	2981.602789312727
16896. this room was like a prison	65.36876999541914
16897. he would not be indebted	to sam! below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard	the humming of a vacuum cleaner	2734.8743967065084
16898. his fingers fumbled across the bandages	64.97183463095267
16899. they had left both of his eyes uncovered h	262.4949987949309
16900. well he told himself	let's put the show on the road	759.2205308957896
16901. he was walking across	to the bathroom	93.80574709881549
16902. he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with	both hands	1183.1894314455008
16903. a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water	were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them h	2330.788192693051
16904. he	recognized	his jacket and trousers	65.27629116850507
16905. the fabric was dark; the stains weren't	too apparent; and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt	was one terrible mess	2323.6362984663074
16906. he shivered and then tore away the	blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf	2607.800871019605
16907. sam would be amazed to find him gone	165.71898383689415
16908. millie would have to understand	22.22773653254219
16909. she must have put his clothes in the closet	263.29115584635247
16910. he found a lump rising	in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness	1876.9430617618023
16911. he was on	the verge of tears	94.09738163752584
16912. alex poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt	to that effete gentleman	1188.1963777565113
16913. at least alex had told him he wasn't dying	263.2602894177066
16914. perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead	251.95624899750868
16915. what	time was it	2.934656529649969
16916. he peered at his wristwatch	22.04551943443506
16917. strange it was still running	14.689294157149604
16918. too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably	sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs	2602.6970980133265
16919. he	was kneeling to tie his shoelaces	93.75291982490893
16920. his fingers felt absurdly thick	and clumsy	141.30364792827035
16921. he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of	the closet door	1104.1906717222469
16922. this was some freak two	strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass	of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones	3887.002400319225
16923. the surface however	was perfectly white	43.43455922919015
16924. he was drinking another glass of water	139.2156738620683
16925. it was after seven o'clock	14.916797673465354
16926. he was supposed to be in court this afternoon	at city hall	951.5858550114181
16927. who would take over	2.968138827967933
16928. he'd have to think	but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam	bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy	4478.783719415884
16929. he was actually walking down the	stairs	94.55259761795425
16930. a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish	wreck of a man desperately trying to get away	3029.5929255599476
16931. father is	that you	2.977635447596268
16932. the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below	564.4844940090745
16933. is that you father	2.9368370031030286
16934. h who's there	0.30041514999999996
16935. for a moment he felt like a thief discovered	261.27780689270287
16936. then julia	appeared under the arch leading to the dining room	753.4167802147905
16937. she stood gazing	at him	14.847943388935676
16938. uncle george!   he was trying to smile	at her	389.57745778044114
16939. gosh! you shouldn't be up should you	94.46429123876764
16940. i- i was just leaving here julie h	253.46360349498792
16941. just	about to call a taxi	43.63378175226506
16942. she was wearing some sort of gray	blazer	249.4380459079262
16943. she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern	261.0522021150853
16944. well	at least you won't have to do that she was saying	959.7678806207869
16945. i'm	about to leave myself	14.845546328485037
16946. you're	leaving	0.30041514999999996
16947. i'm going back to school she answered	93.49566035856864
16948. i'm just finishing breakfast h	22.328362809924933
16949. but	have you told mother you were going	165.98613643769806
16950. she asked him	0.30041514999999996
16951. i just don't want anyone disturbed julie	93.63345534694814
16952. it's quite a big one he added	141.75603299040765
16953. her face seemed to	float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight	638.3856072089455
16954. well won't you	come in then have a cup of coffee- or something	1177.90894245975
16955. h or maybe	a drink	14.916792096349422
16956. she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate	and yet perhaps partly scornful	1641.0999325603684
16957. he tried to see her face	more clearly	167.73449815865266
16958. no- nothing at all he said after a moment's	hesitation	563.4270837845731
16959. i'll just wait for you here	43.696048548622485
16960. he leaned	his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red	images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids	3269.105616083065
16961. julia moved past	0.20041515
16962. i have to say good-by upstairs	65.45602852077229
16963. as a great favor julie he said please	don't mention you've seen me	788.8204179758646
16964. not to anyone	0.30041514999999996
16965. no- please h	0.20041515
16966. i'll call your mother as soon as	i get home	561.15476413481
16967. it'll be so much easier	14.801171316770786
16968. all right h	she was staring at him	249.45304205218
16969. please	you just go ahead	14.917344568252236
16970. he could feel a	pulse pounding against the bandages	392.9276372689773
16971. he imagined sam's voice: george	what the hell goes on	375.4892624435697
16972. i wouldn't have the strength	to answer he thought	390.3411588886455
16973. maybe i couldn't have called a taxi	93.73904100055698
16974. he could hear the footsteps overhead	65.44764069190208
16975. he saw the suitcase which	julia was holding	166.97401655780172
16976. i'll take that julie-	for you	65.76892988286684
16977. i can manage	0.20041515
16978. she went ahead of him	22.189417413356345
16979. outside the lincoln was parked	14.680071760726559
16980. he could	hardly believe he was getting in	249.3021853473991
16981. pietro was gazing at him in an insolent	disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter	937.2148962172945
16982. we'll	drop mr rawlings off in ardmore julia said and for the merest	second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants	3481.37737393493
16983. to the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this;	yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed	2167.7525583898396
16984. he could not stop	to analyze	64.70079371090594
16985. he had never felt particularly close to her	165.85478094941976
16986. carrie seemed	more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request	759.8767873962239
16987. i wish i didn't have to go back to school	she said and then i wish you lived in new york	2029.608097042906
16988. that's	in the opposite direction	22.087139684539302
16989. i wish i did he responded	43.39599610386006
16990. i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume and that	we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we	knew h he stopped speaking	4503.050150551999
16991. forget we ever knew what	14.708210135851951
16992. oh just sort of everything in general	140.140382437797
16993. she	said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace	260.48088378814117
16994. i know you	feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say	2125.485230261997
16995. i'm supposed	to joke about things aren't i	168.49651727289745
16996. h but sometimes life	can	be rather a disappointing business	563.2226781436226
16997. his voice seemed thick	and purposeless	43.68511865373872
16998. he could see the stone building	where he lived	391.6120120340325
16999. just a few more steps h	44.12804181717924
17000. abruptly he reached	into his pocket	65.5849983950648
17001. yes there was the key	14.985196754953344
17002. are you positive	you'll be all right by yourself	390.1617196232928
17003. she asked him	0.20041515
17004. for a	moment he smiled	22.23282343381784
17005. you've done me the greatest	possible service	94.53698081768178
17006. by myself i'll be fine	22.201532570254464
17007. take care	of yourself then	14.85781504847779
17008. you also h	0.30041514999999996
17009. it was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through	the courtyard he regretted it	941.982258137409
17010. he should have discovered a more	tender farewell	250.74752735241387
17011. someone shouted at him well! will you look	at george rawlings! what happened to you	1101.3867212357547
17012. i bumped	into a door handle george said	249.55236998251598
17013. george	walked steadily ahead into his entry	93.79068898467757
17014. his bandages seemed on fire	22.21882184309278
17015. he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it	637.3575475019366
17016. in the kitchenette	the raw whiskey made him gasp	393.380631931574
17017. just one or two swallows he	told himself enough to lessen some of the pain	1097.215553314606
17018. no millie i'm home h	22.384642817787412
17019. no really right as rain	h	43.742439900793954
17020. tell sam not to worry about the car	251.56329595230494
17021. i'll get it hauled away	h	43.68868428776575
17022. no please- no visit today- i'll be asleep h	393.4324786551365
17023. for god's	sake don't worry	14.759144751125072
17024. that upsets me more than anything h	141.67897871055783
17025. yes	sure	i'll see the doctor- this evening if you insist h	645.357780374915
17026. there was one more call to make	140.18477944388104
17027. joan did i wake you	14.888784070556174
17028. he asked	0.30041514999999996
17029. yes i thought you'd probably be up h	167.53362942348178
17030. look	sweetheart	some fool was h	65.29922105678678
17031. happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated	last night	166.8782055890513
17032. unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldn't	quite put it that way to the boss h	2579.007607302034
17033. oh hell no i'm not in a	hospital	166.83327383010354
17034. i won't be in town for a couple of days though and there's	that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon	3226.7567293173684
17035. too bad a jury	isn't involved	44.03682902150999
17036. i might struggle in for a jury	140.97969742343724
17037. but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me	374.1439769400557
17038. he'll	understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge	754.1646117553956
17039. he's	got all the facts	14.956936089894015
17040. i wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's	really just a routine thing h	1654.5229466344554
17041. what	0.20041515
17042. h no darling i'd	rather	you didn't come out	389.3071544276687
17043. a smile pulled at the lower strip of	adhesive tape	375.21111182221426
17044. i'll see you wednesday	4.419087369696351
17045. i'll bribe you with a nice- he was about to say double	martini but thought better of it	1565.7406694989081
17046. i'll take you out to dinner	64.3987725471448
17047. okay	0.20041515
17048. h	he had put down the receiver	142.04657702924175
17049. a strange relationship	between joan fulbright and himself	166.81911966236243
17050. who knew about it	4.39894529706599
17051. she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated	houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed	2465.1166335509743
17052. she	had two tiny rooms on the second floor	391.59718422009865
17053. she was a clever girl a most	efficient secretary	264.3190849073169
17054. she let him come and go as he pleased or as	it pleased her	1419.1582362701251
17055. in the office you might have thought them only casual	friends; yet	if he said: make an excuse yourself come out here today	she would have been on the next train- and similarly if she had	been in need he would have gone to her	4612.859918089922
17056. they make us conformists look good	65.48347687393746
17057. that's a peculiar	way to think	43.24704926876079
17058. it wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled	her own feathers of course; she knew that	2114.989050044879
17059. it was jim's little	sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway	myra	641.6559347870677
17060. she's a year older than i am lucy told herself	555.1170343968699
17061. come come jim said jollying lucy a little	165.888868088817
17062. susan ready	0.30041514999999996
17063. lucy listened	0.20041515
17064. upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her	room	563.9279730063124
17065. susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but	even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime	just in case	3100.968916162816
17066. every doll in the house must be going	with her	557.4669668888412
17067. she'd better step on it	14.779228400542317
17068. it's a long way	to websterville	64.51699264524015
17069. jim's fine young face was an expressive one	too; as he looked at her it registered anxiety	1422.1588314711885
17070. myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy	393.6315647142732
17071. it'll be	only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris-	but even so she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful	2984.8819174786295
17072. lucy did not believe him; myra appreciated nothing	251.84198672855555
17073. jim had	put the thanks in his sister's mouth	263.37955434890125
17074. darling- she	said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend	1658.179630830402
17075. she should have told me herself	42.85719712315603
17076. and will it be only a	couple of weeks	390.78904793605085
17077. remember what happened the last time	43.48098810122423
17078. leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly	brief visit; but she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed	all winter too- with them	4991.112816274837
17079. lucy suspected that myra would never	have come home if gregg myra's husband hadn't gone out to	fetch her	1716.6430219759557
17080. that was an awfully long two weeks	140.45871536911187
17081. for	an otherwise silent moment jim's keys jingled nervously in his	pocket	638.7123402158547
17082. but she promised- this will be different he said	at last	748.6367871904438
17083. you've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine	government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and cathy	in no time	2855.398214752862
17084. you'll see myra's settling down	22.36253898658558
17085. on the defensive	he added i wish you'd think what it must be like for her	to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow	2970.3194567178816
17086. it	depends on the widow	22.315101638782725
17087. lucy had an idea that myra loved it	165.98280666838934
17088. and	not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down	1183.2496505785105
17089. it	seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing	nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her	way of life	3206.3387817928206
17090. remembering that succession of disasters she now considered	cathy an ominous child-cloud on her horizon	1641.4897511525337
17091. it was	not that she disliked cathy	93.64327800520427
17092. the youngster drew her troubled her depths;	whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give	her the warmth she had never had from myra	4479.570800984477
17093. but cathy was myra's	responsibility not hers	94.04919257524355
17094. i wouldn't even be surprised	she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever	2094.0299223327033
17095. myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in paris	of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother	2173.345187376991
17096. lucy	knew her too well to find it impossible	389.28444923169735
17097. that's a horrible	thing to accuse her of! jim was so indignant it was obvious that	no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy	3324.1137548151864
17098. he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely	susan! susan! get moving!   a startled piping	sound returned	3041.6287599471616
17099. don't yell at us lucy said	43.131261061180375
17100. was	it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front	of the house looking at the moon-washed river	3463.191680768815
17101. their arms around	each other they had been talking of the present and the future;	their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in	light as the air around them	3770.9033268322974
17102. then from within the still sleeping	house the telephone had rung; myra with her news was on the other	end of the line	3473.4939562395166
17103. jim turned back from the stairway and looked	at her	376.10087005748767
17104. his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed	564.1800694118241
17105. there isn't a chance of myra's letting	anything like that happen	498.9868305331718
17106. but they	weren't just friends lucy thought; they were husband and wife	and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage	3273.456686200492
17107. the only	thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister	of his	1248.4715737004617
17108. lucy was sick of it	22.010110152233587
17109. well at last she said	because susan was clattering down the stairs	642.4159279429567
17110. susan	looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with	a burden of dolls	1868.6876240590732
17111. do you	need that big bundle	43.28578694829075
17112. jim said	0.30041514999999996
17113. his voice had sharp edges as	though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment	1878.53195370587
17114. all that junk	0.30041514999999996
17115. susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes	that gushed an instant grief; to her each of her dolls was a real	person with a living heart	2857.4041020185396
17116. now now lucy said approaching	susan with a handkerchief mopping skillfully	751.2967464393589
17117. your father	didn't mean it susan	43.358006909394994
17118. she gave jim a quick shape-up look of	warning	394.6858002233695
17119. he'll take every one of them	43.41301953794206
17120. jim groaned	but he lifted susan's suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure-	the entire thousand	2138.226072760929
17121. and when you get back from grandma's cathy	will be here to play with you	1100.5388163164405
17122. nice	0.30041514999999996
17123. no susan	said grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a scrooge-like	effect	940.0734191164387
17124. and at this point lucy thought there should be	a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize	with susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing too	4985.4100552713635
17125. that was one more reason she didn't look forward to cathy's visit	short or long; the last one had been a lilliputian war	2330.9125869904983
17126. she suspected	that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she	had never had	1890.0645433349032
17127. well jim said out of the silence let's	get going dolls and all	784.5944952946685
17128. when the car with susan's	hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the	driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust	3518.5395446856974
17129. the day was brilliant	around her- flower-scented crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil	darkened it	1254.5801431969503
17130. she had let jim go with a chilly good-by a chillier	kiss	971.3015740929529
17131. she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their	life together had she done that	1409.8580022379906
17132. she turned and began to walk toward	the house	393.17941309448975
17133. at the feeding station the raffish group of cowbirds	again bobbed and gobbled over the ground but now gorgeous among	them was a beautiful red cardinal radiant in its feathered vestments	3332.0166468741204
17134. the handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home silently	guarding their nest	1633.0168022581918
17135. she had better stay there lucy thought; the	sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels	1564.5600859817248
17136. well lucy	0.30041514999999996
17137. she said to herself abandoning the cardinals	and the cowbirds	376.3487594514178
17138. she had a day of things to do; among them she	had to prepare the guest room	2124.3875411236727
17139. how long would it be occupied	43.41225273664477
17140. she	wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness	252.6300301026784
17141. as long as the unscrupulous	myra chose	94.23639968154853
17142. for a moment her mind returned again to the	strange flying world of birds and she said to herself	2581.4779149170054
17143. it isn't	only birds that dump their children in other people's nests h	788.7919430728464
17144. in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready	guest room	1405.7253112720532
17145. there were new yellow curtains bright as a child's	life ought to be a new bedspread lively with hopping rabbits and hanging	from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile spinning slowly	in the breeze	3878.9275405549997
17146. a row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes	in the neatly empty closet; since myra had always put most of	greg's money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a	few of that long row would be needed	6691.695323993772
17147. the closet was faintly fragrant	with lavender and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into	her mind like a lavender ghost: greg's house on the day he	was buried and the child pale silent baffled watching the funeral	guests with panicky eyes	4639.049761375384
17148. many times since his death that memory had	worried and troubled her	956.6409924655333
17149. out in the hall the upstairs phone	shrilled and the small ghost vanished	797.0155652750029
17150. when she picked up the receiver	her mother's cheerful voice was there	958.816227192068
17151. websterville	junction calling she said	14.803741737111531
17152. i just thought i'd let you know	141.04448753908846
17153. myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left	susan a few hours ago	1421.647973186977
17154. i'd have phoned sooner but i've been	busy	251.99259734534667
17155. i can imagine! susan was an active character;	for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded	by her multitude of dolls	2720.7127508462227
17156. lucy drew out the chair and sat down;	she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her	3040.975115250326
17157. you	could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice	still kept its comforting magic	1577.6425378099261
17158. but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw	391.5731944585652
17159. on	her way to the airport on her way to paris- you bet lucy said	to herself	1406.7407046374053
17160. i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy	393.11983924684193
17161. there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long	is she supposed to stay	1408.1863540420566
17162. just for a couple of weeks	till myra finds a place for them	1180.230007571523
17163. well- this time	there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with	a voiceless life	1414.7872224269245
17164. puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper;	her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious	silences	2567.9292830267486
17165. was she thinking along the same lines lucy was- that	it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good	2159.2290206171847
17166. you	mean once myra gets to paris	140.19624604609297
17167. once the soft pretty moth	found the bright light she had always wanted	795.770792622789
17168. suddenly seekingly	lucy asked mother do you know something i don't know	967.7621486810565
17169. again there was that curious pause and then her mother	said i guess i do	1096.3145990375074
17170. just before myra left- she was saying good-by	to cathy and she didn't realize i was near	2101.4823721664643
17171. she hesitated	as though hunting over words and ways of putting them	641.641304907812
17172. cathy was	in tears of course and i heard myra say 'now be good and at	christmastime i'll send you a wonderful present from paris'	3899.8109709994196
17173. shocked speechless lucy sat there	14.741128652489738
17174. then she jumped to her	feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake	1647.4063044181214
17175. christmastime!	then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was	only too true	1099.6020942548473
17176. myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in	two weeks	959.8633511722716
17177. for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her	and when she found her voice anger thickened it	1568.9671969643791
17178. that does it!	she said	22.19027999887045
17179. i'll keep cathy for two weeks	43.24873324419478
17180. then if myra	does nothing about fetching her i'll pack her right back to her mother-	if i have to take her myself! her hand tightened on the	receiver	4632.709644043351
17181. and that's what i'm going to tell jim	165.57663309097822
17182. for	lucy the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end	959.8159109531098
17183. as she hung up she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black	flying of the cowbirds' wings and heard their grotesque singing	2344.076740353382
17184. cowbird myra! she's not going to get away with it	554.7231243617646
17185. cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the	path	638.4491712147591
17186. the child's thin legs were plodding	64.88067486875732
17187. she trudged along slowly	both hands clutching a tired teddy bear	502.9030752670672
17188. she was at the moment just	a small walking package being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's	house	2349.4197835420664
17189. unlike susan she was traveling light; the worn teddy	bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were	all she had	2606.3919171442917
17190. lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would	not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have	to buy things for her	4252.00383739708
17191. unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand	94.07821734021694
17192. quint couldn't blame	maggie for disbelieving	65.02884038256292
17193. for eleven days they'd done the same	thing leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast before esperanza	beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards	2873.9357299295266
17194. the swirling sand made quint's limp more pronounced	250.7467640410836
17195. they walked	slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages- eleven lemon nine mint	seven orange- around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats	sign jiggling in the wind	2986.6369972968255
17196. now they were in friendly territory	65.40840236366415
17197. nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping	jaggedly to the water's edge	948.0728031932088
17198. his rock was to the right of a	v-shaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers	2366.2338204503612
17199. his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here	951.5092030213284
17200. here he was enclosed and safe	65.52318509031991
17201. along didn't he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt- ten	here was a perfect place to lie	down and make believe	2470.242919174497

17204. he	was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size	and intrepid nature	2120.4541873281705
17205. he was six feet one like his father with big	hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to	2470.6664904339773
17206. every night when he wanted a drink of water didn't he practice	being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light	3056.413075664335
17207. a dark	bathroom can be pretty scary and he'd creep back to bed proud of	himself thinking: tomorrow for sure i'll go down to the rock	and keep my promise to dad	3449.097707591033
17208. he hadn't intended to make the	promise	139.78565800048062
17209. it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left	on a business trip to south america	1585.7300492500467
17210. every piece of the nightmare was	clear in place; and when he woke up his father was saying stop	screaming quint	3037.2866669611053
17211. he	could remember the feel of his father's big hands the thump of his	father's heart sending out signals- regular like radar	2176.538824841936

17221. victoria was fourteen months younger than quint a head taller	and could lick any boy or girl on the beach	1895.5136712141896
17222. she called him stuck-up- that's why nobody plays with	you mister stuck-up	969.6389250731869

17323. once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered don't	feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared	2592.6589768602526
17324. but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying	sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing	she was there smiling smelling of peppermints	5005.992151949015
17325. as for his promise-	oh he had plenty of time buckets of time	788.7380233584511
17326. they were eating breakfast	4.412812793066765
17327. we beseech thee lord	gord to bless this food- that was victoria saying grace while	the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib	2439.701976701497
17328. same old breakfast	till the phone rang making his mother's voice shake with excitement	1414.7253806360209
17329. your daddy's in san francisco she told	them	164.85974139326422
17330. he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane	391.1043318792863
17331. fifteen	days early- isn't that wonderful	43.22062530890223
17332. yeah keen	0.30041514999999996
17333. a cave seemed to be opening in quint's stomach	259.7101865577962
17334. children	we'll have to get organized	64.66044154514803
17335. the baby can have an early nap	93.51199255487523
17336. victoria	i want you to h   quint closed the screen door	quietly so maggie wouldn't	be scared	2131.37603599896
17337. hurry up we're late he	said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog	like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of	blue and kool-aid green	3868.6624928645806
17338. the cave in his stomach hurt	65.14756993607106
17339. he	had to go into the water	94.91170852166286
17340. he'd tell sabella about the nightmare	65.60582991789019
17341. it	had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung	789.9115851511594
17342. what caused	it he didn't know	65.32913329378806
17343. the metal collar gagging his neck	43.6376930114596
17344. sweating	so much	0.30041514999999996
17345. the unbearable weight on his chest	43.523166741844605
17346. all of it together	meant drowning	65.09558866615261
17347. the first time the nurse took him out of the lung she	said if he got frightened she'd put him back for a second	2469.0548865626706
17348. when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda	had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly	with it driving back from an afternoon's golf at oakmont it seemed	to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of	the community	7527.543133797961
17349. linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone	held his or her breath	936.1401983927983
17350. not that linda was heartless not that	she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john	cooper would	3278.7317084925467
17351. hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who	was the least bit of a disappointment all these years	1724.1133944067599
17352. wasn't	john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been	twenty-five years earlier	1663.733253973343
17353. and wasn't john's wife edythe	even more appalling if possible	376.2960357203434
17354. didn't john cooper after all	this time deserve something better of life	957.8226318302019
17355. wasn't it adult and	realistic to look at it that way	500.3868450662535
17356. and romantic	0.30041514999999996
17357. everybody	knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound	501.18944483335747
17358. it was	the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life and it was a tribute	to john's strength of character and very real business ability that	it hadn't ruined his	5165.745350842718
17359. of course there was nothing you could	do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen	mousie chandler said to linda stuart	2851.572236696678
17360. poor john! linda	accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all	her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds	the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains	and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young	men around pittsburgh	7867.830890488384
17361. for it had been john and linda ever	since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed	admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow	debs	3850.027147801029
17362. john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out	of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes	3483.255785696884
17363. you	saw them always together those years	93.57439004347728
17364. you talked about john-and-linda	as an entity	141.8133956640396
17365. john-and-linda were at longue vue last night;	john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours	1417.097617677132
17366. then there	was a spat over something as there had been lovers' spats before;	only this one didn't heal	2607.122550603962
17367. you still said john-and-linda	but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such	as the depression or dillinger	1889.4337067000677
17368. it got worse instead of better	64.94018122961938
17369. first	it came out after mr cooper's will was settled- he had died	the year before- that john and his mother weren't rich any more	2599.1491983348255
17370. and then there was linda's engagement to bobbie evans	390.0163517401626
17371. there was no connection between the two events because bobbie wasn't	rich either though he was more aggressive than john	1881.378973868824
17372. he was	a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same	steel company as john did	3043.3206609358695
17373. some people said linda had just	announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john	came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe	his bride it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental	wishful thinkers	4474.742120587531
17374. it wasn't even john and edythe	65.26125669000636
17375. it was simply	poor john	14.775460489589658
17376. there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe	but there was absolutely nothing right about her either	1874.9040713015966
17377. mousie	chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and	tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at horne's	2718.5023165610182
17378. well you shouldn't underestimate edythe	mousie said	139.1170635415019
17379. i know she gives the impression of being shallow and	frivolous and scatterbrained	788.744547135109
17380. she is frivolous and scatterbrained but	she really isn't shallowh	565.5206549375366
17381. bobbie and linda looked	magnificent at their wedding	167.80437085386546
17382. john was at the church with edythe	141.2233590929717
17383. she	giggled during the ceremony and mousie chandler who was one of	linda's bridesmaids said john glared black as death at her	2176.3712645544356
17384. as	if he were choking she said	139.9247992147892
17385. poor john!   edythe	settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example	945.7386579222251
17386. her hair	never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct	length	2109.1833804221833
17387. she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the	pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart	2460.331327884158
17388. and	you didn't see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted	away from the gang	2597.89597893231
17389. mousie said it was because he was too proud	to stand pity	640.7157627175677
17390. others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda mrs	bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything	2567.4878141820523
17391. there were less-dramatic reasons too	14.805963308918995
17392. john's mother	died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money	left	1878.4584710275856
17393. john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller	house in fox chapel	1264.3650192493592
17394. he was not reduced to poverty but his job	at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing	the day	4095.7806903274723
17395. john was good at his job	43.254955589915475
17396. it probably wasn't hard	for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe	to come home to	3022.9221111397096
17397. though that may be unfair since ben cooper john's	first son came along early in 1938 the cutest baby you ever saw	and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes	nary a trace of edythe	4206.140042825029
17398. but the continuing charm of the other	children- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944- and all john's success	at his work only made edythe's dizziness and general uselessness	more glaring	5028.229942985517
17399. she never could fit into a crowd which had known which	still knew and admired linda	1260.8939879734814
17400. when there was bridge at edythe's	house the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food	probably was wet graham crackers	3288.264041022291
17401. she managed a missionary drive	for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr	webber the eldest elder who'd never donated more than five dollars	to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal	in what edythe called the bosoms of the church	5038.160138775786
17402. john did find	the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually	oversubscribed	which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries	3904.36720252847
17403. being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought	about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile	2590.1873426790435
17404. poor	john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering	and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one	3490.4056124459457
17405. he was an attentive	and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they	knew that money must be a problem to him	2451.1129940189285
17406. but he got ahead in business:	on leave from his job to an important washington assignment	during the war; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel	company	4995.046752272174
17407. the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but	no more than was necessary	788.7629028504839
17408. bobbie had been successful too though he	didn't match john's pace and after all he didn't need to with	all the stuart money	3477.921147189275
17409. he and linda settled down to being social	leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year	1889.55538312412
17410. and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda	mourning alone and lovely	1652.790825480505
17411. everyone held his or her breath	43.56504002937013
17412. don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time	if she'd tried mousie gordon who had been mousie chandler	said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le	mont	5482.887679338844
17413. now you know she could've but she isn't that kind of	girl	639.8142341085143
17414. but now- well it would be a blessing i think	561.0079249664782
17415. linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed	bobbie's death could move her to feeling	1416.7448043381853
17416. what she felt was a bone-deep	loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome	ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into	high relief by his death	5916.895316062151
17417. she knew what people were thinking;	it was what she had been thinking herself	935.573850383247
17418. it was up to her to save	poor john dear john to undo the wrong she had done but she trembled	at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream	5159.744721524983
17419. there	was no one who would blame her or john; she could be sure of that	1256.2303894670767
17420. it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between	them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her	back to cleveland or anywhere	4973.902048305294
17421. and linda felt capable of capturing	the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie	had had none of their own	2338.9459876784294
17422. it would be good for them to have a mother	they need not be ashamed of	1866.386778726539
17423. linda would have to wait she knew	93.61623640479942
17424. but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty	years gone by	2135.3353585330747
17425. years of watching while poor john struggled without	the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get	ahead	2306.77532509003
17426. of course he had done wonders h	142.69526120013663
17427. alloy steels and	regular steels had different sales departments at smith + macisaacs	where john and bobbie both worked	984.908775639861
17428. bobbie had been head of the	alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular	branch	2573.0264941837477
17429. so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked	about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the	head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois it looked	like the perfect chance for bobbie	4043.6263638333758
17430. for linda knew how to help her	husband not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners	for reuben lovejoy	3039.481567839172
17431. she was almost sick when bobbie	came home with the news that poor john had won the job	1571.2023168987048
17432. what did	you do	4.461396799277116
17433. she asked bobbie	0.20041515
17434. you must have done something something	wrong	141.77375897942034
17435. lord knows i had everything set for you	167.7491322609065
17436. bobbie	said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and	linda got angry at him	1412.455644786532
17437. they had their first real fight and bobbie	went off to get drunk	787.9440494492798
17438. linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland	into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened	2357.800207998284
17439. he	was a director of s + m and must have been in on the decision	639.0298598206093
17440. but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie	had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in	a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand	5777.086653654631
17441. he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where	bobbie and john were weighed one against the other	1725.550023620946
17442. i'm	behind john cooper mr lovejoy said finally	248.44146203535175
17443. i think we're	agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look	at the thing in terms of incentive	2456.133906985927
17444. now i believe poor	john'll work just a little harder	564.1121878653591
17445. with that wife of his i think	he feels every chance he gets is his big chance	1412.5887494518317
17446. bobbie with linda	behind him will have plenty of other opportunities	750.0245726258704
17447. and also the	money can't mean as much to bobbie	373.6115101499462
17448. bobbie will take the	job as his just reward and work hard at it; poor john will take	it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting	up nights worrying about us	5627.7351928133885
17449. most of the directors nodded	14.849082695696527
17450. uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too	248.95647002835068
17451. after the surprise was over linda was almost as pleased as anyone	with john's good luck though she agreed with bobbie's decision	some months later to move to funk furnaces	3209.5948546362783
17452. the job at funk wasn't	particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to	john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a	large degree by various branches of linda's family	5768.944423214584
17453. poor john's	rise continued to be meteoric	93.47561375000099
17454. when he was made a vice president	only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran	his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business	leaders of the future	5829.359351406543
17455. she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night	642.673429586437
17456. shirley	appreciated the chance to make some money	249.03972359757148
17457. such a nice little thing-	lives right in the building	374.7592434582395
17458. that's swell i	said sweetly	22.340155666437333
17459. i could get along without that three dollars	165.75581366164982
17460. in some	ways it was worth being out the money- just knowing i was no longer	obligated to nadine!   it was past midnight and we were in	bed when the phone rang	5142.356383429498
17461. i stumbled through the hall wondering who would	be calling at this hour	787.3406280353975
17462. i answered to find nadine at the other	end	392.44210801056585
17463. you scared me half to death i said shakily	259.6281825712862
17464. what's	wrong	0.30041514999999996
17465. janice nobody answers at the apartment!	her voice came shrill	374.55379991189767
17466. i'm absolutely frantic! that stupid girl	might have gone off and left francie!   oh she wouldn't	do that i said	2826.1671527232493
17467. she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't	hear the phone	264.09452407108444
17468. but if you're worried you can go home and check-	i can't leave the party! we're at ken thom's	apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat!	old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply can't	afford to get ken mad at us-   i was all set for what	came next	7929.336388793748
17469. janice could you possibly go over and make sure everything's	all right	644.7568823768108
17470. i'll call you there in ten minutes-	i can't make it in ten minutes- wondering as i said it	why i should make it at all	4047.790513722232
17471. why should i go over at midnight to	check on francie when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party	2025.50729195351
17472. fifteen minutes then! please janice	22.151647106191046
17473. i'll	be glad to pay you-   so sure that money could do anything!	all right i said	1415.163485272285
17474. not for the dollar or so	nadine would give me	567.8924355254102
17475. but because there was the chance that something	had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didn't go over who would	2185.0273631206956
17476. chris was sound asleep and i didn't see any	sense in waking him	1185.8216096074098
17477. i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the	table telling him what had happened	1421.133225609551
17478. i drove off through the cool	darkness to nadine's apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds	a young girl opened the door	3918.297723344491
17479. her face was flushed from sleep	44.19191521161837
17480. it's	all right i said as she started to look scared	753.4880532110012
17481. mrs	roberts had called and couldn't wake you	167.39345704940408
17482. i just came over to	make sure everything was all right	746.9966416543072
17483. i'm- hard to wake	up she faltered	94.08663569778147
17484. she didn't look over thirteen	22.424657866493405
17485. and nadine	insisted that her sitters be reliable! i have to get up early	for church tomorrow she went on	1871.0917917949816
17486. i didn't know it was going	to be this late!   the phone started ringing	1407.9909613226523
17487. that's	mrs roberts again i said	43.36192034352153
17488. i crossed	the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone	967.0045447870021
17489. i told	nadine everything was fine and that i'd be getting on home	781.4301905121731
17490. janice would you mind staying	22.508627163320014
17491. there was a ragged edge	to her voice now as if she'd been crying	944.2557883286361
17492. wally's drunk-	i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i don't	want shirley to see him like this	3685.1824364243503
17493. you know how gossip of that sort	spreads through an apartment building-   not a word of thanks	for what i'd already done	2174.4357552117067
17494. the receiver clicked in my ear	64.76207989769934
17495. she	didn't even give me a chance to refuse	261.17804661994876
17496. well there wasn't any	law that said i had to stay! but then i looked at shirley and thought	that i might as well- the child needed her sleep and heaven	knew what kind of a mess it would be with wally coming home drunk	6908.695094434914
17497. so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she	scooted off to her own apartment	1884.2881865793413
17498. after i looked in at francie	i went into the living room and waited	1420.881908158716
17499. i must have dozed off	because i came to with a start at the sound of voices	1417.8353227146113
17500. nadine's shrill	with anger- wally's loud and thick- as i went to the door	i heard the clock strike two	2832.675026795887
17501. i opened the door and wally stumbled	in- fast- as if nadine had pushed him	1103.5433114104808
17502. i had always thought	she was so beautiful	248.9277462047336
17503. but now she looked ugly	14.924630061605018
17504. her skin was stretched	so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill	wally would have been dead	3055.013173548461
17505. pack your clothes she hissed	14.94354432015856
17506. pack- and get out!   you're crazy wally said	thickly	390.08675989376945
17507. he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on	it and was instantly asleep	1267.0295164310605
17508. nadine strode over to him and her pointed	nails raked across his face	1174.9897478664454
17509. i grabbed her arm and she turned on	me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and	she was crazy	2594.7497392800756
17510. you stay out of this she spat at me	388.63978027060716
17511. he's ruined us- do you hear me- he's ruined us! he insulted	ken thom! her eyes were wild	1565.370012850357
17512. he told ken to his face	that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman! and the other	people there were listening! we're ruined and he's going to	get out if i have to throw him down the stairs-	you'd	better simmer down i said nervously	7209.034664735242
17513. in the state she was in she could actually kill him! now	you just take it easy and i'll make you some tea-   tea	nadine screeched	2743.8529012783674
17514. how can you be so damn stupid	140.65691093579255
17515. wally's lost his job! ken will never forgive him- never! and	we	don't have any money- we don't have a dime! all we own is francie's	bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe	on them	4040.7499444582654
17516. and we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house	like yours- and all because of that-   i clamped my hand	over her mouth to stop the stream of filth	5289.441117254697
17517. stop that! you'll	wake up the whole building	166.95288258341878
17518. wally can't go any place at this hour-	well then i'll get out- but she looked	uncertain	2108.2857450797137
17519. she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't	go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning	2027.8572094320855
17520. you	go to bed i said curtly	139.75001055200354
17521. in the morning you and wally can talk	things out-   she collapsed against me as if everything	inside her snapped	1877.967718151863
17522. i got her into bed and sat with her until she had	sobbed herself out	1638.5145270624548
17523. it was three o'clock before i figured it was	all right to go	786.5474600686172
17524. i left her a limp bundle of self-pity shivering	with terror because her bubble had burst around her	2348.51135719839
17525. wally was snoring	on the davenport	43.9747528803582
17526. i had done all i could	65.27107715538979
17527. i had done all i was going	to do	260.65784903149813
17528. whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine	955.1917929944308
17529. i drove home found chris still asleep	94.08048789248144
17530. i snuggled up close to him-	loving him- thankful for a man like him	1423.659221431456
17531. i kept on being thankful	14.944862828220135
17532. in the afternoon nadine and	wally came over with francie	567.0523316253947
17533. wally sat in our big chair his hands	between his knees looking ready to cry	1093.3690916653572
17534. i'd had all this trouble	with the old man that's why i drank so much	1642.4320684400232
17535. i- got fired	yesterday for not attending to business-   old mr thom	himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job wally	confessed and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits	waiting to be repaired	4207.998029979653
17536. seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair	business of his own going on the side	2375.7481068103652
17537. mr thom had gotten wally	on the phone and fired him	504.64443883447467
17538. i thought i'd smooth things over	through ken wally said miserably	748.2349156287567
17539. but ken got coy and wouldn't	make any promises	261.26586317798933
17540. and i was plastered and i blew my stack-	and told him right to his face he'd never slept with	a woman! i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there	5155.26365645178
17541. but she was beyond caring what she said	165.89354971207314
17542. things may	smooth over yet chris said his nice lean face grave with honest	concern	1655.2736073372234
17543. but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were	getting just what they deserved	1093.3958345024716
17544. now maybe they'd realize that life	can be tough	391.0664568401579
17545. when a bubble breaks there's nothing	43.342687712729166
17546. little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy	unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived	2605.828105951909
17547. they had not only	spent every cent- they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything	they owned	1873.9896768109816
17548. on top of everything else they were two months	behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written	notice that he was fired they were evicted	4441.9189279263655
17549. worst of all	wally had no training for any kind of work	640.7689603045537
17550. he had fallen into a soft	job and now the job was gone and he was stranded	2129.648070978161
17551. i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide	them over	1251.001263535156
17552. i said i wished we were too	140.43413079540312
17553. it was easy enough	to say it because of course we couldn't spare a cent	1093.030604219611
17554. but chris	brightened up like a candle	141.86702397859295
17555. i'm glad you feel that way honey	93.62259581671906
17556. there is one big way we can help them	390.7600598622521
17557. we can let them move in	with us-   something i had simply never thought of	1091.0691746968319
17558. something	so incredible-   i just stared at him	251.8175501916162
17559. it was incredible-	he gave me an embarrassed pleading look	372.8889871418505
17560. i know we'd be	pretty crowded	65.21028271869446
17561. but it would only be for a couple of weeks- until they	get straightened out	1084.644431040321
17562. straightened out- they'd had	years of making all that money! i won't do it i said flatly	2122.263728087625
17563. nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this!	well now she can sleep in the street for all i care!	that isn't like you janice chris said uncomfortably	3560.95581712717
17564. then i felt uncomfortable too	22.20561737598664
17565. i didn't want to be like that mean	and bitter	374.054693059279
17566. but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled	snobs who had looked down their noses at us	3033.4085093782933
17567. but in	the end we did	43.024417933728486
17568. it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do	754.3246330537183
17569. the finance company took all their furniture- and they didn't	have a cent to their name	1255.2342523401117
17570. to my way of	thinking he was scared sick	391.8832173887853
17571. his luck had failed him and it was easier	to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world	2171.8849828670463
17572. chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes	and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special	3726.6120545467156
17573. at least	we'll eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away	943.3671101584216
17574. while i worked nadine sat and cried	141.99131248736106
17575. when she wasn't crying she	was in our bedroom fighting with wally	640.6965621109773
17576. virus infection nothing	she'd	scream at him	140.9827768288574
17577. you're too lazy to go out and look for	another job	500.53605214373056
17578. you're just a no-good bum!   it was a mess	all right	754.4420046666738
17579. but it couldn't go on forever- a couple of weeks	chris had said	789.44252908292
17580. i figured i could stand practically anything for a	couple of weeks	958.4125229686631
17581. but the two weeks dragged into three and they	were still with us	778.7472081219391
17582. nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten	wally out of bed	557.3376980961488
17583. he set out every morning looking for work and come	home around noon full of alibis and excuses	1573.630834950853
17584. wendell thom had black-balled	him	22.355793291413
17585. nobody would even take his application	43.21357578809309
17586. you	can get something nadine would snap	141.7231860881643
17587. you can get a job working	in a grocery store if nothing else	787.8185174658971
17588. the high school	kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice	1876.6175641662135
17589. those damn punks- taking work away from men who need it	503.06988318670017
17590. by fall they'll be back in school i'd say	trying to sound encouraging	1180.147770014247
17591. but this was only the middle of july h	263.44722911795697
17592. and i couldn't take six more weeks of this	388.0996593037986
17593. i mentioned	it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for	a breath of fresh air	1892.2406686296283
17594. i don't really believe in intuition	65.08988619204396
17595. but i swear to	you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a	bad day	2174.9419120819175
17596. part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice	as long to get to the hospital	2816.2641591797264
17597. part of it was being so tired- i'd	not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well	that kept me up late	2850.073795296853
17598. but the rest of it the main part wasn't	based on logic at all	1401.1070173207183
17599. it was just going to be one of those days	371.9715718882
17600. for the thousandth time i wished i'd chosen some nice nine-to-five	five-days-a-week profession	1184.7364244693647
17601. and for the thousandth time i	answered myself	167.44846216189984
17602. i hadn't chosen medicine- it had chosen me	250.71362359100303
17603. actually i shouldn't complain i told myself in the shaving	mirror	503.82498058560986
17604. i had a lot to be thankful for	249.23415963091284
17605. a profession that brought	me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at	1257.8941868071665
17606. maybe i	didn't see as much of gladdy as i'd like but how much worse it	would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice	went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home	6186.008512294233
17607. at least	we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after	us- no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was	2854.00970335715
17608. i	was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it	746.6076317965496
17609. especially in the	way gladdy had turned out	167.28386311216985
17610. growing up without a mother from the time	she was three- it wasn't a good thing for a child even knowing	the kind of mother alice had been	4477.140893019233
17611. but i mustn't start on alice	43.55759995992002
17612. she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look	at	1882.0444256003855
17613. if she'd kept on as she'd been going the story i'd told	gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhow h   as usual	gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table	3546.574672771324
17614. her	first class wasn't until ten but she always got up to have breakfast	with me	1872.1886892124894
17615. it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all	on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too	2857.659501997044
17616. oh i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her	decision	1406.3384871414453
17617. i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising	intern at fairview had something to do with it too	2034.8816856077399
17618. she'd	been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about	their date lightened my mood a little	2829.656242669807
17619. but once i was alone again	driving	to the hospital the heaviness returned	785.5918371796129
17620. if she and pete were	really getting serious i'd have to do some hard thinking	1637.0599100423
17621. should	i tell him the truth about alice	168.01836902207646
17622. did he have a right to know the	secret i'd kept from gladdy all these years	1898.188531598585
17623. the boys were	already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview	1253.9687151945766
17624. two interns and dick ishii the other resident	250.41523013106388
17625. i'm chief	of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with	me taking the boys on the rounds	2045.9419146284786
17626. pete was down on seven dick	told me and he'd meet us there	1173.1523376072296
17627. there wasn't anything of	special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been	1256.2192178663086
17628. pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven-	he'd had a case of post-operative shock but it was all taken care	of now	4633.265315430872
17629. seven is a women's floor and as it happened not very busy	right then	945.2125992096617
17630. when we'd finished our regular rounds pete pointed	me toward the small ward at the end of the floor	2579.7349326239882
17631. got a new	one in last night he said	262.5164334090125
17632. i haven't seen her yet but i	hear she's a lulu!   i wasn't surprised	1409.1823607915135
17633. the ward was	a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics	791.5866564982099
17634. we didn't	get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights	953.5285188722673
17635. it was	thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular	charity ward	1247.952863401323
17636. the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling	of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed	3049.3511228542197
17637. they'd cleaned	her up some of course and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk	1102.068303080918
17638. but there was something about her- and i felt my lips forming	a name	1409.3487814635168
17639. alice h but this woman's name was rose bancroft!	i looked at the chart for reassurance	1253.7292512199997
17640. yes rose bancroft	diagnosis: acute alcoholism	64.72352202460218
17641. she looked about sixty though i recalled	that the chart gave her age as forty-four	1100.567722487402
17642. an ugly scar disfigured	the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale	network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry	3471.9119044660574
17643. her coarse hair	was two-colored- bleached blonde and its real dirty gray	639.5440721552062
17644. oh could it be	4.416534246258648
17645. no no h it was an unfortunate resemblance	that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my	disquiet out of my mind	2964.852634952372
17646. in a low voice dick filled us in	h	she'd been picked up downtown passed out	in the doorway	2582.570201474173
17647. although quiet when they brought her in she'd suddenly	turned violent and had to be knocked out	1412.8523630026968
17648. it was the old story	22.258006598198868
17649. we'd keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her	1107.4128791956186
17650. but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life	she'd left	1659.6480803461832
17651. turning toward the patient again i- i can't	describe what happened to me then except to say that i felt sick	2015.5836134257013
17652. i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to	speak	1873.8289612068977
17653. now miss- or is it mrs bancroft	93.62348078485867
17654. i never	liked going straight into an examination with patients- it relaxes	them i've always thought to chat first	2588.6358823486235
17655. this was one time i'd	have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong	1248.9429832288156
17656. hey! her voice was flat and dull	139.809326240816
17657. but those penetrating eyes-	i had to turn my head away	502.9613679781787
17658. it was then that i saw what the drawn-back	covers revealed	751.5889733782474
17659. there were bloodspots on the sheet	43.79517764693604
17660. your period	0.30041514999999996
17661. she	shook	her head	2.9697231753747992
17662. i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly	no emotion in her voice	1878.4729463034691
17663. have you spoken to a doctor	about it	166.65550796835788
17664. once again there was a negative shake	141.38560791745007
17665. i told	miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining	table	1256.2211267733442
17666. better do a papanicolaou i told pete	139.35133639906076
17667. it was only a	few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for	a vaginal but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination	2864.479958603248
17668. pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab	with a request for the test	3275.915927618452
17669. that done i told miss groggins to	take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind	2015.3654329489232
17670. i was busy the rest of the day	251.04449435617457
17671. late in the afternoon i was up on	seven again	372.1744336961698
17672. one of my private patients was being admitted and i went	in to see her settled	1878.822463499148
17673. on my way to the elevator i ran into pete	376.73883879736917
17674. i've got the results on the bancroft smear test he said	752.742681603783
17675. there's something there all right	14.799367857029358
17676. do you want to talk to her doctor	247.62048290178762
17677. well- i didn't-	i didn't ever want to see that woman again	635.5063550286271
17678. but that was	ridiculous of course	65.44787532831087
17679. we'll do a d and c and	get her permission for a hysterectomy	787.9234569317179
17680. maybe it's nothing maybe	it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances	1179.457923632022
17681. if you can keep her here that long pete said wryly	499.4112304689441
17682. groggins	tells me she's started badgering already wants to get out	743.4852027776956
17683. wants to get to her booze i guess	166.68184261024805
17684. well better see what i can do	141.45716916167962
17685. we'd been standing	right outside miss bancroft's door and as i went to turn the	knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar	3080.6419031307723
17686. but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in	low tones	1874.7741871714456
17687. her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though	and once again i felt an inward shiver	1577.3580057510985
17688. i sure can't complain	about the service in this place she said	963.2248144402444
17689. i just got through seeing	one of you guys	261.9990307579284
17690. what do you want	4.392389377987842
17691. there was something	almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it	638.8507362165989
17692. i've	just been talking to dr michelson i said	390.2782441989385
17693. we'd like	you to have a dilatation and curettage	261.5129768073669
17694. that's quite minor nothing	to worry about	140.40450971108632
17695. but we would like your permission to do- that is	to go further if it proves necessary	1422.509111815179
17696. suppose you let me explain	22.14977817677058
17697. actually i rather	doubt that we'll have to do this	371.5809624632858
17698. even if we do you'll be out	of here in a week probably	1179.5213211039477
17699. i was sure that was the difficulty-	she just didn't want to stay here where she couldn't get	to the liquor	2027.276589694225
17700. i looked at her in amazement	64.68882914115059
17701. i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before of course but	never one who didn't show in one way or another the reason why	2320.0358085022763
17702. mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't tremble and	her hands were still on the coverlet	2347.774433372156
17703. will you tell me why	14.687485246950889
17704. i asked	0.30041514999999996
17705. she smiled a smile without humor	43.73777072429484
17706. you shouldn't	tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door	she said	1170.0309350768846
17707. i've got cancer haven't i	14.91103979142558
17708. she went on disregarding	my protests	65.41708870399505
17709. i'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs	373.3972877985889
17710. let your pupils learn on someone else doctor	250.70856986587455
17711. just let me die in	peace	43.39660574274803
17712. i stared at her almost speechless	64.48820714518189
17713. her little	speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought	she was	1407.7249871148115
17714. even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone	566.2418902141959
17715. this	was someone who'd come down in the world i thought	504.7274428126584
17716. a long	long way down	22.224626381013252
17717. again there was something familiar about her something	h   you haven't got cancer i said as strongly	as i could	1896.0129835858083
17718. i don't know what you heard that would make you	think so but i assure you i don't even know myself so how can	you be so sure	4505.561290721832
17719. and even if-   don't give me a lot	of talk joe	499.8574067481294
17720. she could have found out	my first name of course- that wouldn't be difficult	1404.9960555155037
17721. but there	was that something some echo in the way she spoke h   she was	watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips	2589.3064347769587
17722. surprised	baby	0.30041514999999996
17723. guess i've changed haven't i	14.91103979142558
17724. but you haven't	changed much joe	64.73301665523965
17725. i knew then knew with a heart-stopping	shock	167.57551780669368
17726. alice- i stammered through dry lips	65.12988037180409
17727. alice	for goodness sake-   alice she echoed mockingly	167.13226445998484
17728. what's	the matter joe you scared of me	249.61342619067705
17729. think i'm going	to make you introduce a drunk as your wife	646.4030519929521
17730. well don't worry	0.30041514999999996
17731. just	let me outta here-   but why did you come back	501.76990356541864
17732. i'd found my voice	4.452459229223161
17733. where have you been all these years	94.40656010424755
17734. she shrugged	0.30041514999999996
17735. as for coming back here-	well i'll tell you the truth i didn't even know where i was when	i came to	2183.571672054657
17736. the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego-	the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout	made me shudder	3882.801179017801
17737. and this was gladdy's mother!   i	never asked you for any favors joe she went on but i'm	asking one now	2027.5662971840047
17738. let me outta here! you doctors are all alike-	all you want is to cut up people and what's the good	3044.5298006084367
17739. no i want	out joe!   i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before	me	1254.519625461735
17740. let her out let her out- that would be the solution wouldn't	it	1180.1900824798286
17741. what she'd said was true- in all these years she'd	never asked for anything from me	1256.1025955525997
17742. if i let her go she'd disappear	once more	393.8659435592178
17743. and gladdy would be safe!	i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea	1255.1991231410145
17744. her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's;	the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one-	the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me	but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic	6563.211122695853
17745. yielding-mediterranean-woman-flesh-of-water	she soothed me and drew me deeper into her	373.0089743064158
17746. i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under 230 feet	getting drunker happier and more contented by the second	3033.938070344494
17747. the reasons	for this dive seemed foolish now	166.26404494037936
17748. only the dive itself had any meaning	140.94557532756195
17749. the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove	the mouthpiece	and suck in the sweet water	1582.1974500290596
17750. perhaps if i took off the	aqua-lung i could swim better love my woman better	1655.1794767465585
17751. i chuckled aloud	and the mouthpiece fell out	166.87500036589853
17752. while a hazy part of my mind	concentrated on swimming down a clear part sorted over recent events	among them my only positive act in a long time	4473.222122704052
17753. it was when i packed	up what duds i had and went to paris	939.3996567311451
17754. it was no vacation just me	getting out after a bellyfull	753.0214675872764
17755. i knew it wouldn't be the same	94.08868740502146
17756. wild	kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind	1645.2418672368742
17757. once before i had been to paris long before i married valery	641.18043146031
17758. that first time was good and it stuck with me	556.8371067983082
17759. i was twenty-one back	then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of	rhine-main	1735.1299981382545
17760. it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain	and i was a little high on the good taste of life	3472.8639952579374
17761. i had a pocketful	of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane	would be grounded all night	2316.448750718592
17762. in less than an hour i had gotten a	hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh	uniform	3501.3953688616807
17763. i felt like a hun in rome	93.75762041810252
17764. all the women were	beautiful	and the men were equal to them; everything was glamorous to	my dazzled eyes	2576.9787840681247
17765. there were some sweet machines other than women:	an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow	a type 540-k mercedes and lots more	3002.402257206307
17766. there was the arc	de triomphe and the tour d'eiffel- i was no yokel but i was	young and this was paris!   i had champagne at maxim's	then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre	6681.434184277432
17767. i met claire which was better	43.2777744373622
17768. she was	eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing	it down with red wine	2841.0700635424023
17769. i didn't know a human could feed	so fast and still be beautiful	786.8281259139544
17770. she was blonde and young and nice	and round in a tight white dress	1423.9382107660733
17771. maybe her ravenous eating wasn't	grotesque because she was so positive about it	791.141968294867
17772. when she had	drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly	to my table and said:   handsome soldier i have assuaged	one hunger with food	4822.101832803978
17773. i feel another of terrible urgency	43.567111957299076
17774. is your evening	free	4.459107360971508
17775. madame i said with noblesse oblige because	of the handsome- yeah	503.25136255148584
17776. and so off we went	to her apartment	248.78218209069047
17777. she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl	262.8458866050939
17778. toward	the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about	her way of eating bread and cheese	2595.3773880038184
17779. now it was nine years later	and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned	1090.1231624308396
17780. i got	there on a saturday evening	141.3637940079162
17781. i made the mistake of going to the jour	et nuit	496.54533781458395
17782. the place was busy but i didn't feel like a hun	756.9785415105403
17783. i	sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up	638.5681182530942
17784. i had part of a	bottle of french beer called panther pils then switched	to tuborg	1885.161875469852
17785. after a few hours life hadn't showed and i was crocked	502.59510459224566
17786. i went to my hotel and slept	140.96556846717286
17787. the next morning a little cognac	made me feel better- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning	1885.75873563448
17788. so i drank more cognac	22.43591804591145
17789. all that day and monday i	drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space	1251.8454782405302
17790. i read the tropic	of capricorn and the tropic of cancer	747.364901380917
17791. that's what was on my mind	43.77433526867637
17792. i was turning over the idea of a good	debauchery when i dozed off	1413.7116387299886
17793. i felt better tuesday evening	when i woke up	261.80819021707487
17794. my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled	to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others	3684.2561651325814
17795. a good	binge has that kind of therapeutic value	260.2441749437015
17796. sometime earlier	the weather had turned cold and it was snowing	754.0688438746096
17797. i went out into it	14.844959938818263
17798. i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park	and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came	from the sky	5355.985434871138
17799. there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes	falling through the blue night	1099.915381719382
17800. i had on only a topcoat but i wasn't	cold	563.4241719694428
17801. pretty soon a woman came along	carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick	951.9695062979766
17802. she saw me and sat	down beside me three feet away	749.2216645600741
17803. suddenly i understood why she had	the umbrella	168.02088097736674
17804. it gave her poise and posture	65.23786341939501
17805. without it she would have	been drab and limp	263.40255974440834
17806. it gave her the right	to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle	2363.9154162306504
17807. i	couldn't imagine her without it	43.03702727507501
17808. i knew all about her	22.218905910770886
17809. she was another	human being and happened to be a hustler	501.15666007742277
17810. i didn't much care if	she were there or not	560.6377431495208
17811. after a while she said with sort of an	unuttered laugh you have snow in your hair and ears	1736.1524151843034
17812. hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak	one which said thanks baby but i'd rather be alone	2349.3620273252927
17813. she	was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy	788.4399475794249
17814. i'm not unhappy i lied staring at the snow	393.1947162276789
17815. she was	trying to make a hole in my armor and i didn't want it	1093.0449522606373
17816. is it a woman	4.436327595874313
17817. she asked gently	0.20041515
17818. she must have seen the ring	on my left hand	559.1461242133015
17819. well- women and unhappiness go together	i observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on	that	1419.0766725722174
17820. ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it	h   this took me so funny i had to look at her	3261.107027993723
17821. i felt my	frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have	helped	1418.4020510753433
17822. i even snorted a chuckle	22.40783366905042
17823. she smiled at me but it	was an awfully sad smile	501.4303479449265
17824. she was even more miserable than me	139.83278879128753
17825. her eyes	were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite	wisdom in them	1414.3746013776135
17826. now isn't it better to smile	65.04219922617374
17827. she asked	0.20041515
17828. because i liked this sad person so much i said will	you have a drink with me	2118.433039887542
17829. i could see the ancient cynicism	reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked	up with this same gambit	2602.5969115336875
17830. anyway i pulled a bottle of	remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her	2797.176681566322
17831. i could see she was shocked	43.502011709747926
17832. i'm sorry i haven't	got a glass i said	394.0932935949903
17833. non non she said taking the	bottle not for that be sorry	639.4562919055218
17834. she tilted up and drank	and then i drank	389.6296401425845
17835. it's really rotten to drink good cognac like	that but i hadn't cared before	938.5333073338394
17836. i wasn't going to lug around a	glass	250.41912329218061
17837. there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could	see her well	942.5560726627427
17838. no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or	even forty	963.288163689827
17839. somehow she was attractive	2.9613061562748264
17840. not	good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive	1178.1135324421214
17841. i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there	782.7065303087933
17842. we	finished the bottle- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier- not	speaking much to each other and we stayed sober	3471.384593657157
17843. i suppose	we were cold but we didn't feel it	370.88421890348786
17844. we seemed to be drowsing sadly	soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell	1883.138743211158
17845. then she said	allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word	1255.9056430786152
17846. i sensed no stranger in her	64.9530053715795
17847. we undressed and made love with	the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery	1108.372838405499
17848. i decided	thirty-five was the best estimate of her age	560.0288358432268
17849. she had a funny little	scar on her stomach on the left side	786.3062316755288
17850. i think we were very	tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to	see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime	had melted	5314.840777793335
17851. i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's	melancholy	372.43882372241944
17852. i was hungry as a wolf and	my body felt lean and vital	1187.5662555835345
17853. bon jour i said brightly	sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips	937.9390644126252
17854. she looked good with	her short tousled hair and no make-up	753.7443202033324
17855. maybe closer to thirty i	thought	43.356287274853415
17856. bon jour! she exclaimed smiling	22.0582673241962
17857. j'ai	faim! yeah but breakfast first	43.43400145150597
17858. with a laugh she	beat me to the bathroom	391.8516312238427
17859. i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush	for her	372.7417890737735
17860. she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe	1419.3374449421678
17861. i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a	waiter wheeled in breakfast	1414.7984052074478
17862. the toothbrush monsieur he	said presenting it	139.646706838105
17863. i gave it to the woman	43.564760863028575
17864. what is this	for	4.41207859582689
17865. she asked innocently	0.20041515
17866. why to brush your teeth	22.35804144207863
17867. but i already have! i used yours	93.51930602066099
17868. oh	0.30041514999999996
17869. i said with round eyes	14.914866250214988
17870. i wondered if i ought to go use the new	one myself	967.5542318850801
17871. but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell	live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away	1880.3369513769255
17872. the coffee	wasn't very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good	1648.4354411606716
17873. we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot	hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread	1879.979457339823
17874. as we ate we talked	22.162413596663505
17875. her name	was suzanne and mine stephen	94.77124005634653
17876. we sat back comfortably on	the bed with our last cups of coffee	1177.5656258591787
17877. you are very tactful	do you know stephen she remarked	378.54385564628376
17878. yes because you didn't run off to use that	new toothbrush	745.6069867743992
17879. i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror	502.7663116584971
17880. i didn't really use yours she went on	248.94080598177501
17881. i carry	one in my purse	43.00753387253154
17882. i know men never kiss les putains	142.43982495551012
17883. to	my immense relief she changed the subject in the next sentence:	shall we go to the louvre today	1730.4254871628723
17884. all right	0.30041514999999996
17885. i	said with enthusiasm at the idea	93.7028560898479
17886. i put	aside my empty cup	65.27039834179416
17887. she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and	drained her own	938.4847308425497
17888. what is this	from	4.462879935846325
17889. i asked touching the scar on her stomach	166.302092661058
17890. it was like a	long thin line drawn through a pink circle	963.0929365025198
17891. the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i	wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all	2183.840561201553
17892. she understood sex	anyway and played at it well	391.4481985828039
17893. we went to the louvre for a	few hours then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre	1411.1479882896801
17894. it was	a nice place not filled with smoke	394.5162061148441
17895. we had champagne and steamed mussels	43.942419161201215
17896. the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of	the bottle i had ordered	1655.1006990575268
17897. he must have thought i was a tourist	166.32436244836552
17898. i fixed him with a steely eye and said what's this for	959.9078970359927
17899. i didn't ask for a jeroboam of champagne	166.3571517216028
17900. i thought that	was pretty humorous but i didn't laugh	559.5235821630235
17901. two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield: she	put them in her bag	935.4614299044581
17902. she would not stop to read them in american	express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the	walls but pushed her way out into the street	4811.148292391389
17903. this was her first	day in rome and it was june	501.0427201094869
17904. an enormous sky of the most delicate	blue arched overhead	562.7949449561327
17905. in her mind's eye- her imagination responding	fully almost exhaustingly to these shores' peculiar powers	of stimulation- she saw the city as from above telescoped on its	great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress	there a pine and all around the low blue hills	4961.879676972186
17906. pictures in	old latin books returned to her: the appian way today the colosseum	the arch of constantine	2344.5450617919605
17907. she would see them looking just as	they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight	2182.3655530963506
17908. moreover nursing various stubblefields- her aunt then her mother	then her father- through their lengthy illnesses	theresa had had a chance	to read quite a lot	4080.636775719996
17909. england france germany switzerland and	italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the	prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion	by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes	4300.798279140587
17910. the very	night after her father's funeral she had thought though never admitted	to a soul: now i can go	2844.311811246609
17911. there's nothing to stop me now	43.321452378997364
17912. so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy	752.4384908607417
17913. in the street the traffic was really frightening	166.8401953125692
17914. cars taxis buses	and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length	of it or swerving perilously around a fountain	3280.560847433743
17915. shoals of tourists went	by her in national groups- english school girls in blue uniforms	german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking	in shop windows	2841.6224793954057
17916. glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor	staircase that opened to her left	1639.8539005263433
17917. something special was going on here just now- the annual display of	azalea plants	947.1528389176152
17918. she had heard about it the night before at her hotel	754.3810042762155
17919. it was not yet complete: workmen were unloading the potted plants	from	a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above	2462.520906114826
17920. the azaleas	were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight	in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to	the palest pink along with many white ones too	5805.972962502192
17921. marvelous thought	theresa climbing in her portly well-bred way for she was someone	who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to	notice everything	3094.5909268987707
17922. in rome all over europe she intended to move very	slowly indeed	960.1117700459079
17923. halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat	down	261.04368620689223
17924. other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters	and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass	or just enjoying the sun	4307.294997569691
17925. theresa sat with her letters in her lap	breathing mediterranean air	501.2364088788113
17926. the sun warmed her as it seemed to be	warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill	insides of churches	3477.5220550751933
17927. she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette	262.13199108216827
17928. content h excited; how could you be both at once	563.993297012955
17929. strange	but she was	2.941589659217128
17930. presently she picked up the first of the letters	393.16940217462445
17931. a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted	with anxiety and dismay	1406.2786621862751
17932. of course one of them would have	to go and do this! poor cousin elec she thought tears rising	to sting in the sun but why couldn't he have arranged to live	through the summer	5626.8867666555325
17933. and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway	498.24934952105696
17934. she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had	managed to find her	1410.14237688587
17935. her cousin emma carraway had written it in her	loose high old lady's script- t's carefully crossed but	l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope	3232.5689724732392
17936. cousin	emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy	on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama	and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday	card to her next-door neighbor	6554.07044997692
17937. somebody	had scrawled american express piazza di spagna	165.04639464135892
17938. across the	envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been	the	president of the republic or the pope	3714.012734752466
17939. inside were all the things	they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death	and	burial of cousin alexander carraway	2187.8710475044963
17940. cousin emma and cousin	elec brother and sister- unmarried devoted aging- had lived	next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until	the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago	5334.919154756413
17941. two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about	what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had	always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl	paper	knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised	she could have when he died	5374.384816762935
17942. i'm supposed to care as much now	as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh	2603.265078311888
17943. this letter	would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome italy on	it	1255.4561006404679
17944. she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope	and turned with relief to one from her brother george	2586.2969141105705
17945. but alas	george when he had written had only just returned from going	to tuxapoka to cousin elec's funeral	1733.2344754264486
17946. he was full of heavy family	reminiscence	140.0580966317036
17947. all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world	today	791.326424438487
17948. his own children had suffered from the weakening of those	values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for	his grandchildren he shuddered	to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them	at all	6552.915760997729
17949. a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived	had to be known at first hand h	1885.6318961546942
17950. poor george! the only	boy the family darling	252.52904947244897
17951. together with her mother both of them tense	with worry lest things should somehow go wrong	1269.1294140674115
17952. theresa had seen	him through the right college into the right fraternity and though	pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to	the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife	anne had not seemed to understand poor george	7217.527221616246
17953. could it just be	theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that	george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was	dull	3098.66278560855
17954. as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing	theresa could remember at the moment about him	was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night	about one o'clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had	been aroused to go next door at cousin emma's call- first papa	then mother then theresa and george	8158.445573899818
17955. there they all did their	uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot	1410.0257219573198
17956. he had	hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped	in his bathrobe on a footstool	2822.380278714217
17957. he held his long clenched foot	in both hands and this and his contorted face- he was trying heroically	not to cry out- made him look like a large skinny old monkey	3447.6094825100618
17958. they	all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn	as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma	running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming	into a white enamelled pan	6696.034486661583
17959. can you think of anything to do	93.74691436710627
17960. she kept repeating	0.30041514999999996
17961. i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps	up i'll just have to! can you think of anything to do	2180.5547482656193
17962. you might treat it like the hiccups said papa	391.32729615278083
17963. drop a cold	key down his back	94.63469970352092
17964. i just hope this happens to you someday	said cousin elec who was not at his best	2114.6183764122443
17965. poor cousin elec	george said	14.768399114663413
17966. he was younger than theresa: she remembered looking	down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was	dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused	5146.387254015652
17967. now here they both were still the same george	full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair	1562.0847862829316
17968. theresa shifted	to a new page	65.18222139223317
17969. of course	there are practical problems to be considered	260.88171637978337
17970. cousin emma is alone	in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it	1885.8565290483907
17971. robbie	and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them	and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here but	i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long	as our rosie is still in high school	4882.752840804033
17972. the other possibility is to	make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher	of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka	is populated with- miss edna whittaker for example	6435.693286405873
17973. but there	is more in this than meets the eye	375.4924277925547
17974. a new bathroom would certainly	have to be put in	561.5255804115667
17975. the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling	off h	508.0979706503484
17976. i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write	me about them	1891.5492376781563
17977. i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer	and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together	the best h	2877.031883182679
17978. i really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette	so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick	2586.169170846183
17979. i'll	start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps	504.36370428826604
17980. she got	up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past	her talking a group of young men	3268.009794188404
17981. they wore shoes with pointed toes	odd to american eyes and narrow trousers and their hair looked	unnaturally black and slick	2038.5858951667237
17982. yet here they were obviously thought to	be handsome and felt themselves to be so	1640.1251281270502
17983. just then a man approached	her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal	portraits	1566.056556902907
17984. no no! she said	4.41411768167019
17985. the	man did not wish to leave	92.90713215259022
17986. he knew how to spread himself against the	borders of the space that had to separate them	2120.0795788165588
17987. carrozza rides in	the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized h	643.1723158518155
17988. theresa turned	away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps	divided in two	2128.9923933237633
17989. there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant	section of banister while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed	american lady carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag	ascending the steps alone	3881.1999475316106
17990. was he ever successful theresa wondered	65.2705161085021
17991. the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation;	at last alarm	940.7966205235016
17992. she cast about as though looking for a policeman:	this really shouldn't be allowed! finally she scurried	away up the steps	3050.0825917963343
17993. theresa stubblefield still holding the	family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was	viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elec's	death and doing something about cousin emma	3757.9503788541515
17994. they were even	anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not	hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries	and come home in august to get cousin emma's house ready before the	teachers came to tuxapoka in september	6676.610399378927
17995. of course it wasn't anne	and george's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another	and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't	know what they would do without theresa	3424.9065463383254
17996. the trouble is theresa	thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to	matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist	3459.6586134946147
17997. they would	not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow	1090.1855311517932
17998. it	never registered with them that i had time to real all of balzac dickens	and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything	in the city library after mother's operation	5142.46082905982
17999. it would have been	exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes	of elsie dinsmore	1875.2020113313624
18000. she arranged the letters carefully one	on top of the other	756.5785792915158
18001. then with a motion so suddenly violent that she	amazed herself she tore them in two	1249.343223549206
18002. signora	0.30041514999999996
18003. she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea	pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could	begin arranging a new row of the display	3531.5028283928086
18004. mi diapiace	signora ma h insomma h	143.25338770985152
18005. oh h put it there!	she indicated a spot a little distance away	784.9197571174142
18006. i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield- that lucille	was a husband stealer	1644.5961908892791
18007. you can't keep that kind of information quiet	in a town of only 4000-plus	932.9155960624681
18008. and i've been told that just about	every town no matter what its size has its lucille warren	2359.579451555197
18009. just as it has its susan dolan though nobody'd ever bothered to	tell me that	1091.1178102598074
18010. they even talked about	lucille down at the young christians' league where i spent	a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work	for our foreign mission	5194.342606560202
18011. i never heard my folks talk about her though	261.35371697887643
18012. they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say	i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody	2588.084377350468
18013. even if they ever	did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn't	have dreamed of saying it in front of me	2587.3365784595353
18014. my folks and my faith	protected me from things like that	748.181613290791
18015. and so i was really upset	the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing	mrs warren	1872.3549546759132
18016. i asked him about it one night while we were sitting	in his truck	1411.206164327914
18017. i asked him if it was true	93.53576185478803
18018. he gave me a straight	honest answer	141.7451107834954
18019. look sue baby he'd said	14.758149345891766
18020. much as i	love you- well a guy's a guy and lucille's willing to-	to come across	2133.705063836387
18021. honest kitten that's all it is- i don't even	like lucille much	643.4252362282133
18022. i guess it was at that moment that i	realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren	3021.682768945714
18023. but	it didn't seem fair	14.73245078680986
18024. my love for johnnie was young and clean-	how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn't hesitate	to use her sex	3899.349323914671
18025. johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber	outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good	at anything in the carpentry line	2982.7421856288843
18026. it was a vivid sharp february	morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing	some stuff dad had ordered	3483.4249506417887
18027. i wasn't in the habit of batting	my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was	different	2315.7450544676744
18028. he wasn't only different- he was it	139.55245434827395
18029. he had an	easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids don't have but	that i had sometimes admired in other older men	2458.6459089425716
18030. his smile was quick	and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp	2124.9530642204622
18031. the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he	seemed interested in me too	1249.7514820207693
18032. i could hardly believe such	good luck was mine	390.87430130418113
18033. and now lucille warren had gotten a look	at him	377.29313550313105
18034. i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she	had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie	2592.282151775751
18035. i didn't	like it one bit	43.35885083049086
18036. but what could i do	22.384163062773787
18037. a man had to have his release-	at least that's what the boys used to say in high school- and	i wasn't providing it for johnnie	2734.931293281938
18038. she	wouldn't have even if he'd asked her	249.96675158503118
18039. but he wouldn't	ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit	to him against her will	2311.5372945639833
18040. and he wouldn't leave her either- he'd	told me that	552.2207932746607
18041. he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and	leave those helpless children without their daddy	1409.374286889511
18042. johnnie	loved me and wanted me	65.03124239198044
18043. but the only love i was giving him was the	pure kind	642.2911493298573
18044. it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time	752.6366694670062
18045. against my folks'	wishes we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck	1095.9415512510484
18046. the rides were tame enough- mostly we talked	250.07082968385717
18047. but by the time the	first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly	in love	1722.0577704920747
18048. yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck	a little	1409.9377126245854
18049. it's so crazy i told him once	93.67143405498607
18050. i always	imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like	that	1655.8301554899263
18051. and you	fall for a lumber jockey	94.54764797842337
18052. who drinks far too much	22.158449400719014
18053. and i was ticking off	the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys	whoever they are too much and who never goes to church	and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the	fold	4688.5547686995
18054. he examined his nails carefully	22.278546013654537
18055. i could walk	out the door	43.29868707369005
18056. and never	show my face or my truck around here again	756.4428295647475
18057. he still wasn't looking	at me	43.196244268596175
18058. or i could visit	lucille warren	65.54073296000706
18059. he shrugged noncommittally	0.20041515
18060. and	now he was seeing her	64.45225241119519
18061. he'd just admitted it to me	42.95736368301685
18062. i huddled	miserably beside him in the truck	251.60813040752396
18063. it was all my doing- his	seeing her	166.02167814825788
18064. johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was	the way i wanted to keep it	2584.0589405712644
18065. at first johnnie hadn't understood-	how could he not being a religious person like me	1098.8958464307605
18066. but then	he had said all right kid if that's how you want it that's	how it'll be	2361.147605389724
18067. but what had i done trying to keep us pure	374.6685244714174
18068. i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman	750.3390863944011
18069. i had just	the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil!   so	one week later i surrendered to him in the little motel on route	10	3107.2479344547387
18070. i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever	in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches	of lucille warren	4317.026841943156
18071. and though at the time i blushed	to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual	awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other	man had ever triggered	4038.9318695267743
18072. i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness	140.60099477213632
18073. astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the	darkness begging this man to make love to me	2022.2737207602145
18074. i will kitten!   outside in the	summertime	fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us	1883.3744464273088
18075. will	you always love me this way	93.42957780950067
18076. uh huh	0.30041514999999996
18077. and i snuggled closer to the man l loved	262.07271822377317
18078. it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced	1182.0772705440265
18079. i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage	but i had all the joy that goes with them	2176.690032985354
18080. johnnie	h	0.30041514999999996
18081. it can't be wrong can it	43.71553262650768
18082. not really	0.30041514999999996
18083. johnnie rose on one elbow	14.847881524758222
18084. it's never wrong	if love is real	142.46348246267206
18085. i took great comfort from his words	and smiled to myself in the darkness	947.5122642235744
18086. idiot's delight i later discovered	22.02514170469997
18087. i felt no conflict	between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing	938.4179286825974
18088. i had	always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times	i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a	maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about	6342.789781871647
18089. i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so	in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure	until i was married	3743.5275340938074
18090. i was practically a bride after all	141.59202052512381
18091. there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible	503.68440880036235
18092. of this i had no doubt	65.35891926722243
18093. wouldn't johnnie do practically anything	in the world to insure my happiness	644.0323899365397
18094. of course he would	4.457644726998419
18095. he'd	not only told me so he'd proved it	259.40165816839686
18096. it wasn't johnnie's fault	that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did	her best to make his life unbearable	3446.0453445509884
18097. just because he was honorable	enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent	man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share	of happiness too	3646.5072041372086
18098. and if i could contribute to that i'd do it	558.2185529960179
18099. no price is too high when true love is at stake	504.99871227209405
18100. and i had no doubts about how true this love was	751.9305836846412
18101. i'd	never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched	me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him	3099.8554090737102
18102. he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman	and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to	my own eighteen and a half	5002.779908298813
18103. what could a mere twelve years matter	94.47513789679827
18104. it wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between people	but a difference in maturity	2353.899205062521
18105. and hadn't i rescued him from	lucille warren	169.3079121893913
18106. she'd have gotten him if i hadn't stopped	her	390.6174614642306
18107. after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way	back	375.98865362272466
18108. but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing	me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we	shared	3904.64101817149
18109. it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might	bring	939.6474381319844
18110. always and always johnnie	4.448767293433898
18111. always	0.20041515
18112. convention time in boston	4.4298368710716165
18113. a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow	787.8259920031239
18114. from	the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming members	of the young christians' league and i'd been chosen to represent	our chapter	3882.7535359653266
18115. i had mixed emotions about going	43.41638278974463
18116. i'd been	seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want to leave	him for five whole days	2803.164884142092
18117. but i had looked forward so much to being	with this church group	788.6467624499176
18118. i hadn't been doing as much work as i used	to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder	than ever	4100.975066451245
18119. i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this	fine group	947.7243812340037
18120. so i went to boston	22.16132001888843
18121. the first meeting was	held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members	from all the other states	2457.82361054364
18122. my cousin alma at whose home i was	staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people	from rhode island	3492.96521471746
18123. one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow	named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing	blue eyes	2479.2176046555223
18124. he looked very different from johnnie- in fact he looked	sort of like me	1414.0046425587132
18125. i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said	so too	643.9204998223709
18126. after the meeting there was going to be a party at	someone's house	1172.732584796766
18127. i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion	of the meeting breaking up we were separated	1714.7663152049888
18128. outside the hall	i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a	hand on my elbow	2798.6763079177686
18129. hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald	said	166.04971474893804
18130. need a pumpkin to get to the party	247.69915527536554
18131. i couldn't	help laughing with him	43.44684991339507
18132. well i should find alma-	i began	141.2182335153018
18133. by the time we arrived the party was already going strong	496.1970887334469
18134. a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized	they were drinking	1631.9886899222004
18135. my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the	house so my first taste	of it had been- of course- with johnnie	2177.876892479405
18136. i hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning	746.013840770933
18137. but when	johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it	642.1125255613794
18138. of course	i enjoyed 'most anything if i did it with johnnie	958.5736498356773
18139. johnnie	h i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening	938.1066135172257
18140. but that was only natural i decided; surely he was still resting	snugly in my heart	1875.444992168735
18141. i don't see alma anywhere	i said	93.96475943521486
18142. c'mon let's find	out where they're keeping the glasses	391.5584653200202
18143. i-	i don't think so ronald	43.695038460667
18144. aw come	on	0.30041514999999996
18145. but	at least come along while i get lubricated	259.6451312584585
18146. strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure	all of them had come from the league meeting	2591.647477477768
18147. under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy	charm	with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs	1905.2470461020446
18148. today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on	the bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes hollow cheeks	hollow stomach	4272.283266496619
18149. a shot of orange juice would	make everything seem better	375.1275028386934
18150. he looked around his little eden:	bureau bed table chair two-burner stove	949.4365316043779
18151. you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow	at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting rain	that had sounded reasonable	2742.8810323417492
18152. in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic	arrangement	751.3076097693231
18153. share bath maybe- but share refrigerator	43.16466634494753
18154. she	had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and	not enough space in the units	2118.0979136293868
18155. and where was the thing	14.925847759594898
18156. he remembered	seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type	eatables	1881.809040190364
18157. ah yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside	on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number	four	2025.9139593161374
18158. it was still raining and mrs kirby's cottages	bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue	and green and magenta	3707.290953566626
18159. charlie downed his orange juice and one of	the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day	1896.071542756091
18160. this	vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had	prescribed it	1878.9332408491816
18161. take a full month the doctor had said	167.44925769954258
18162. lots	of sun lots of rest	64.68869486944999
18163. the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound	94.56312854081024
18164. this is a sleeping capsule	22.01148989977832
18165. the others will make you a little more	comfortable until you get it licked	941.3966849362317
18166. you young men get to be my age	you won't take flu so lightly	1412.46126108933
18167. charlie had accepted the	diagnosis without comment	94.23213720818703
18168. the doctor could call it anything from flu	to beriberi; but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew	too that there was no pill to cure it	4630.527155557007
18169. he had loved and lost vivian	wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and	had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which	was really piling it on	3949.5005131423663
18170. he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed	distrust of women	969.7888420893278
18171. once burned- scalded really because vivian	had given him every encouragement- forever shy	788.1123202414534
18172. from now on	his was going to be a man's world: the north woods duck blinds	at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries	3686.8138464880976
18173. meanwhile he	had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching	the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctor's prescription	for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery	3656.2925852694448
18174. in these damp circumstances	he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia	958.7840034925259
18175. he looked	up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted	slicker bearing down on him	1424.2246075375429
18176. three-day blow! she bellowed	triumphantly	22.284726074277142
18177. he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard	really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists	2176.981609954255
18178. fine day after tomorrow she added	65.10493642561164
18179. i hope so	he said	14.803317329407358
18180. thought i'd bake it out in	the sun	248.6565016904582
18181. you've got	a peaked look	14.81279687460399
18182. better get in out of the wet	140.02518829728336
18183. charlie forbore	to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less	than weatherproof	1084.9503576165448
18184. as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had	the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian	lost to him forever	4087.2253852849367
18185. he could imagine her at this minute honeymooning	in nassau with what's-his-name lounging on golden sands looking	forward to a life of unalloyed bliss	2455.852804806167
18186. all charlie could look forward	to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a	lonely old age- if he lived that long	4293.5640279109375
18187. he leafed through the	light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests: four separate	adventures of the bobbsey twins	and several agricultural	bulletins	on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle hideously	illustrated	3669.185238031597
18188. he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to	crash into the night table bruising his other shin	2831.2762608968524
18189. he took a yellow	pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something	alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy	2871.3335483566184
18190. his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had	dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator	door and climb in; but on further investigation the thing proved to	be a sweater of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets-	pale pale pink and according to the label size thirty-four	8292.507440089881
18191. he	thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation	for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread	and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind	4063.2896009908254
18192. next morning he found a note in the refrigerator	393.0992917269274
18193. would you	mind wrapping your onion	43.6119244792186
18194. said this note	0.30041514999999996
18195. the smell permeates	everything! everything being the sweater a lipstick case and	a squirt bottle of kissin' kare pink hand lotion	2028.1633712928226
18196. the note paper	was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine	1662.904235226983
18197. not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was	sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol	2029.321693434496
18198. he scrawled	sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his	better judgment added: don't you eat	2590.90239734517
18199. he didn't want	to encourage anything here; but on the other hand he didn't want	her swiping his salami	1718.9738169048246
18200. not onions came the answer the	following day	251.28842066879884
18201. must have really smelled up her	sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen	1731.131110163487
18202. but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic	or common sense	1639.7528882274462
18203. now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure	female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would	not be pink	2981.1482279653155
18204. they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic	and splashy like vivian herself	1653.342589492871
18205. pink vivian once had told	him	was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously	clinging to their infancy	2185.3867577141077
18206. why does this girl keep a sweater	in the refrigerator	563.8666385256726
18207. he mused aloud	0.20041515
18208. eh	0.30041514999999996
18209. it was	mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with	a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails	2033.8082229065694
18210. what's that	you say	4.431541409095776
18211. oh nothing	0.20041515
18212. just glad the rain's stopped	22.13765761131906
18213. just look at that sky	14.824665347105213
18214. be a scorcher by afternoon	22.0648787242772
18215. i've got this cold	2.9401808681351973
18216. she scrutinized him	0.30041514999999996
18217. you want	to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first sunny day	1252.9663719805167
18218. i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur	963.9620848462382
18219. that pale	kind's the worst	14.88317677055245
18220. that pale kind charlie thought	22.072093600303752
18221. but then neither was peaked	14.708017073473602
18222. he could	hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn	965.7537000942433
18223. i	spoke to the fellow next door too she might say	501.0620285891011
18224. surely there was a better word	65.67403591225376
18225. charlie looked	in the mirror	14.965131106844064
18226. frail	feeble- peaked	0.30041514999999996
18227. clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins	had done him no good	790.7183217908406
18228. the sun blazing hot as prophesied was	far from kind to mrs kirby's varicolored properties	1655.0366783833883
18229. when charlie	came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill the whole establishment	looked like a	floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at	regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators	3953.8707972945035
18230. this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued	retreat with cape roses maybe at the door	2837.9827269678617
18231. he could not imagine	a flower's being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and	the rest	1418.9086726348546
18232. the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in	its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes	3038.2664210003923
18233. no wonder	she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes	503.32257246848
18234. he got a	red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his	salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest	on the wrapping	5178.061760497797
18235. it gave him a good feeling	43.707745222948624
18236. thanks	was her answer the next day	140.4385861772791
18237. the note was propped against his	pill bottles and bore a postscript: you're not at all well are	you	1730.5504695987725
18238. i've got this cold he wrote	65.23604050301643
18239. not that it	was any of her business	165.43937550801428
18240. it's none of my business said	the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey	in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninety-six	5159.801987180379
18241. i mean	she's still living and she's ninety-six	167.98957363079109
18242. why don't you try that	21.989806076063044
18243. i don't have a lemon	14.871739967532733
18244. he had to write very small	to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper	2118.6567343620623
18245. by the next	morning she had turned the paper over	379.7893086219857
18246. she didn't sound like a pale girl	142.72933054452415
18247. she	sounded a little like a redhead	94.6659892636736
18248. but then redheads are often pale	65.47604053883016
18249. he stuck his head in mrs kirby's little rental office	376.0645457912752
18250. i guess that redhead next to me took your advice	555.7588793722117
18251. i haven't seen	her on the beach	94.08579777935566
18252. you won't if you're looking for	a redhead	251.04363077051448
18253. he spent that afternoon	on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing	suit	1583.0318769805328
18254. there were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired	girls in red or black or green bathing suits	2355.3798057731465
18255. there were a sprinkling	of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits	942.3123315079389
18256. up on	a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before	an easel and absorbed in her painting	3701.4570685027
18257. he paid little attention to her	because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one	of those bulky turtle-neck sweaters	2320.786509920613
18258. on the beach there were pale girls	and not-so-pale girls	561.9618837470829
18259. and he saw them all as he walked up and down	504.02735710796213
18260. at two that morning he was still walking- up and down	peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach	3700.6722261147406
18261. finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand	lotion and left a note	1096.134050830677
18262. i've got this sunburn said the note	and i used some of your hand lotion	1645.4309611761796
18263. of course i don't mind she answered	94.35266286049651
18264. you're	having a miserable time aren't you	141.001500310728
18265. use all the lotion you want	and for goodness' sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days	2019.4246810796317
18266. this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided	393.1445280962895
18267. sympathy	is a fine quality in a woman	166.78366466787827
18268. now vivian for instance was not	too long on sympathy	561.3390539770481
18269. she felt and said that sympathy only made people	feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world and you had to	be tough to hold your own	3002.0498087536434
18270. he didn't know what was so tough about	vivian's world slopping around nassau with what's-his-name	1648.84765547728
18271. suppose	what's-his-name got a sunburn	14.994287090392557
18272. charlie couldn't see vivian	offering any hand lotion	247.76811024490235
18273. she might peel him once the worst of the	agony was over	641.7513043846432
18274. charlie spent the next two days in his pajama	bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous	quantities of the hand lotion	4271.02668997663
18275. correspondence passed back	and forth	14.886930136382166
18276. how's your sunburn now	4.439704874821324
18277. the only thing this	lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if you're	so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it	3213.100905601994
18278. i'm	not that anxious but maybe that's why you're so fair	753.0565786731894
18279. that mrs kirby! i'll bet she told you i was puny too	638.5660549954187
18280. how's your cold	0.30041514999999996
18281. broiled out	0.20041515
18282. she didn't say	you were puny	65.03861791564799
18283. are you	0.20041515
18284. what's puny	0.30041514999999996
18285. puny goes	with pale and peaked	43.54108677300353
18286. do you have anything to read while you're shut	up	555.7350988062738
18287. there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness	and a book called 'tom swift and his speedy canoe'; but the	picture of tom swift is pretty sinister	3104.519751724557
18288. there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot	1652.3456548027123
18289. the	new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that	took a hop	1252.8962117438484
18290. for a few innings the anniston team couldn't figure him	out	751.439090054732
18291. then in the fifth anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve	and smacked the ball into left center field	1742.4780863090868
18292. eddie lee riverside's	redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled	past him	1651.6975364990856
18293. phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the	relay	790.7970357244478
18294. eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to	phil	1408.0684368859047

18297. mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag	647.5059841428131
18298. but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late	560.9067813022613
18299. he came into	the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in	his face	1730.5298678268816
18300. you bastard! the anniston catcher screamed	65.18944427113098
18301. he	jumped to his feet and started to throw punches	373.6845898884247
18302. mike deegan tossed	his glove away and began to swing at the catcher	1187.3271619222512
18303. this brought in everybody	from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the	uproar	1422.309169635437
18304. the fighters were separated in a few minutes	249.2883807214615
18305. but mike deegan was boiling mad now	94.23647548215608
18306. when the inning	was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout	1896.4217917106496

18310. keep your eyes open sonny! mike	yelled to the catcher	563.7663562062838
18311. the anniston	catcher did not reply with words	167.11544762093885
18312. he simply turned to mike and smiled	140.71749735798562
18313. this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said: i'll	get that little bastard	1085.6397342680052
18314. so help me god i'll get him	140.5815673527344
18315. phil rossoff said: why don't you leave him alone	262.05037387512647
18316. mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said	249.10895680110457
18317. he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan	was always looking for trouble	781.642052680105
18318. maybe the answer was in his eyes	140.4369630722588
18319. when	deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips	500.60386933088984

18405. you don't belong	in professional baseball	43.54094579612506

18407. is this because of what happened out there	164.4473583852868
18408. no	eddie said	0.30041514999999996

18417. phil shook his head and eddie frowned	94.5447670910531
18418. suddenly his voice grew hard	22.014586052686358
18419. what the hell do you think baseball	is	169.1574195093282
18420. you're not in the big leagues but if you can't give	and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there	4122.838332782188
18421. phil started to say something but eddie cut him short	373.85223917400174
18422. now don't tell me what a good ball player you are	750.3437916293683
18423. i know you've	got talent	14.950623267564685
18424. but what you haven't got is the heart to back up	that talent with	1415.4734503550621
18425. you just haven't got the heart	for pro-ball and that's it	503.76927799664907
18426. dazed phil said: i	don't get it	139.44698203440979
18427. my batting average h   eddie stood up abruptly	then sat down just as abruptly	944.3982098228747
18428. what difference does your	batting average make	139.2026440991515
18429. or your fielding average	2.9247796915022364
18430. or even the way you	run bases	141.16473385268336
18431. i tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win-	you won't do it	1256.0651727512184
18432. that's what i mean by no heart for the	game	560.2363435737353
18433. deegan had no business ramming into that	kid out there	372.345521666693
18434. he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out	of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on	3864.60855148304
18435. what the hell do you think baseball is	169.1574195093282
18436. a sport	0.30041514999999996
18437. it's a way of	life goddamit! and you've got	to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody	who want to take your way of life away from you!   he's	wrong! phil thought	3419.224912911099
18438. there were	other clubs in this league	140.02444281299952
18439. he was a little pale	and shaky	94.29924402113508
18440. his lips felt glued together	21.997319964979543
18441. i think you're	wrong eddie he said finally	167.22798041803483
18442. you'll	get your pay in the morning	140.90396929924935
18443. phil turned and left	the room hearing eddie say: someday you'll see i was right	1103.0034424002474
18444. phil shut the door behind him	64.92766306688078

18449. i don't get it	2.934656529649969
18450. i don't know phil	said	22.10761915624961
18451. they were silent for a few moments	94.06513390848082
18452. then frankie said:	what are you gonna do	251.59402971980802
18453. phil started to take his clothes	off and frankie sat down on the bench again	1103.0271635877305
18454. phil took off one	shoe and stared at it	392.1571555270749

18463. springfield's in tomorrow frankie said	14.858245280793762

18471. you'll get a job there	14.719547191810975
18472. i'm not worried about it	phil said	140.04288772403908
18473. that's the way to talk	14.776144264046701
18474. what else did eddie	have to say	140.34575967224782
18475. nothing phil said	0.20041515
18476. richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity	391.3580688189273
18477. his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the	subject of religion began to fascinate him	1741.048927597103
18478. when he was twelve he took	to reading st augustine and aquinas then lao-tse confucius	mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous	socio-archaeological papers	4091.8066712466634
18479. for his birthday because richard had	seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend-avesta	and a little image of the indian god acala	3231.02621673901
18480. and one	day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the	book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy	3910.3911141226354
18481. he was	enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to	read	1254.5468348692095
18482. at dinner one night when he was fourteen richard announced	there is only one god	1658.1335369593949
18483. did you think there were	two	43.137586447998295
18484. grinned his father	0.30041514999999996
18485. you don't understand	richard said gloomily	43.381650214347026
18486. through quiet laughter his mother said	don't speak to your father like that richard	1401.986970791341
18487. richard	seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about	religion again	943.1167306766025
18488. his interest in the formal study of religion waned	when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian	affairs	3474.515643916049
18489. although he still didn't speak to anyone he grew fond	of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose	and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new	york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies	4814.759718455085
18490. richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired	in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore	literature life politics and history	4097.298607367122
18491. he was awarded a fellowship to	continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa	upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left	to spend a week at home before leaving the country	4392.3430044946645
18492. the week at	home was not comfortable	139.76249116201618
18493. his mother who had seen little of him for	four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an	orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted	3658.2553588748365
18494. she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days	he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments	of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things	in which he alone was interested	7130.610267936556
18495. do you still have the	book of the dead	263.10440285857123
18496. she asked him and laughing she added i	was nervous about buying a book with a title like that but i knew	you'd like it	3904.6680307489905
18497. yes he lied to shorten the conversation	i still have it	500.76511660272945
18498. he was no longer able to relax in the	presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation	with his mother or father no matter the subject	5004.790037600363
18499. as for the	book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been	incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which	he had lived in new york	3763.9358299936466
18500. he had dusted each of the books carefully	and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open	the big furnace given them up to the flames	4837.763726761641
18501. then he sped from the	dark basement and returned to his room and cried	950.2388261436834
18502. richard left	america with his clothes his biwa and his image of acala and on the	freighter which took him to japan he plucked at the biwa trying	to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had	once heard	6723.446106233832
18503. during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody	out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain	at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure	3940.6240269533837
18504. he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty	north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water	3721.3405371863337
18505. it was so dark	that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean	kept him from hearing it	2467.1375854309854
18506. it was as though the biwa had been eaten	up	by the wind	1193.5938496782317
18507. in tokyo richard took up a life similar to	that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his	biwa with a friend	2853.5351274305985
18508. an american student named charlotte adams had	refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at	last succeeded in getting him to talk to her	4642.276885948239
18509. he had nothing much to	say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied	her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo	3192.9875998995662
18510. in charlotte	richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which	after a fashion he envied	2368.0978886002445
18511. in time he grew to depend upon her occasional	company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate	in more social activity	2583.9984273111822
18512. she convinced him that he ought to be a member	of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms	and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely	that he added anything to the random conversations	6775.336706408057
18513. at one such	gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today	497.2320749424357
18514. have	you ever been to ryusenji	64.63357276357178
18515. no one had	0.20041515
18516. well it's at fudomae	and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in	the pool	2606.763126547833
18517. richard thought it a	more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but	charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial	than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would	lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded	it	5080.574645518342
18518. three of the four persons present all foreign students in	tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by	the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used	as the modifier	6056.303315630508
18519. soba udon and tea were in because they could be	taken noisily	635.7373914515285
18520. sushi was out because it was pretentious	139.60900833159513
18521. sashimi was	in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to	stay	out even if it was a little pretentious	2308.1885839329543
18522. richard had kept his eyes	down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful	to his ears	2837.062013109035
18523. he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my	watching him said charlotte	636.5794589931236
18524. did you watch him	4.442869439192954
18525. asked	a red-haired girl named ceecee witter	94.60421363761158
18526. i shouldn't have been	able to do that	249.77277878547443
18527. well i was able to do it charlotte	said with no sign of irritation	936.088793807177
18528. i'm	surprised no one has been there	141.15825836896758
18529. i've been there a number of times	93.08877381870334
18530. sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo	251.91970166780402
18531. you've never	been to ryusenji	14.68066833674204
18532. i've heard about it samuel	burns said	139.88439223965733
18533. there's a little place there called lovers mound	dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki	789.7540727024768
18534. yes a little parkish	place charlotte said and concluded anyhow it's all	very nice	1407.237894765876
18535. and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried	there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo	1878.1172759275973
18536. oh that's what	i meant to tell you	250.0828827778161
18537. this is the interesting part richard	she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking	1733.120838338868
18538. there	was that fellow out there in the bitter cold-   my	god it was cold today said samuel burns	2571.9369981260843
18539. and the water would be still colder	ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it	1249.3845411325842
18540. and your golden	god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured	himself into a boiling bath	2366.4539948732563
18541. it would kill one of us	43.434663021215655
18542. but	the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked	in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo	the god of fire	4447.376434238615
18543. richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for	the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light	1099.9445906516185
18544. it was true; fudo	the	god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala	2373.319257611417
18545. the conversation went on but richard stopped listening	167.21683035566377
18546. he found	himself trying to remember something but he couldn't decide even the	nature of what it was he worked to recall	3248.8194925377293
18547. he had almost given up	when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of	the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching	3341.654710042089
18548. perhaps	he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter	and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together	3474.407834342721
18549. that night after leaving charlotte's apartment richard walked	about for a time before returning to his room	1418.3341375204877
18550. when he at last did go	to his room he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before	his little image of acala thinking first of charlotte's tale of	the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters	6686.364174143053
18551. and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the train	to fudomae and walked to ryusenji	1875.3013957210933
18552. he was surprised by the sharp	sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte	had mentioned	2370.622574495292
18553. he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the	water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots	high at the back of the pool	3457.0567540097377
18554. on the hillside above was caged what might	have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon	2341.4007589801367
18555. the strange	creature housed in wire made him shudder	261.85625329049424
18556. the sensation he so overwhelmingly	realized was one which told him he had been there before	but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited	to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls	or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach	7523.465784610804
18557. he left the pool	and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of	familiarity with the place would not leave him	2613.2440960515605
18558. into a little well before	the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge	to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash	it against the circle of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call	out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest	8217.652508653735
18559. instead	he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of	stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head	2183.029843835172
18560. the black fudo	seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard's eyes were caught	by the fudo's in fascination and then richard was shocked as	all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudo's face	and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue	were about to burst from some pressure within it	8355.83046375186
18561. then the flames	were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard	began to tremble violently	1721.1322883555047
18562. suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his	coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried	back down both stairways and away from the temple never looking	back	5358.628944989469
18563. he walked all the miles back to his room	263.1977777572837
18564. he seemed to	have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small	cough and felt a bit hot	3702.6979942875123
18565. he stayed home reading and refusing to	think about his frightening experience at ryusenji	940.3415296029259
18566. but the process	of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he	couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day	4466.857794925797
18567. the	cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained	in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about	the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable	feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier	time in his life	5023.98874072292
18568. all of the elements of the experience were impossible	and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never	again to visit the temple at fudomae	4813.446751053856
18569. i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing	the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings	2736.2798051024606
18570. it	had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brother's	son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground	carrying the jar of cool water	5304.15627136885
18571. the boy usually was sent out at about	that time with the water and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath	or a stick along to play with	2986.4159222225812
18572. he pretended that the lath was a tractor	and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor	sounds with his lips	3699.788763861145
18573. i almost ran over the snake before i could	stop the tractor in time	943.5436679433997
18574. i had turned at the corner of the field	and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into	the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and	when i looked again down the furrow the snake was there	7564.684253523359
18575. it lay half	in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly	up to it when i put in the clutch	2599.4768437327225
18576. the tractor was heavily loaded with	the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped	instantly	2590.0829215566637
18577. the snake slid slowly and with great care from the	new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further	2622.1782716072166
18578. i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic	that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was	clean and bright and very beautiful	5479.992006705274
18579. he was multi-colored and graceful	and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only	so slightly	2046.24830786014
18580. go out of the furrow snake i said but it did not move	at all	1632.8854979549678
18581. i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to	frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked	tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern	3861.9803773396975
18582. i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around	the wheel and stood beside it	2591.75467965038
18583. my movement did frighten the snake and	it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped	again and its tongue was working very rapidly	2977.517533543978
18584. i followed it looking	at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and	sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of	a baby's fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the	other and interlaced with glistening jet-black	7377.554584577718
18585. the colors were astonishing	clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of	its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin	vivid and alive and warm	3769.1614373235157
18586. the eyes were clear and black and the slender	body was arched slightly	1182.1057389990538
18587. his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted	as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that	solemn mouth	2468.5063266329967
18588. you beauty i said i couldn't kill you	252.17821430929658
18589. you	are much too beautiful	14.772170376475987
18590. i had killed snakes before when i was younger	but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was	unthinkable that an animal such as that should die	5157.684961744708
18591. i picked him up	and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a	little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored	body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently	because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart	of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make	5633.929583886094
18592. the body	caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned	and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors	could come from the coolness of that body	5778.709772068736
18593. i lowered him so he would	not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from	between my pale hands	2331.8703741989584
18594. the snake worked away very slowly and delicately	and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried	his head a little above the rolled clods	4485.315175743113
18595. the sharp burning colors of	his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target	1576.2098584627322
18596. i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake	395.13460254460927
18597. it shone	in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the	crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself	2461.683852822631
18598. the	color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too	in that dry and dusty and uncolored field	3252.314553339618
18599. i got on the tractor	again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was	drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a	danger of rocks	3755.8004259216314
18600. i had my back to the corner of the triangular field	that pointed towards the house	1895.3145677038033
18601. the earth was a little heavy and i	had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring	properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned	the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field	a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake	5533.31034220521
18602. i saw it all at a glance	141.06618927662612
18603. the boy was there at the lower corner of	the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and	a kind of frenzied impatience	2857.682981070625
18604. even at that distance with no sound but	the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality	on the boy	3691.362750453284
18605. i could see the hunched-up shoulders the savage determination	the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels	and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick	3857.9744812541767
18606. stop it i shouted but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on	above anything i could say	2107.4146185285435
18607. i stopped the tractor and i shouted	down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear	and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering	dance	3844.3933795245603
18608. i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond	light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted	to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch	the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant	of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late	8415.269483488779
18609. i	drove the tractor on not looking down there; i was afraid to look	for fear the evil might still be going on	2315.119198782378
18610. my head began to ache and	the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job	suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful	things and these are soon crushed or they vanish	6572.120328365718
18611. i felt the	anger mount within me	93.4457103094796
18612. the boy waited at the corner with the	jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown bubbly	in the heat of the morning	4818.072040976888
18613. i knew the boy well	14.77942770715919
18614. he was eleven and	we had done many things together	563.8984644595555
18615. he was a beautiful boy really with	finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and	his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue	3330.6431878407916
18616. he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would	smile on any other day	2603.5912708514106
18617. he was my nephew my brother's son handsome	and warm and newly-scrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face	resembled my brother's and mine as well	2857.6232264089085
18618. i saw then too	the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something	there where i had been not long before	3690.50814927315
18619. i stopped the tractor	and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me	1098.011925538837
18620. can i	ride around with you	65.75383509358832
18621. he asked as he often did and i had as often	let him be on the tractor beside me	1728.1324859027457
18622. i looked closely at his eyes	and he was already innocent; the killing was already forgotten in	that clear mind of his	3245.619835853302
18623. no you cannot i said pushing	aside the water jar he offered to me	939.9893626342697
18624. i pointed to the splintered upright	stake	141.28489050216558
18625. did you do that	2.9347419389600864
18626. i asked	0.30041514999999996
18627. yes he	said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement	499.85302871307624
18628. i killed	a snake; it was a big one	393.89861647316854
18629. he tried to take my hand to show	me	258.97804787719144
18630. why did you kill it	22.242513153562996
18631. snakes are ugly and	bad	14.900011132670633
18632. this snake was very beautiful	22.215561530935247
18633. didn't you see	how beautiful it was	92.6816507106623
18634. snakes are ugly he said again	65.05851710518374
18635. you saw the colors of it didn't you	166.84853346085964
18636. have you ever	seen anything like it around here	393.5996109714597
18637. snakes are ugly and	bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died	1256.2682357356048
18638. you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area	559.4366492692795
18639. this	snake could not harm anything	43.25003307985287
18640. they eat chickens sometimes	the boy said	140.78039711306238
18641. they are ugly and they eat chickens and i	hate snakes	500.89559083048533
18642. you are talking foolishly i said	64.84190246077648
18643. you	killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason	787.2950008520559
18644. they're ugly and i hate them the boy insisted	392.1258202323369
18645. it was beautiful i said half to	myself	166.68524457849483
18646. the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented	with what he had done	1647.17220473442
18647. the fire of the colors was gone; there	was a contorted ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and	gray-looking torn and smashed in and dirty from the boy's shoes	3448.2656656522972
18648. the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened	as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted	torn mouth	4325.5526933102765
18649. the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the	cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought	perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had	not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life	4909.258403562776
18650. i wrenched	the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest	part of its body between the colored diamond crystals	3673.4032919696156
18651. i touched it	and the coolness the ice-feeling was gone and even then it moved a	little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it	was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it	4376.360704687865
18652. and then it moved	a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have	to kill it there	3276.2432774850304
18653. the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again	and he was racing innocently in circles making the buzzing tractor	sound with his lips	2995.515463445528
18654. i'm sorry i thought to the snake	for you were beautiful	749.0889822087182
18655. i took the broken length of it around the tractor	and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its	head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live	4126.349405014549
18656. the boy came around behind me dragging the stake	391.8120226782209
18657. it's	a big snake isn't it	43.57839862084801
18658. he said	0.30041514999999996
18659. i'm going to tell everybody	how big a snake i killed	501.9715751487476
18660. don't you see what you	have done	141.30739860722102
18661. i said	0.20041515
18662. don't you see the difference now	65.54175872964268
18663. it's an ugly terrible snake he said	93.93737872197632
18664. he came up and	was going to push at it with his heavy shoes	1404.45323701129
18665. i could see the happiness	in the boy's eyes the gleeful brutality	647.6754751096212
18666. i could have slapped the boy	65.1583649714993
18667. he looked up at me puzzled	and he swayed his head from side to side	1096.9145646815819
18668. i thought you little brute	you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already developed	within that brain and in those eyes	3041.851106063167
18669. i wanted to slap his face to	wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided	then very suddenly what i would do	2862.9590319093923
18670. cady didn't come unglued easily but this had not been a day	of glad tidings	1642.3826733914007
18671. tax worries production worries personnel worries	and the letter from hanford college his own alma mater a real snapper	1738.5293786311038
18672. hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago	564.8250305896062
18673. yes the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic transcript	character references picture health record successful college boards	1415.4865205506842
18674. but due to the many applicants on file would he co-operate and write	a personal letter giving them his son's motivation interests and	his qualifications for leadership	4298.021548414983
18675. cady partlow lit his	pipe with no comfort	167.19031459433845
18676. this was the letter which would	or would not enroll his son david in hanford	1646.3586207777487
18677. his son who had never	held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life	1574.2318299712301
18678. his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant	or chief	1880.4828022146182
18679. he wondered if he had played it wrong	168.02648406701343
18680. maybe	he should have kept in touch	141.11543752595682
18681. but he had been	busy building a business being a big man in his own town just as	he had been a big man at hanford class of 1935	3116.637446428699
18682. besides cady partlow	knew he wasn't the old-grad-type	250.24606540112103
18683. look at pete alcorn who hadn't missed a hanford ball game	in fifteen years	942.7520737571825
18684. hanford college	little	ivy league had no room for football players with low grades	1417.5087551963982
18685. cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride	377.06105078865346
18686. good	solid b average with a sprinkling of a's in math and science	1179.8947405647496
18687. imagine his son being that good in science! mr partlow could	still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered	what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford	3771.3323676071254
18688. but then	he hadn't studied very hard	140.15390012864472
18689. getting elected president of the student	body took a lot of time and politicking	940.9158394664798
18690. he put down his	pipe and started to type	392.9987106194348
18691. in response to your letter i can in good	conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership	1721.8009198178686
18692. he stopped and looked at the picture of his son the picture on	his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate	for hanford college	5013.718412820943
18693. he didn't have to be told his son looked	like him	501.5533889299094
18694. david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair	and a certain rugged ugliness	1656.5394649221375
18695. he turned back to the typewriter with a little more	confidence	505.24915273563056
18696. his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics	tennis and swimming	971.6642216221533
18697. his chief motivation for enrolling at	hanford is the desire to-   mr partlow banged his fist	on the keyboard ruining the letter	2185.6280917454724
18698. he paced to the window and looked	at the city he had helped to build	1653.5714578284442
18699. how do you tell a college	president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do	1412.9898788697535
18700. that	you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him	into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has	known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer- or a lawyer	or an editor	6978.679324526422
18701. how do you tell a college like hanford that	your son has a vast potential that he will find himself	1883.2093924284236
18702. just give	him time give him a chance	250.7935379118191
18703. cady snapped the venetian blind	shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter rolled in a fresh	sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed	on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head	4385.425914352979
18704. what a production to make of a letter commending your own son!	his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic	3251.41698866598
18705. he	told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics	791.6144744412735
18706. he	told hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities	748.1464944078938
18707. he belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming	team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer	of the science club	3127.5538330831455
18708. he finished with a flurry of good	wishes to hanford college and signed the letter	1640.4431464885943
18709. then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph	next to david's	1257.1636137490275
18710. he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket	393.1901031563081
18711. better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything	644.0653592199538
18712. after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those	first lean days of partlow products	2818.8309967343807
18713. anne had a way with words	43.55716052114963
18714. half	of it was natural half was smith college	392.3993435116543
18715. yet the whole	of anne was something she had never learned in any college	939.5561063697057
18716. a woman	had it or she didn't	140.69888950055247
18717. she said what she meant and let	it be	260.88766821708225
18718. she never got on his back	65.39346275739071
18719. he could take the advice or leave	it	166.31900188117342
18720. he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he	got on the elevator	1663.300900829343
18721. you look like you just heard a real gasser	mr partlow	508.59059614874076
18722. cady looked at tom who had taken	him	up and down for fifteen years	1417.7074045758843
18723. i was just thinking how things have	changed	166.32428849479766
18724. when i went to college they begged you to come	562.8322086217661
18725. be our	guest! it's our pleasure! now you have to be well rounded firm	in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge!   tom slid	open	the door to the lobby	2980.857669515913
18726. that's a fact mr partlow	22.360351149183348
18727. my john	applied to six colleges before he got in	372.67998199246944
18728. he's president of the rocket club here	you know	397.1615450879566
18729. always messing around with science stuff	43.56592361809517
18730. real bright along	those lines you might say	250.8841272112742
18731. he got a science scholarship to yale	93.71264285931264
18732. oh	said mr partlow that's fine tom	141.80770475934486
18733. as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady	felt the unease growing	787.0785403087002
18734. he hadn't told anyone but he too had applied	to five colleges for david	1409.7538682790316
18735. they had all turned down his son	94.18372811333856
18736. limited interests	0.30041514999999996
18737. he suddenly realized when he walked	into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini	anne had waiting for him	2322.861475289935
18738. but tonight his drink tasted like branch	water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no	surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket	4999.133502923315
18739. nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did	636.8106031628203
18740. he liked	looking at anne	22.063533654945953
18741. he liked her blond hair and the	sprinkle of freckles across her nose	785.5174900605654
18742. from those navy-blue eyes she	saw things as clearly and honestly as david did	1423.0474042210512

18749. cady deep in thought neither	heard nor answered	166.68285249014986
18750. carefully he put down his	steak knife and said loudly mr chairman!   cady	partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse	3706.048785733829
18751. the car	0.20041515
18752. of course you can have it	65.13619235130852
18753. dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically	and with interest	1257.6936281119363
18754. hear anything from hanford yet dad	64.90060228332507
18755. cady begged the question	2.94200984901578
18756. don't worry about it dave	22.139978729804092
18757. your acceptance will come through	14.816046392645873
18758. dave shrugged on his	sports coat and picked up the car keys	962.1870437626925
18759. don't be too sure dad	14.828941164060112
18760. charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straight-a	student	1192.1960489577405
18761. anne said it wasn't surprising because charles	was antisocial a lone wolf and completely one-sided	1109.1381439377642
18762. i can hardly	say the same about you dave!   dave kissed her lightly	1185.825713482358
18763. girls my dear parent are here to stay! get my old man to	bed early	1096.1800230214626
18764. he looks a little bit frayed	64.80447384686889
18765. anne waited until	the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot	643.8577846184553
18766. let's go into	the library	22.21968203925313
18767. you do seem somewhat tattered	14.706368244566832
18768. cady trailed	her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable	book-lined room	2361.4922592462685
18769. i didn't know i looked so dilapidated!	wrong word darling	378.75553871498323
18770. your fur has been rubbed the	wrong way and you show it	968.0849037941613
18771. need any help	0.20041515
18772. in a way yes	4.4537780442600745
18773. hanford college hasn't decided on dave's application yet	166.35205448606266
18774. they	want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership	965.5429484981463
18775. cady handed her the letter drank his	coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence	1406.002373037543
18776. already he could feel anne's questioning eyes	141.65412680966546
18777. i know you	wrote this in a hurry	but cady dave was only acting president	of the student forum for a few days	2326.4409858563076
18778. that was when half the school	was down with flu	560.3602061522474
18779. and he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club	373.6437639856638
18780. he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball play-off	1410.9344463768991
18781. cady stuck his jaw out	14.665763048757807
18782. the fact remains he was	treasurer	64.88871935618566
18783. no cady he	made second team	43.29353280772114
18784. a team is a team insisted cady	141.0300812079103
18785. anything	else	0.20041515
18786. yes she said quietly	4.395575425756933
18787. i don't think	you've been quite honest cady	167.88549419823005
18788. astronomy	0.30041514999999996
18789. he was mad about stars at the age of nine	375.0430224111362
18790. geology	you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond	six years ago! those aren't his interests now	3280.3518828201422
18791. what	do you suggest	2.929589447305926
18792. just say he likes swimming tennis	chess and music	393.95862092312916
18793. music! he hasn't been to a symphony	concert all season	374.8834993462875
18794. but he plays bass	with chief crazy horse and his five colts!   you	mean that rock-and-roll combo	2120.763824525903
18795. even in that he never solos like jack	on guitar or rich on sax	944.3283250677702
18796. he's- he's just there that's	all	65.07513986520976
18797. he keeps the beat going	14.76313521614072
18798. he	likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo	749.6407546199563
18799. he doesn't	like to rise and shine	93.6952153223707
18800. don't worry cady he'll be back in the	beethoven fold by next year	1180.2073680499366
18801. but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention	chief crazy horse and his five colts	1255.4652886937674
18802. anne laughed and	cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck	1882.3889342517582
18803. maybe	i am padding it a bit anne he said	371.99627287356464
18804. but you know how hard	it is to get a boy into a good college	1645.1139656292823
18805. he has to have leadership	as well as grades	262.93475904790785
18806. anne folded the worrisome document	22.14549400380111
18807. did	you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this	weekend	790.9297236568128
18808. he hasn't used it now for several years	250.5686894130825
18809. can you really	say his motivation for college is electronics	374.5950660418797
18810. cady felt	the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel	1656.9394180417137
18811. and what	would you say he wants to do	262.8592269691127
18812. just what	0.30041514999999996
18813. it's	dave who is applying to hanford college	168.05695203652192
18814. why don't you ask him	22.27956772148236
18815. for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so	he could yell back	1107.8291082948433
18816. i have talked to him but you know i've never	tried to push him into any profession	2128.7804994615626
18817. i won't be guilty of trying	to run his life	372.49740817743213
18818. anne picked up the towel she was hemming	for the hospital guild	965.713778664695
18819. just because your father tried to make	a banker out of you you've leaned over backward to keep your hands	off	2026.3948920080006
18820. but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold	561.7046981264973
18821. you want him to be a leader of men like you	502.4137442487239
18822. cady put the	well-worn chip back on his shoulder	394.7564091541081
18823. dave has qualities of leadership	14.78346379573191
18824. he just hasn't developed them yet	64.71568372770636
18825. he never will cady	2.9614132341728387
18826. not the kind of leadership you mean working	with lots of people	957.8478096769766
18827. all your wishful thinking won't change	that	93.39158494296223
18828. remember what you used to say in the army	392.02923166316407
18829. you can't run a war	with ninety-nine generals and one private!   cady walked	the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne	2741.931055602675
18830. martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist	at all	1404.8589537927846
18831. and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions	261.0573252893123
18832. the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life	394.8463171774947
18833. lying awake	at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind	1261.8975795267036
18834. when	he rose in the morning the image was still there	748.4040348118137
18835. he had always	been a messy and negligent man	261.5793344174921
18836. in his bachelor days his bedroom	had been strewn with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid	generally saw fit to put in order	4105.061004869461
18837. no doubt dolores resented following	in their footsteps	166.3033317043209
18838. but it was fun those first days kidding	about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug	2579.767627493616
18839. there	was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up	782.3131051597203
18840. half	slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things	750.2101714501006
18841. he	remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party	1094.8156635616465
18842. the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled	against it like petals	1880.0461119315855
18843. her hair was the color of those blooms which	in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower	is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple	or blue- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers	searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its	true shade beneath the darkness	5693.989033417836
18844. so he sought her out and spoke	to her and thought of his hand in her hair	2095.69474509372
18845. or against her back	pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently	straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking	noises like the snapped stem of a tulip	3754.561922630597
18846. but to put it	bluntly nothing snapped	139.83973512790595
18847. yet that had not seriously troubled him	not then	258.6769792098136
18848. more he could take at leisure	64.68583469080343
18849. all martin	thought he needed was time: to what better use could time be put	1094.0187132760589
18850. he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly	753.9247143986418
18851. there	was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong	delights of emotional clash and meeting	1415.9669624650812
18852. they had left themselves	too much to discover	249.79811769682846
18853. but at the start his new life felt invigorating	260.37020069698985
18854. it was on the tenth day after the wedding	that he dropped the shorts on the floor	2137.6324061808455
18855. now i'm not going to pick up those shorts!	martin gave her a teasing pat	1089.9000061170539
18856. i think you'll get tired of	them there	246.64025584853752
18857. in the morning the shorts were where he had left	them	502.2489612085954
18858. he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till	dolores did	1171.7218126918747
18859. it was almost too easy	14.951849999504883
18860. for he had just remembered:	tonight they were having their first guests	964.8862405024577
18861. the shorts would not be	on the floor when he came home that evening	941.1019683973624
18862. the	rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in	the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts	3483.139678704666
18863. they gave the room	a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face	1263.0404551638198
18864. he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking	he would get nervous	1880.9080000873078
18865. quietly he determined to foil her	43.126499441311275
18866. i can	be as stubborn as she can he thought; my nerves are as strong	1659.3685142076513
18867. she'll	rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings	263.1012648513634
18868. martin was standing a few feet from the front	door	563.2600792706609
18869. he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet	away	505.9680832799294
18870. dolores stood motionless in the doorway	65.29980658296527
18871. he could not cross	the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts	1419.922029155086
18872. he strode to answer the bell	65.4307496757142
18873. bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet	166.76849630238684
18874. with the most casual	and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom	1884.7171525949525
18875. at first he could not be sure	93.59213320944085
18876. then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there	1171.8119523713603
18877. a glissade of giggles slid over their voices	167.48961843618127
18878. all evening anthea	favored him with odd coy looks	391.8768261264943
18879. clearly she had been instructed	not to say a word	374.33766337304746
18880. for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation	spread until it swallowed up every other topic	1876.5428918006787
18881. at last there	was a void no one could fill	376.9649789519357
18882. the brainards went home early	22.210825636850068
18883. martin realized later on that he should have had it out with	dolores that night	1095.1566776874708
18884. but he was so taken	aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in	2580.971785823239
18885. on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while	she stayed calm and adamant	1569.804782563173
18886. and if he surrendered after raving	at her	249.21509407797362
18887. suppose he ran up the white flag altogether	167.66014118354343
18888. at once	0.30041514999999996
18889. he considered the sober possibility	14.870881069366916
18890. in	his head was the echo of those titters with anthea	748.9508274064023
18891. there was	something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel	scabrous and unclean	1108.8406929692258
18892. he remembered his mother gossiping with her	neighborhood women friends	lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness	which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he	crouched listening	5349.775961159052
18893. he could even recall the last time he sat there	373.07450823674105
18894. she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing	something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry	3687.17321387251
18895. he apologized so sweetly i couldn't keep being annoyed with	him	503.84269178038824
18896. it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time;	he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened	which was as honest as he could put it	5469.040735484966
18897. but his mother told the	story over and over till her martin said he was sorry was as	much a part of her as the shape of her thin pallid ears	3318.8816482568827
18898. the	battle had to be fought	65.017082695961
18899. let the best sex win	14.810559333849316
18900. but his resolution	hardly seemed to help	139.754413246778
18901. if the situation had been bad it now got	worse	377.1203512449255
18902. about this time people began dropping in considering	that the newly married had been left alone long enough	2345.0275666922744
18903. angrily martin	wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip- preferably	one that lasted months- instead of deciding not to postpone the date	until he could get away	3332.800493269777
18904. here they were at the mercy of anyone who	chose to come by	1174.9965316292955
18905. these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores	showing them around the apartment	789.5211500984759
18906. of course the tours of inspection	included the ever-present shorts	560.4954627470246
18907. it was curious how the	different visitors took this	259.98727010044604
18908. some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's	countenance	565.597600529576
18909. to them	all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale	375.11078814993573
18910. it's a little	contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying	the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course	3056.714109048108
18911. while he waited	in the living room	94.61532785515564
18912. they entered the	bedroom and dolores said nothing	249.5369566681226
18913. then one of the guests showed his	merriment	167.68070716427044
18914. you were in a hurry weren't you	141.80500888680368
18915. martin would	have liked to break the man's neck	262.45552547931345
18916. dolores smiled; she let the	interpretation stand	141.419473665941
18917. now martin heard himself give a snort of mock	good nature	503.4858555784106
18918. with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to	begin: it's a little contest-   never again did he	enter into the ritual of showing the apartment	4473.797734431011
18919. they kept up a	rigid pretense of speaking relations	261.2774752994178
18920. but martin seldom felt the impulse	to talk about anything	561.4612341117397
18921. what to talk about	2.9700691245991484
18922. dolores kept	picking up any of his clothes which he left	about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions	3470.216770539332
18923. he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets	so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers	2468.3776114147163
18924. in his moments of worst agony martin	imagined what his friends were saying	1168.593116318698
18925. the sound of their amazement	14.840749565266526
18926. bizarre: he could hear the word	65.8347635766233
18927. we were up to visit them and h   he had thought her exactly	what he wanted	1252.4607520864015
18928. six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense	he told himself furiously	1415.03474301566
18929. pursuing his idea he saw that it would	be impossible to leave her now	935.6631374651109
18930. everyone would know why; he would	cut a supremely ridiculous figure	757.5624225395086
18931. day	and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made	for himself	1428.2496602018416
18932. his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit	142.2661108850032
18933. alternately	he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly	morosely to live out his life in this fashion	2016.0988758474537
18934. nothing would	change nothing would ever change	140.0891141442354
18935. when the solution finally	came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity	that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before	3653.9906834116896
18936. in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan	391.22876887878795
18937. beside his shorts he would place something of hers	262.8001512020236
18938. instantaneously	he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked	up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his	shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost the same	6060.466002369867
18939. he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick	up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor	2465.895116634091
18940. furthermore	he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: every time he went	in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle	next to his shorts	5207.110749314804
18941. sooner or later dolores would crack	43.74765231644477
18942. on the	other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would be difficult	to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment	4075.8536627063286
18943. martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the	next installment of her story	1404.1766325056044
18944. the tale he thought would become less	gay	249.67537225322394
18945. she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness	his lack of control his general male looseness while she	remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined	an unruly body	3852.603469289514
18946. to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor	would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd	3076.1075876847144
18947. something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence	of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed	in it since his courage and virility were involved because it	was truly his	4295.66071713118
18948. the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death	and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted	fanaticism	4098.1579597353075
18949. the next morning while dolores was out of	the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace	pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts	3420.7345561765032
18950. he sat down on	the bed	65.42280666899109
18951. in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared	93.25448650551473
18952. to	his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments	965.8973829572539
18953. slowly and	deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers	then hesitated for about a second	1718.0817752704734
18954. ah he thought she's going through	the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well	pick up my shorts too	3472.0891407340278
18955. he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the	implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him	2318.180222851316
18956. extending	her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly	left the room	1654.0569483576103
18957. she did not look at him but he noticed that her face	was flushed and her eyes unsteady	1567.771834963329
18958. they breakfasted together	but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great	deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that	talk was impossible	5481.629246952225
18959. well martin thought that'll save	14.734001950728663
18960. he left	for work in high spirits	141.67011211428343
18961. as he relaxed that day martin realized	how tense he had been these past weeks	1103.3894089728021
18962. he found that he no longer	hated dolores and he was	surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling	2593.2463503176773
18963. good old a-z cap said	14.791552074311491
18964. you know i've got	one of your cars at home	561.8132027326417
18965. as a prominent industrialist you ought to	be interested in his nibs' support group	945.003944352689
18966. isn't his racket down	your alley	65.45734295168599
18967. once it was william thought	14.88882028964088
18968. a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap	756.7497350260267
18969. how did he start on such a ride to brief glory	502.0840022103359
18970. simply enough	through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law	391.6872574733579
18971. general hershey's	draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first	eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared	to for the second time	3098.024144981243
18972. freddy needed a job having been	detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper	financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him	with one	5188.425306870629
18973. mr willis bought zenith plastic products a	skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and	whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long	island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy	in an executive position	4371.973662325343
18974. shortly after freddy had his usual	proliferation of bold ideas	561.3454177989054
18975. willis listened patiently and once in a	while william was exposed to them at a family gathering; he generally	heard freddy's suggestions without interest being absorbed by	his own prospering concerns	3324.2556649337116
18976. probably mr willis was influenced	toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for	his grandchildren	2119.2115986610247
18977. gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded	no doubt by joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating	competency	2014.3824844083597
18978. another factor must have been the eventual disposal	of willis' fortune; she unquestionably assumed that the more	he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy	richly upon his death	5458.969045143804
18979. whatever the reasons willis and bryan	started expanding zenith	260.6036218319796
18980. they acquired another electronics factory	a specialized ceramics company an organization that built- very	experimentally- high-speed research calculators	2367.02099100862
18981. since they were	hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising	resources entered the combination as a silent partner because	of his political connections	2855.1220833635534
18982. feeling his power freddy looked	for additional worlds to conquer	559.3009953447074
18983. heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible	government coffers attracted him	263.4914997901884
18984. the allstates auto	company a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles	and other off-road equipment had recently constructed an over-large	modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism	4480.48954958201
18985. cursed with a shaky	management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation	and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and	small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences	3539.3609864893237
18986. with	herberet's blessing he was convinced that allstates' wisconsin	folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly tanks	missiles or ordnance of some kind	3880.404661795251
18987. at that point william	came into the picture	169.1920600414672
18988. although not much desiring the account he had	been appointed advertising head of zenith	1407.3880100726856
18989. freed of routine by having	his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had	given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate	structure; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he	did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities	5027.700989445209
18990. mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice	beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious	study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington	5619.614993415617
18991. in the end he said: i'm not enchanted by the proposition	sir	639.007064131228
18992. i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young	engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates	3691.2852207037504
18993. it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what	you have in mind	1261.0057459888703
18994. the conversion will cost a fortune	65.48310153426519
18995. besides that	i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through	my contacts in the air force	1733.9555447540247
18996. i think adam herberet is guilty	of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than	on the technical side	3054.6979317503137
18997. missiles have thrown everything up for grabs	and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here	1570.5051118751157
18998. the future of manned	aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet	transports have revolutionized the airline trade- one jet can take	the place of three compound-engine planes	4829.846942857258
18999. this means the aircraft companies	are going to tear into the government market looking for anything	they can get and making the competition tough	2474.420148026461
19000. here are a few facts	and figures i've assembled	392.78467787121696
19001. can't you stay with what you have	and wait till the dust settles	793.8546038525812
19002. willis glanced at the bound	pages given him and shrugged	565.1433219097541
19003. well he said there is freddy	you know h	262.9487429245631
19004. freddy is deeply committed to our	plans already	250.19879283895685
19005. he assures me he has people to handle the money raising	and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding	of zenith and allstates are no problem	3218.860671433589
19006. i don't like to exhibit	the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution	1412.150460358203
19007. i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm	lukewarm; i've caused him trouble before and he's beginning	to resent me	1722.4446974117695
19008. if we don't take care the sisters will be entering the	fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels	2349.3729282585937
19009. which	is a frightful prospect bill	42.959939420826935
19010. one shouldn't	mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have	no choice h	1868.638871455138
19011. let me think about it	14.835804729735358
19012. i'm most grateful to you so	grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy	2119.784261540879
19013. not to william's surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert	prevailed; allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying	her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william	was unwilling to interfere further	3937.130845089602
19014. zenith absorbed allstates	stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated	combination	1637.4483582731007
19015. through jack hamrick william fell into the	world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and	clay	1741.7817117911447
19016. he forgot about a-z till unhappily he and hamrick	were proved correct	962.2441694588288
19017. freddy's backing dropped away from him	and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit	1258.440998384064
19018. adam beset by	changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the	new corporation couldn't deliver from his end	3478.830607828889
19019. the wisconsin plant	turned out to be a white elephant	374.022623786724
19020. stock willis held in abundance	fell sharply in value	389.1968810936129
19021. confronted by a grim future freddy lost his	nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation	1095.460452906385
19022. once more willis	summoned william	22.433050590314807
19023. you were right he said- you and your	engineer- and i'm in something of a bind	1253.6166764701125
19024. freddy's solution	doesn't appeal to me	64.54394045314348
19025. in addition to other defects i'm a stubborn	man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment	2031.7026419164436
19026. will you see if you can help me	251.59899861183854
19027. william spent a long	week end closeted with hamrick	262.05070711132083
19028. his recent experience in motor car advertising	a love for cars of themselves the existence of a-z's	useless wisconsin set-up exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick's	that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure	of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga	motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid	to broach it	8273.720752378544
19029. initially hamrick's reaction to a-z going	into the passenger car market was discouraging	788.4265942762346
19030. he thought the financing	the advertising the production of new models the founding of	a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult	3478.630605441863
19031. if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their	presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely	the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable	h	3460.693452112688
19032. they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics	and put their arguments down in black and white	2371.3210981957836
19033. taking hamrick	with him william went to mr willis	262.69818316051817
19034. he was surprised and dubious	but impressed by the engineer and the report	1182.9340892815078
19035. your alternative	is breathtaking he said and i'm frank in saying	a bit mad	938.0833920607763
19036. i wish i was younger and less timid h	392.22258965780236
19037. well i can't	resolve this myself	43.536941750912334
19038. i'll have to call in the brain trust	249.93118225999152
19039. are you	willing to run the gantlet	94.18674414715659
19040. i can't guarantee you a sympathetic	audience	141.9662139723056
19041. we'll be in there swinging william said	but in a way sir you've got to decide it yourself	1568.0683608601498
19042. you have	the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours-	and besides nobody else is going to have the courage	3060.8175443358423
19043. if they follow	anyone it'll have to be you	261.9550999883003
19044. i should explain:	there's more here for me than advocating my little dream there's	you	1642.0767690066593
19045. you mustn't take a fall or publicly back away	264.61760422040606
19046. you're- you're arthur willis h	22.42935365531607
19047. forgive the hearts and	flowers theme	43.6712034865415
19048. i rather like the music willis replied	quietly	250.4839624403433
19049. at the meeting attended by freddy	richert herberet and the a-z executive staff with	mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet	2616.6359342509645
19050. from shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open	resistance and animosity	1644.9488213847271
19051. oh my god ham richert	said a little child shall lead them	637.9612801246656
19052. it's absurd bill freddy said from a pale face	393.9249044784909
19053. you're leading dad down the garden path	94.87789381045188
19054. your	garden	god damn it! william said	140.6381046651141
19055. i don't enjoy family	quarrels adam said	93.43120847474292
19056. we're here to	transact business	22.331998582087607
19057. can't we put an end to this arthur	166.83308836707738
19058. hear me out please william begged	66.05838442541395
19059. i'm an advertising	hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere	1411.8975416715673
19060. sure ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big	three	965.6815093149071
19061. their cars weren't small enough they didn't have the	power they were old-fashioned	778.24242916853
19062. they tried to sell 'em on economy and	simple merit	562.268535026961
19063. we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery	261.97997266403115
19064. we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age	1185.690073147304
19065. look what those little european jobs are doing	166.70597128827717
19066. we'll woo the	consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length	and weight	1894.1165805116082
19067. let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and	a seduction at reasonable rates	1255.3159306140549
19068. ticonderoga folded a few minutes too	soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid- and the network	of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again-	waiting for us ready-made	5606.262157649898
19069. we've got rid of the steam yachts	and georgian houses and the bloated too-expensive automobile is	next	1425.0017619555401
19070. why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with	an allstates-zenith	1656.1535567261217
19071. he swayed them somewhat but the	debate raged on	263.23299859236215
19072. financing emerged as the main obstacle	65.70497360404923
19073. mr willis	made it evident that he had contributed his maximum	500.3433006525576
19074. nobody	will underwrite it i'm telling you freddy said	391.05370079154267
19075. i know	what i'm talking about in that department	259.7674759255442
19076. there's	plenty of risk money ham richert added but not for anything	this risky	1401.5165872937612
19077. we'll	try to swing the deal on that basis	262.6256594926003
19078. if we can't raise the capital	we're through	249.62268774664494
19079. you're up against it anyhow	14.710766550849883
19080. why won't you give me a chance	140.4242101742988
19081. a silence fell	0.20041515
19082. heads instinctively turned in willis' direction	64.90216185884125
19083. he smiled at william	and slowly rubbed his hands together	374.8432810180992
19084. i feel i must	answer the question he said since the onus later if any should	fall on me- i don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside	my family h	4633.826878895654
19085. i'm not giving you a chance bill but availing	myself of your generous offer of assistance	1255.6355092076606
19086. all the in-laws have got to have their day adam said and	glared at william and freddy in turn	2589.7641108226085
19087. sweat started out on	william's forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not	tell	1101.0453841267724
19088. across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled	thumb and forefinger	1187.2198637422903
19089. spike-haired	burly red-faced decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy	league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club	1896.3573457186478
19090. hello boss he said and grinned	65.13120072529134
19091. i suppose i can never	expect to call you 'general' after that washington episode	944.6472736565878
19092. it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco!	for it seems that barco fancying himself a ladies' man	had listed himself for mormon beard roles	at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: with	your beard dear you ought to be in movies!   mills	secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to	the hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five	minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail	of cal barco	0.30166232349522504
19093. on their way they stopped at every gas station	along the main boulevards to question the attendants	1413.6686657922291
19094. finally at ye	olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue they learned that	their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the	route to san diego	4998.716081509554
19095. they headed in that direction and at san juan	capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old	spanish mission drive-in eating a hot tamale	2739.6420144281615
19096. at the moment barco's	back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in	on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they	proceeded to search	5313.95816615206
19097. the robe however was missing for by that time	barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale	1722.264334404223
19098. the detectives	placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the	nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning	3475.4663261072105
19099. thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began	to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered	2311.294289722011
19100. during	the return trip barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless	phrases such as: they're under sand dunes h they're better	off i tell you h i saved their souls	4851.085138382361
19101. the detective commenting	on barco's behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad	citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged- that he was	a more or less harmless nut!   however while in his cell	awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an	attempt to take his own life	5178.4392565339085
19102. the attempt had failed because when	endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted	at the sight of blood	3474.614092602699
19103. the jail authorities- attaching no particular	significance to the episode- offered barco whisky to revive him;	but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more	was thought of the matter	3568.009574015409
19104. then it was that district attorney	welch entered the case	558.438567442882
19105. a man of vaulting ambition with one eye	on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might	possibly lead to personal publicity	2592.370973393822
19106. it was reported to welch's	office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide	1891.5485146905692
19107. welch	wanted to know why	14.823058242087825
19108. now welch had a pet theory that	everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at	2812.1066189399494
19109. the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory	to the test	1267.3076234240336
19110. so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their	chat by stating bluntly:   barco we've got the goods	on you! it'll be a lot better if you come clean	5351.769644639984
19111. at	first barco was evasive and shifty	93.66237626770118
19112. but with welch's relentless pursuit	of the subject barco finally broke and started confessing	to one murder after another	2591.4873475016834
19113. by the time barco reached the count	of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true	1867.717032725813
19114. but	if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would	throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great	murder trial	5022.982275482288
19115. welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell	93.54644868913601
19116. but to welch's chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed welch's	credulity in barco's confession	1184.7561851193047
19117. barco was clearly a nut	14.875347068248638
19118. it required strength bravado daring to commit murder	250.28628108381048
19119. that worm	a murderer	2.9548696264736485
19120. ridiculous! then for the first time since his	arrest a glint of spirit lit barco's eyes	1884.8062398836544
19121. his manhood had been attacked	14.745163940541554
19122. he stiffened and rose to his feet	139.92667731263109
19123. he'd show them!	is that so	43.55833390639363
19124. he queried	0.30041514999999996
19125. well for ten years i've been	murdering women	168.5231479933112
19126. i can lead you to every one of the bodies and there	ain't four nor five nor six of 'em- there's	seven!	the next day the police captain in derision organized what	he termed welch's wild goose chase	6060.396192581588
19127. for indeed it seemed	incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and	not get caught at it even in hollywood	2463.1051563041474
19128. the searching party consisted	of the police captain welch barco policemen with shovels newspaper	reporters and cameramen	2119.7219324276325
19129. barco his state of apprehension	gone never to return had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained	his principal attitude from that time on	2171.9709689388333
19130. he directed the cortege	of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica	1189.598033377239
19131. stopping the cars at	a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot	between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location	3124.492166760834
19132. orders were given to dig	22.20155153499722
19133. welch was worried	0.20041515
19134. the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again	barco's pride was aroused	752.9421566116805
19135. with greater precision he again paced	off a location this time a little more to the left	1420.1935501919477
19136. with	quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging	391.9433348881327
19137. the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when	finally one of the shovels struck an object	2192.2766924327216
19138. there's something	here! said the digger	65.5096356445378
19139. joking stopped and everyone gathered	around	43.51213186618135
19140. the digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into	view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's hollywood	sport shirts	3487.7275390289988
19141. although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains	it was enough	789.3075378523077
19142. welch was wild with delight	22.341548603251965
19143. his elation grew	as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another	950.0789412363574
19144. now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything	that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph	for	him	3884.688622293964
19145. it went to his head and his ambition increased	262.64128134074804
19146. it was	apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power	as da to drag every possible sensation into the case	3899.6642738180685
19147. every	new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall's	pen would thus mean more publicity for welch	1587.084181463445
19148. i knew that both	these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when	viola was called to the stand	3037.7211072206374
19149. once there the da with devilish	cleverness would provide marshall with headlines: viola's	multiple romancesh viola lake an addicth downfall	of another film idol! it would be fine publicity for the	man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken	reputation of a helpless girl!   i studied welch closely as	the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how	he might be thwarted	0.20124717349522497
19150. it wasn't long before i sensed that there was	something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for	viola's destruction	3026.567354567805
19151. he was bitter and resentful toward her personally	resentful	261.5468238111831
19152. a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps	he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors- or even	more serious perhaps that he had attained a share of them and had	then been superseded by some luckier chap	5932.065012389622
19153. i did not rest until i had	tracked the mystery down	504.5023678346391
19154. one day over a	year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown	hotel	2596.3176174980485
19155. viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing	the host or the character of the party she had gone	2178.822949758334
19156. she arrived	late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be	in the majority; the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were	in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor	6298.974301706314
19157. naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she	couldn't leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her	host	2437.9304623314138
19158. and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken	refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;	while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which	as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch	7423.8415713867025
19159. as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes	and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds	between the toes	2999.4617514341235
19160. a little later the district attorney woke	up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized	he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture	forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine	room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was	to preside	8248.255653664519
19161. he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully	brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected	his hat from the many on the bed	3130.039350698684
19162. then noting neither the absence	of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way	to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum	4840.66884627431
19163. the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined	641.673608354965
19164. the incident aside from reflecting on welch's political	career had all but wrecked his home life	1897.0481415984516
19165. he never rested until	he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance	on viola lake if ever the chance came his way	2844.9546591621183
19166. and here it was!	by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in	motion	1637.781632411189
19167. during these first days of the trial i didn't have	as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked	2175.4261648687707
19168. in the	first place it was difficult for us to meet	748.1369154790879
19169. we couldn't be seen	together for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names	and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association	of a man with a girl no matter how innocent	4288.799377792733
19170. i couldn't invite	viola to our house for mother snobbishly refused to receive her	1404.765354625369
19171. now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values	but mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had	opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her	3436.1419288775965
19172. there mother	was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated	by the budweisers the chalmers	and the heinzes		2004.2204973932694
19173. i hated being dragged into the salons of these	aristocrats	377.1795919031305
19174. but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone	remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive	midsts	3243.674258300721
19175. in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited	at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred	barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi	3664.1632870008616
19176. mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial	opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and	with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was	a girl who had been to high school	6684.887879313754
19177. but at long last came a time when	i broke away from mother and her society chi-chi in order	to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home	3434.291709725756
19178. however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that	every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered	to the world society and even alas to my own mother	5923.8154679492045
19179. when i arrived at viola's	i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen	943.4047571053703
19180. viola greeted me in checked apron ladle in hand and explained	it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing	dinner	3674.2450544436606
19181. i sat and watched proceedings	14.847726763838114
19182. there was to be roast	chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig	of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes- all chosen prepared	and cooked by viola herself	4983.607333151458
19183. i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem	but his agony could have been no greater	1726.29073614876
19184. the most that was accomplished	was adding mrs beige's tray to the dish pile and by means	of repeated threats on an ascending scale seeing that the girls dressed	themselves after a fashion	5345.044039209171
19185. i was saved from making the	decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly	1577.048942390294
19186. here's	a household hint: if you can't find your children and get tired	of calling them pick up the phone	2811.471094597372
19187. no matter if your children are	at the movies in school visiting their grandmother or on a field	trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within seconds	after you pick up the phone	3966.6444011366925
19188. jennie and miranda twined themselves	around me murmuring endearments	390.578572930672
19189. louise climbed onto a stool	and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming	my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency	2860.3871767244677
19190. somehow	managing to get out a cool poised won't you hold on a second	please i covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less	poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter	including devil's island and the remoter reaches of siberia	7173.705456762871
19191. i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed	till after the call was completed	1574.6281742787983
19192. speaking into the phone	again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice	1412.7112337191963
19193. soon	we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little	things like jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black	out miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table	and various screeches thuds and giggles	4367.666631899877
19194. under the circumstances	i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when	i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to	remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it	was that hank and i be there	7205.293365431605
19195. i discovered that the girls had	shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living	room	1579.4776332703764
19196. it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace	and quiet instead of carrying out my threats	3051.955881614981
19197. resolving to get	something done i started in on the dishes	503.3853296208798
19198. i'm not saying	it right	22.14896167683994
19199. what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the	dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink	2444.4230803846053
19200. they looked	so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring	at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again this time about	francesca and her husband	4461.084598759812
19201. how about them i thought	14.77334031882923
19202. francesca	and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia	953.1044631853453
19203. we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved- at that	time they had called on us after i met fran at a pta meeting	and had taken us in hand socially	3750.247419054026
19204. they had been kind to us and	we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information	as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter	to call	just a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly		5663.020637601085
19205. herb an expert on narrow	ties thin lapels and swatches was men's fashion editor of parvenu	the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation	2316.709005905095
19206. fran	and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from	nebraska or was it wyoming	2846.9962148047903
19207. she was the daughter and sole heiress	of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived	in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields	3553.762772727684
19208. she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some	money into a broadway show which was successful	2373.1364633476524
19209. it was during her writing period that she and herb	met and decided that they were in love	1566.3047165169091
19210. they were married at a lavish	ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines	and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda	3870.4333217732114
19211. bermuda was not in style that year	92.99396701035087
19212. they had honeymooned in	rome; everyone was very high on rome that year	1175.0816475105182
19213. they had bought	their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of	suburbia surrounding new york; they had chosen catatonia because	of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names	3542.9513204028312
19214. you are bound to get involved with people when you have	children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good	to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little	housewives and dull husbands but people who do things	7115.753095391019
19215. i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape	an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things	2324.7353584954294
19216. their house was a centuries-old colonial which they had had restored	and updated and added on to	2123.2420444910467
19217. it had	a gourmet's corner a breakfast room a luncheon	room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a	party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud	3703.47048832106
19218. it was	all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children	would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play	with	blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper	rooms at exactly the right time	7442.786212266443
19219. their two boys were well adjusted	and like their parents always did the right thing at the right	time and damn the consequences	2327.573044711152
19220. francesca and herbert considered	themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were	by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings	and other art objects		3047.7521113611792
19221. fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against	the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by	wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in color; bright	pinks and plaids and vivid stripes	3461.252562875519
19222. sometimes she even wore the uniform	in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely	wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the	ss	4663.3501310804295
19223. no one could dislike them i thought	93.39782585641528
19224. sometimes though they	did not seem quite human	247.7900242063046
19225. it seemed indeed that their house was	not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were	actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent	enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement	4609.331747691037
19226. practically	the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing	names; even brand names	1636.5413918581596
19227. you should hear the reverence in	fran's voice when she said baccarat or steuben or madame	alexander	1415.6888507761096
19228. she always let it be known that there was wine	in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy and	that koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs	5303.856370142274
19229. i wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not	for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally	unreal	2568.9609902227758
19230. i couldn't feel at home among them	139.99239889689562
19231. besides francesca	there was blanche	14.876224555818848
19232. francesca was pleasant and charming but blanche	was sweet	393.3729992137561
19233. yes blanche was very very sweet- being in her company	was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows	1566.7185920548632
19234. i had once been	a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness	oh my souffle has collapsed	3074.9507061525114
19235. anyone knows how a real	red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe! if blanche	had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of	doors and thrown a few little valueless things	3868.964311319088
19236. but dear me no;	not blanche	65.49495240485138
19237. after five minutes with blanche one might welcome	the astringency	of grazie who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca's	perle mesta	2324.7275720403695
19238. francesca and grazie were habitual committee	chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen equal	bosses of whatever pta or civic project was being launched	4076.4687752734703
19239. they	were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because	they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals	for social leadership	3192.7264456799667
19240. grazie was mean: quietly mean and bitterly	unfunnily sarcastic	392.5892182256749
19241. she it was who had looked to see if i was	wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive	1737.3821497420086
19242. grazie had a small	slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast	2119.781296645862
19243. she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointments paint	and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring; the pets	were a couple of siamese cats	2858.980316367065
19244. her uniform was of rich raw silk in	a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since	she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen	fish stick	5782.1475648678725
19245. the husbands of these women and others i had	met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at	least indistinguishable	2453.7613299990903
19246. i couldn't tell one from the other	142.34715916716965
19247. like	herbert they were all in communications: radio television magazines	and advertising	638.9191714992526
19248. one or two were writers of books; all were fellows	of finite charm	1167.1750333368884
19249. each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and	the habit of saying zounds! in deference to country-squirehood	1257.2380863295102
19250. i never thought i'd live to hear people chuckle and say zounds!	in real life	1643.531308125172
19251. i wouldn't have missed it for anything	93.58358606232193
19252. they	were sincere- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent	smile	971.6194650732407
19253. these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently	pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed misty-eyed	with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting	3533.9642541130843
19254. could such	unadulterated love for a total stranger be credited	563.5001815419475
19255. they were	always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses	and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that	i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops	3956.178157090614
19256. o pioneers! i thought and wondered what	kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban	frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher	conferences and who never called the school principal mister	5897.866750854636
19257. i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed	to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85000	yearly; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get	on person to person; people who thought it was nice to be important	but not important to be nice; who were more ingratiating than	gracious more personalities than persons	5747.533455614329
19258. in my estimation they	were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka; well	not discussed him exactly but said kafka! reverently	and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they	felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about	kafka not having read kafka	7808.296409869389
19259. they were i felt people invariably	trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine	what not who others were	2432.8245704847186
19260. becoming aware that it was nearly	lunchtime i brought myself back to the tasks at hand	1875.3297956291367
19261. i made plans	for the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at	once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen	2471.7320611468235
19262. then i	remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the	last week	2375.971118783884
19263. bananas! jennie had shouted each time	43.29279518389207
19264. they're	not dessert! they're not even food	140.8493535060153
19265. they're just something	you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast	499.7567465283103
19266. i dug around	and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food	cake with chocolate icing	2823.651606412496
19267. rule for cooking: if you can't put garlic in it put chocolate in	the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence	in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing	3864.326631049183
19268. then jennie closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said:	take my hand louise; i'm a stranger in paradise	2813.767443161254
19269. needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion	upon free enterprise	785.4013929905552
19270. how dared they demand to snoop in private	financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements	1648.3785282712427
19271. it is as though i said on the historic three-hour coast-to-coast	radio broadcast which i bought	and pre-empting the eddie cantor manhattan merry-go-round and	that man in the white house like some despot	of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking	my lingerie! my impassioned plea for civil rights created	a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider	replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis	0.20124717349522497
19272. but	what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator	who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great	nation	4670.372400361883
19273. the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended	on the athens that was mighty metronome sacking and despoiling	with their bolshevistic battle cry of soak the rich'! after	an unspeakable siege lasting the better part of two months it was	announced that the studio owed the government a tax debt in excess	of eight million dollars while i who had always remained aloof from	such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned	and the little i legally inherited as morris' helpless relict	was stung with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions	as to wipe out all but a fraction of my poor hard-come-by savings	0.20124717349522497
19274. i was also publicly reprimanded dragged through the mud by the	radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as	the new republic the new yorker time and the christian	science monitor	5804.89118509066
19275. it was then that i availed myself of the	rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional	1729.8799925347437
19276. the	litigation was costly and seemingly endless	141.1813127369118
19277. i fought like a tigress	but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court	mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work	all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest	tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me	5027.381624853457
19278. presidential	coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers toadies	and sycophants of the bench against me but it had been so far-reaching	as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing	me! i was ready like portia to present my own brief	6902.905337433122
19279. but the	supreme court wouldn't even hear my case! my plea was unanimously	voted down and thrown out	1574.0203385322907
19280. again my name was on all the	front pages	392.21881674387566
19281. i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter	but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers	and students of jurisprudence	2583.190726868175
19282. as charles evans hughes said	miss poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by	her logic as a litigant	2820.104222773526
19283. albert einstein was quoted as saying:	the workings of the woman's mind amaze me	948.8336358844529
19284. henry ford spoke	of me as utterly astounding	250.79467192465805
19285. heywood broun wrote: belle	poitrine is the most original thinker since caligula and even	fdr had to concede that if the rest of this nation showed	the foresight and patriotism of miss poitrine america would rapidly	resemble ancient babylon and nineveh	4317.056967948215
19286. not only were	the court costs prohibitive but i was subjected to crippling fines	in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid debts which the governmen	claimed that metronome and i owed- a severe financial blow	5760.243475037788
19287. nor as manny said had the notoriety done my career any good	644.7179615104599
19288. my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges	as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor!	traitor indeed! i point now with pride to the fact that long ere	the committee on un-american activities the minute women the	economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations	were so much as heard of i was hollywood's leading bulwark against	communism fighting single-handedly creeping socialism against	such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra	pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twenty-two	million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through	the transparent ruse of regular relief checks	0.30166232349522504
19289. needless	to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period	497.78489402669345
19290. could	it do otherwise	4.432225193789817
19291. even though i have always had a genius for	throwing myself into every role and playing it for all it's	worth no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune	her reputation her livelihood her home and her nation itself are	all imperilled	4753.361048367221
19292. such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to	oscar winning performances	558.398149123979
19293. i tried my hardest with little help	may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside	pressures were too severe	2452.6852348909165
19294. having	achieved stardom a fortune and a world-renowned	wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch	proceeded to neglect them all	4281.054580237783
19295. never a quick study he now	made no attempt to learn his lines and many a mile of film was	wasted many a scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow	thespians- was taken thirty forty fifty times because miss poitrine's	co-star and helpmate had never learned his part	4963.914039835294
19296. each	time letch went up in his lines i was the one to	be patient helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts	of temperament profanity and abuse blaming others going into sulks	and on more occasions than i care to count storming off the set	for the rest of the day	7611.243852918621
19297. as for his finances i was never privileged	to know exactly how much money letch had salted away	1565.8547265308575
19298. it was i who paid for our little home the food the liquor the servants-	even letch's bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic	club	4306.308037641584
19299. never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third	anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw	1880.828898582849
19300. as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking	gaming and carousing	1401.0556250321401
19301. more than once i was confronted by professional	gamblers bookies loan sharks gangsters thugs	and finger men- people of a class i did not even know existed-	to repay my husband's staggering losses or else h i	shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with	such a sinister milieu	5189.637986979467
19302. and at three different times during our	turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned	to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children!	having the deepest of maternal instincts my heart fairly bled when	i thought of the darling pink and white bundles from heaven i	would have proudly given my husband	8038.081033150198
19303. ah you're too old was	invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested starting	a family	1412.1492302473312
19304. letch had made it abundantly clear that he did	not care for the company of my own precious daughter	2579.725358032737
19305. i now felt it wiser	to keep baby-dear in school and- during the summers- at a camp	run by the society of friends all year around	2725.8799449975554
19306. her presence only	made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau	belletch i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear	so there was no place to put her anyhow	5649.687829288005
19307. in his infinite wisdom wants us to have these inexplicable little	yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say	2166.9006478936767
19308. with	faint	heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau	belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse	3698.6756937495156
19309. the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliated by him- lovely	dinner parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postponed	and postponed and postponed only to be served dry and overcooked	at a table where the host's chair was vacant; a splash party	at the new pool which i had built in the hope of keeping letch	away from public beaches when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed	underwater together for the better part of an hour; a lovely epiphany	party at errol flynn's on which sacred occasion letch stole	away with an unknown starlet leaving me high and dry to	get home as best i could	0.20124717349522497
19310. these are but a sampling of the insults i	endured	560.8335053885675
19311. as mrs letch feeley was it any wonder that i once	the social arbiter of filmdom was excluded from the smart entertainments	given by the astaires the coopers the gables the colmans	the rathbones the taylors the thalbergs and such devout closely	knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys	4979.953484469169
19312. as letch's	antisocial conduct increased our invitations decreased and my heart	was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable screenland	gathering	3686.1488582147163
19313. between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten	films together each less successful both artistically and commercially	than the one before it	2316.9732070544123
19314. our last joint venture sainted lady	a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini and	timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification	of america's first saint in november 1938 was a fiasco from start	to finish	6683.71711017205
19315. as i was playing mother cabrini the picture was actually	all mine with nearly every scene built around me	1723.3121228934147
19316. but in	order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble i wrote	in a part especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who sees	the light and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini	6435.661461194037
19317. and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf	262.1338878593309
19318. did he trouble to	memorize the very small part which i had tailor-made to his specifications	a role eventually cut down to three short speeches	3888.221907918466
19319. did	he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand- the consideration	of arriving at the studio punctually- or even at all	2321.6658527847294
19320. he	did not! the shooting went on for eight months! most	of our working days were spent on the telephone calling bookies	illegal gambling dens a certain residential club for young actresses	more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the	athletic club	7046.367027295497
19321. whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was hung	over uncooperative rude and insulting	1257.2489277567968
19322. he made many tasteless	irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title	role but about religion in general	3044.1264690103167
19323. by the time the film was released	we were three million dollars over-spent war was imminent and the	public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini	2731.797463700043
19324. thanks to	letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me the notices	were few and unfavorable	2360.798856225538
19325. only george santayana seemed to understand	and appreciate the film when he wrote: miss poitrine has perpetrated	the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed	by hollywood	3108.124543597272
19326. but it was small consolation	22.090347286328864
19327. in a rare	fit of anger and spite i farmed out my own husband to a small	and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment	3226.335800649183
19328. the film was called the	diet of worms which i felt was just what letch deserved	1864.5688542532778
19329. it	turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things! it was	a disaster! in clothes letch simply did not project	2441.2466042181536
19330. he was laughed	off the screen	65.95331735286369
19331. at the same time however i availed myself of the	services of that great english actor and master of make-up sir gauntley	pratt to do a quickie called the mystery of the mad	marquess in which i played a young american girl who inherits	a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages	and sliding panels and unbeknownst to anyone is still occupied	by an eccentric maniac	0.20124717349522497
19332. it was a potboiler made on a shoestring	and not the sort of film i like as all i had to do was look	blank and scream a great deal	4861.151198008893
19333. my heart was not in it but oddly	enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career	1718.6337900974522
19334. letch had	returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than	before	1181.7153154560135
19335. i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve	our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person	letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy	advice would help me	4274.634708896078
19336. if i could only think of something	at the studio near me to absorb his boundless energy i said	2586.954344278922
19337. what is letch interested in	14.784087782939782
19338. bookies booze and	babes momma said bluntly	139.99439532873032
19339. her reply stung me but this	was too important to let my hurt make any difference	1243.6476489494448
19340. i can't turn	the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon i said	1424.0732523261916
19341. up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess	he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond	in the neighborhood he hadn't found it	3656.7041400770163
19342. it wasn't his fault	that these things were so	391.0282706823258
19343. the difficulty was that each day seemed	to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately	1710.6808650278442
19344. as a result life had become a kind of continuous make-ready	752.5472456435884
19345. once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention	he could undertake the things which really counted	1879.6512800354726
19346. then at last	his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to	read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon	accompanied by his dogs	5506.626020584041
19347. his dogs	0.20041515
19348. he had almost forgotten	them although they had played such an important part in his early	dreams	2111.325340166789
19349. then they had always been romping around him on these walks	yelping with delight dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting	expeditions returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws	3584.767695845979
19350. dogs did something to one's ego	64.88425311367618
19351. they were constantly assuring	you that you were one of the world's great guys	945.2209055994456
19352. regardless of how	much of a slob you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would	never find out- and even if they did it would make no difference	4998.652703276597
19353. now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs	in the picture	1089.0926900933548
19354. what in the world were you going to do with a lot	of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons	3265.0147285074077
19355. you certainly	couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm	them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused	that they would have nervous breakdowns	3763.695769517618
19356. why in the world couldn't	he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to	1888.4517805120347
19357. it	worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course	of a day	1413.6856399477006
19358. he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about	it	1413.5634727391607
19359. how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business	raise a family be on half a dozen boards work actively on committees	and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents	of a bulging brief case	4552.030706989751
19360. was it possible that as people grow	older the nature of time changed	1182.4678619705528
19361. could it be that it speeded up for	the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were skipping	through the end of the chapter just to get it over with	3548.970476015652
19362. or was	the answer less metaphysical	64.78807012350315
19363. did older people work more slowly	43.94280126194103
19364. did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter shave clean	out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty	3885.070617998647
19365. did men become	perfectionists as they grew older polishing polishing reluctant to	let go	941.9029540244012
19366. it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion	to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully	motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent	to blink their eyes	5496.780389957648
19367. perhaps it was his misfortune or good fortune	whichever way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he	was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded	none which was positively antagonistic to it	4289.656348765137
19368. and then	again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the	things he had planned to do after retirement: reading roaming gardening	lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because	he didn't want to do them	6902.307643329608
19369. there was no compulsion behind them	43.2930551251371
19370. they	could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn	1185.7391359130393
19371. during	all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done	1108.4491894764926
19372. this	habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do	anything for which no one was waiting	3268.381526431942
19373. he looked at the luminous	dial of his wrist watch	373.0530826156584
19374. it was five minutes after four	65.37204605870089
19375. on some	distant farm a rooster crowed and far down the valley an associate answered	1105.1131649317713
19376. he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head	against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn	2365.0591589691435
19377. at least	he could buy the equipment for his workshop	374.6311111878182
19378. thus committed action	might follow	22.05952807338476
19379. he went down to mills and bradley's hardware store	and bought a full set of carpenter's tools including a rotary	power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr mills	said were essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they	were	4375.851842554081
19380. he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools	and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nails	levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he	had	no idea how to use or what they were for	7129.811235987817
19381. that'll get you started	2.943241715662239
19382. best not to get everything	at once	139.64048170404342
19383. add things as you find you need 'em	167.84694692097946
19384. he didn't	even ask the cost of this collection	389.6966487206083
19385. after all if you were going	to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that	was that	2174.253271485308
19386. when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools	jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using	the recently purchased second car	4481.621245460141
19387. it gave him a chance	to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage	of acid comments	2175.710176460528
19388. he had made such a fuss about buying that second car	that he knew he was vulnerable	2118.4448233499693
19389. he piled everything neatly in	a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall	1731.1010673594465
19390. that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand	tools	1652.3380116721157
19391. in front of it would be his workbench	166.97047164340324
19392. the old nightmare	which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him	once more only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill	and	send it away	5332.203572782291
19393. how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall	790.2141618000521
19394. how did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter	958.6149591242868
19395. after the pegboard there would be the paneling	167.3883010126107
19396. he sat down on an	old box and focused on the problem	971.0323968015991
19397. perhaps one bored holes in the stone	with some kind of an electric gadget	940.8042717251441
19398. but then when you stuck things	into the holes why didn't they come right out again	1882.3459505923431
19399. it all	seemed rather hopeless	14.649926186659641
19400. he turned his attention to the workbench	140.7238742638946
19401. perhaps that was the first thing to do	168.27434500626924
19402. a workbench had a heavy	top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top	so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately	collapse when you leaned on it	6218.186431750653
19403. mr mills had done	some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of	boards and two-by-fours which properly handled would he had assured	him turn into a workbench	3580.1772472230646
19404. they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly	pile	568.9032702311463
19405. mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot	259.60277666341415
19406. how could	anyone know what to do with an assortment like that	963.7711847892979
19407. perhaps he	had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench-	someone who knew what he was about	2319.634821288871
19408. then at least he would	have a place to hang his tools and something to work on	2131.8206289144946
19409. after that	everything should be simpler	43.715045536870875
19410. he went upstairs to phone crumb	65.13409522060859
19411. to his amazement he reached him	43.48218228333285
19412. mr crumb was laid up with a	bad cold	391.94876903211
19413. he didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone	wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable	equally lightly	3100.947904027206
19414. the only trouble was that he himself was tied	up on the school job	1401.875762020483
19415. that was why he hadn't been able to finish	the porch	500.7297261080322
19416. no he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter	140.18615354788187
19417. there	wasn't any such thing any more	93.5855365426628
19418. carpenters all wanted steady work and	at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could	hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school	job	5012.7548191483165
19419. there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way	262.56365161657703
19420. nobody	liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going	to be taken drunk	2351.4798446096293
19421. mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting	the next night	646.831620955398
19422. if he was sober which was doubtful he'd have	him get in touch with mr crombie	1880.5828933430803
19423. mr blatz had been	at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to	be the greatest boon that had come into mr crombie's life since	he moved to highfield in spite of the fact that he didn't work very	fast or very long at a time and he didn't like to work at all unless	mr crombie hung around and talked to him	5837.3682832383
19424. he said he was the lonely	type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of	the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you	4861.245258455593
19425. so mr crombie	sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr blatz's	mind from funny things	1889.462749569199
19426. at the same time he watched carefully to see	how one attached pegboards to stone walls but mr blatz was usually	standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he	didn't like to disclose his ignorance	6415.265796905717
19427. while mr blatz	was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie	told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar	2858.393075794863
19428. mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty	249.80820760938596
19429. without further discussion	he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over	the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling which he	then stained and waxed according to his taste	3867.6536710803507
19430. now he said	we got to put in some outlets for them power tools; then a couple	of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about	through down here	4998.79833054384
19431. it all did look very efficient and	shipshape	167.91665649982173
19432. there was no question of that	64.4209704371298
19433. by the way said mr	blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools	needs extra voltage	1732.3098779844797
19434. i guess you know about that	65.26315791147466
19435. before you use	'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need	a new fuse box for the extra circuits	2599.0479784193485
19436. that ain't too bad 'ceptin'	the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do	nothin'	2366.1717074856842
19437. instead of being depressed by this news mr	crombie was actually relieved	636.7971243290569
19438. at least the moment was postponed when	he had to face the mystery of the power tools	2116.7669774048936
19439. he followed mr	blatz up the cellar stairs	168.12922928193956
19440. as usual mrs crombie was standing	in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils	1641.852801093278
19441. mr blatz sat down	in the only unoccupied kitchen chair	376.1906077431359

19446. mr crombie	couldn't remember his saying any such thing	389.1747886448693
19447. oh that's	wonderful cried mrs crombie	43.754128638152224
19448. i have a thousand things	for you to do	394.6743723147017
19449. doors that won't open and doors that won't close	and shelves and broken h   but those are the things i built	the workshop for protested mr crombie	2873.2033602206598

19451. i've	been waiting to get these things done for months she said	640.0262967921828
19452. we	won't live long enough if i wait for you besides which you don't	need to worry- there'll be plenty more	3050.919694767616
19453. but the discussion was	academic	14.868715252752697
19454. mr blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf	above the kitchen sink	1183.1313594580674

19458. richard brinsley sheridan said i think the	interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two	2123.706479305932
19459. and a witty	american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more	true today many a writer seems to think he is never profound except	when he can't understand his own meaning	3681.472334608551
19460. there are many	types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians	under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies	3698.060869278547
19461. in common parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters	misunderstanders misdirectors and kindred misdeeds	1099.3844463788175
19462. one species	of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition	563.2047088207325

19464. another woman addressing christmas	cards said to her husband: we sent them one last year but	they didn't send us one so they probably won't send us one this	year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't	last year don't you think or shall we	7320.8638586790885
19465. such ambiguous	exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and	they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours	2176.401736392892
19466. ambiguity	of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself	in	1184.5246608453251

19471. mr jones	you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted	the contradiction of your original statement	2020.9720254365889

19479. it	took me five hours to write it that way	370.9775159871141
19480. the misplaced	modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity	than in the breach	2125.19200652756
19481. this creates an amusing effect because its	position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word	1877.3956693740881
19482. a verse	familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain: i saw a man once	beat	his wife when on a drunken spree	3269.0333436833835

19506. the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the	anatomical	566.544369589491

19525. that's silly- lemon in mouth she said	93.50729544972391
19526. but since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most	fashionable dinners the girl reluctantly agreed	2822.6286637608855

19585. my	husband is in great pain	43.422252591931226
19586. i called the other afternoon on my old friend graves moreland	the anglo-american literary critic- his mother was born in	ohio- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the upson downs	raising hell and peacocks the former only when the venerable gentleman	becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something	else that is dwindling and diminishing such as human stature hope	and humor	8841.659618180385
19587. my unscientific friend does not believe that human	stature is measurable in terms of speed momentum weightlessness or	distance from earth but is a matter of the development of the human	mind	3444.6966153013514
19588. after gagarin became the greatest man in the world for a	nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism	moreland wrote me a letter in which he said: i am not interested	in how long a bee can live in a vacuum or how far it can fly	7700.773629693237
19589. a	bee's place is in the hive	94.09075243680942
19590. i have come to talk with	you about the future of humor and comedy i told him at which he	started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling	hand	5487.293222046492
19591. i seem to remember he said that in an interview	ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live	2191.1151999860804
19592. did	you go to their funeral	65.0341386812142
19593. i was wrong i admitted	14.835164329477896
19594. comedy didn't die it just went crazy	140.85477319054053
19595. it has identified itself	with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate	1410.2962405716698
19596. we	now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace	but we also have horror jokes magazines known as horror comics	and sick comedians	4645.745232604998
19597. there are even publications called sick and	mad	166.8291917107766
19598. the zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a march	hare; it is manic as a man	2845.8611285319807
19599. i woke up this morning	moreland said paraphrasing lewis carroll	372.5826982686521
19600. do you want to hear	the paraphrase	140.66933599922254
19601. can i bear it	2.934656529649969
19602. i asked taking	a final gulp of my drink and handing him the empty glass	1652.288500143973
19603. just barely he said and repeated his paraphrase: the	time has come the walrus said to speak of manic things	of shots and shouts and sealing dooms of commoners and kings	3327.7748774678416
19604. moreland fixed us each another drink and said for	god's sake tell me something truly amusing	1879.55506222476
19605. i'll	try i said and sat for a moment thinking	374.16669481473343
19606. oh yes the other	day i reread some of emerson's english traits and there	was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany	more than a hundred years ago	5179.49109315379
19607. in the railway station at berlin	a uniformed attendant was chanting 'foreigners this way! foreigners	this way'! one woman- she could have been either english	or american- went up to him and said 'but you are the foreigners'	4049.5481978373696
19608. i took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my	drink and said i admit that going back to ralph waldo emerson	for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy	6059.328578347113
19609. what's the matter with the music	43.647162588933824
19610. moreland	asked	0.30041514999999996
19611. it doesn't drown out the dialogue i explained	166.98008039727154
19612. let's talk about books moreland said	64.95758950362242
19613. i am told	that in america you have non-books by non-writers brought out by	non-publishers for non-readers	1411.338929565833
19614. is it all non-fiction	4.463010916337562
19615. there	is non-fiction and non non-fiction i said	167.55418941333468
19616. speaking	of nonism: the other day in a story about a sit-down demonstration	the paris herald tribune wrote 'the non-violence became noisier'	3281.5226681246468
19617. and then eichmann was quoted as saying in non-english that	hitler's plan to exterminate the jews was nonsense	1568.8020932305976
19618. if we cannot tell evil horror and insanity from nonsense what is	the future of humor and comedy	2357.4045349045123
19619. moreland asked grimly	0.20041515
19620. they require for existence a brave spirit	and a high heart and where do you find these	2145.1461919976823
19621. in our present era	of science and angst the heart has been downgraded to use one	of our popular retrogressive verbs	2030.844442784181
19622. i know what you mean	moreland sighed	140.45707803589374
19623. last year your tennessee williams told	our dilys powell in a television program that it is the task of the	playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart	3443.4363818893426
19624. like almost everybody else he confused the heart both as organ and	as symbol with the disturbed psyche the deranged glands and the jumpy	central nervous system	4318.544965341659
19625. i'm not pleading for the heart that leaps	up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky or for the heart that with	rapture fills and dances with the daffodils	3216.844651203657
19626. the sentimental pure heart	of galahad is gone with the knightly years but i still believe	in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the	stuff that breaks	5312.422962407196
19627. we no longer have tom moore's	and longfellow's 'heart for any fate' either i said	1093.4571362933173
19628. moore and longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us moreland	said	956.8764325133737
19629. one day our species promises co-existence and the next	day it threatens co-extinction	791.9917253028664
19630. we sat for a while drinking in	silence	249.5368564241528
19631. the heart i said finally is now either in	the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes	1899.7609152998539
19632. when it was worn	in the breast or even on the sleeve we at least knew where it was	2598.6230394872405
19633. there was a long silence	14.820034034376508
19634. you have visited england five	times in the past quarter-century i believe my host said	1640.245702538033
19635. what	has impressed you most on your present visit	261.3758518150991
19636. i	would say depressed not impressed i told him	390.6826457822577
19637. i should say it	is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas	involving clergymen and parishioners psychiatrists and patients	2448.6065331110817
19638. it is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas	from the modern theatre	2132.01808287708
19639. do you think we need a new	henry james to re-explore the anglo-american scene	946.5570953053066
19640. he asked	0.30041514999999996
19641. or perhaps a new noe^l coward	43.15270784949172
19642. but you must have	heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent	years of james and the antic heyday of coward	3686.6271741592595
19643. i myself hear	it said constantly- in drawing-rooms	165.67405223399845
19644. in them there is usually	a group of anglo-americans with tragicomic problems worthy of being	explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire	4650.118386548141
19645. i stood up and began pacing	43.74430787368455
19646. if you are trying to get	us out of the brothel the dustbin the kitchen sink and the tawdry living-room	you are probably wasting your time moreland told me	4632.708150822841
19647. too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that	crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock	2318.1244279685575
19648. furiouser	and furiouser i said	22.171822912217305
19649. i am worried about the current	meanings of the word 'funny'	502.5387078669223
19650. it now means ominous as when one speaks	of a funny sound in the motor; disturbing as when one says that	a friend is acting funny; and frightening as when a wife tells	the police that it is funny but her husband hasn't been home for two	days and nights	7451.909984702803
19651. moreland sat brooding for a full minute	during which i made each of us a new drink	1409.0741274409306
19652. he took his glass clinked	it against mine and said toujours gai what the hell!	borrowing a line from don marquis' mehitabel	3259.0533308074196
19653. be careful	of the word 'gay' for it too has undergone a change	790.7387703759755
19654. it	now means in my country homosexual i said	390.7659720288874
19655. oh i forgot to	say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is	removed to a mental institution in an ambulance	2988.3124434428037
19656. recently by the way	i received a questionnaire in which i was asked whether or not i	was non-institutionalized	2579.5938356497727
19657. my host went over and stared	out the window at his peacocks; then he turned to me	1416.0010881253718
19658. is	it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species	1654.2997870575641
19659. oh that is demonstrable i told him	93.38475768099283
19660. do	you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her	sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously	3479.57802477695
19661. she told the sheep	'the world is coming to an end'! and the sheep said- all	in unison i have no doubt- 'ba-a-a'! the sound mockery of	sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh	3655.1281069116026
19662. that is only partly	non-nonsense he began	141.0225403488433
19663. if you saw the drama called	rhinoceros i said think of the effect it would have on	an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning	into a rhinoceros	3446.58587946914
19664. the rhinos would panic screaming 'help'!-	if that can be screamed in their language	1405.9830677965076
19665. you think	the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy	498.16552493414866
19666. moreland demanded	0.30041514999999996
19667. the political and intellectual	left began fighting humor and comedy years ago because they fear	things they do not understand and cannot manage such as satire and	irony such as	humor and comedy	3575.9176715767803
19668. nevertheless like any other human being	upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually khrushchev	the anti-personality cultist has become a comic actor or thinks	he has	4510.066906348239
19669. in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed	to believe that he was as funny as ed wynn	2327.151136557799
19670. but like caesar	he has only one joke so far as i can find out	1658.3823044604633
19671. it consists in saying	'that would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage'	1103.1782430687556
19672. why	in the name of his non-god doesn't he vary it a bit	1182.7272636676344
19673. such as	0.20041515
19674. moreland asked	0.30041514999999996
19675. such as 'sending the	cat to guard the mice' or 'the falcon to protect the dove' or	most terribly sharp of all 'the human being to save humanity'	2985.8816740538596
19676. you and i have fallen out of literature into politics	moreland observed	955.9716358825171
19677. what a nasty fall was there! i	said	165.98318501103816
19678. moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again and then	came back and sat down restively	2120.527897424907
19679. the world that was once foot-loose	and fancy-free he said has now become screw-loose and	frenzy-free	1262.8069131960694
19680. in our age of science and angst it seems to me more	brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the	sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space	5620.884295434263
19681. the human	ego being what it is i put in science fiction has always assumed	that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems	than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats	3849.3566864039844
19682. it seems	to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may	well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species	4661.397807719032
19683. now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again moreland protested	502.07124162078827
19684. not in the largest sense of the words i said	564.3713570618124
19685. the other day arnold toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency	of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions its	ideologies and its virtually everything else	2974.9482020914215
19686. why do we not realize	that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something	else	2575.7333899394976
19687. forty years ago an english writer w l george	dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example	that 'saint george for merry england' would not start	a spirit half so quickly as 'strike frog-eating frenchmen dead'!	there was also gott strafe angleterre moreland	reminded me and carthago delenda est or if you will deus	strafe carthage	5653.368165240537
19688. it isn't what the ideologist believes in	but what he hates that puts the world in jeopardy	2112.153362034279
19689. this is the force	in our time and in every other time that urges the paranoiac and the	manic-depressive to become head of a state	2601.969596344351
19690. complete power not only	corrupts but it also attracts the mad	752.3879686883809
19691. there is a bitter satire for	a future writer in that	501.25703180536823
19692. great satire has always been clearly	written and readily understandable i said	958.8338626544813
19693. but we now	find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers	and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry	and non-poetry	2980.732252680635
19694. i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules	of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of	what the story is about	4990.015328336973
19695. one day the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's	horse	792.6378002043817
19696. they wanted to see what his back felt like- the general's	757.4659830218345
19697. he looked so comfortable being straight	43.68612844899553
19698. they wanted to touch	the mystery	65.55393495177147
19699. arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came	by	373.31530352076123
19700. arlene had a hard voice too this	time	249.32673965632398
19701. the policeman's eyes rather popped for a second; but then	arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasn't	for these dear children-	2852.384281335353
19702. the policeman got a confused	funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now	look here lady: i know you got to entertain these kids and all	5040.412440682181
19703. but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues	cannot be crawled on	1575.6374701192822
19704. arlene was so ashamed that she hung	her head when she said yes sir	1406.965486793451
19705. the policeman walked	on but he looked back once	262.85354618977226
19706. that had happened on the day when	two	other unusual things had occurred	1190.8723676528866
19707. arlene had taught them a new way	to have fun in their little private area; and they had told their	mother about the tumbles	2455.144421627195
19708. in matters of exact information that kept	her one step behind developments; and so they were consistently true	to their principles	3034.349874372868
19709. never mind arlene had said after	the policeman had left having pursued the usual unco-operative course	of grownups	1578.5917770256406
19710. i know something that is much more fun	that we can do on our little lawn	1880.8131472399236
19711. what is it	0.20041515
19712. asked	the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably	normal and predictable	1418.2802663842406
19713. maybe that was why they were cordial and	loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene	933.6440358336931
19714. just you wait	advised arlene echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie	1180.515236500878
19715. and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most	twirlingly magnificent time	1422.473785505578
19716. first arlene had put them through	some rapid somersaults	391.64999066771827
19717. they had protested that that wasn't any	surprise	165.1176278945005
19718. just you wait said arlene again as though	she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy	little sturdy statement	3027.08153070752
19719. is it	anything like cooked-over oatmeal	43.70931531218977
19720. asked one of the children	22.378573810390385
19721. not the least bit arlene snapped	42.930367449416515
19722. one of the many things	that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously	particularly your very very serious questions	3883.326108649179
19723. those were	especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest	641.4251882753168
19724. she would	sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously	1648.3933310077452
19725. but not hard for very long	43.49556490950842
19726. just long enough to make you feel important	249.74115143285593
19727. now said arlene eventually making them both	sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided	itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable	3672.821696766653
19728. now	we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make	us think of	1880.4402272533341
19729. the children looked at each other and	sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever	1257.363662125425
19730. their curiosity	went happily out of bounds	139.24584425072428
19731. then arlene threw herself	backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful	935.6959943888135
19732. she held herself	that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked	1647.45906174135
19733. imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part	of that picture frame at home one of them said	2309.229159269063
19734. they both laughed	and winked back	65.27268819752791
19735. i'm general burnside's horse upside	down arlene said sort of gaspingly for her: even she had	to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position	2842.082115069696
19736. she made general	burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down	1418.1438357245613
19737. then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous	smile		434.6829576364195
19738. and she would wink and throw	kisses	141.32720261668302
19739. they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time	but it made their lips and eyelids tremble	1871.5891140322801
19740. but they kept on	clapping for a long long time	559.3281621472149
19741. this time arlene said	and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking	you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing	3206.2247244907803
19742. it	all has something to do with general burnside and his horse	968.1066570290192
19743. this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was	781.8750365895148
19744. it was general burnside's horse running in a circle	394.28489405361853
19745. his legs	shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to	his shoulders	1572.1350605682542
19746. that's the general's horse one of them cried	out	392.5247929918445
19747. the other remarked in a happy laughter that's	a funny old horse	650.4844484168701
19748. the first one said he sure does shake	250.40148503732416
19749. then there was the general kissing his	wife	168.18302555474605
19750. they had to be told that one	139.9125958795012
19751. but it was even funnier after	they had been told	376.11761647099024
19752. their father when he came back from those many	business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips	and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in	the electric icebox	6085.207060622162
19753. he was the funniest	man	14.740702478430592
19754. he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet	956.8596118141955
19755. then they had to get up and be general burnside	373.87295873667136
19756. all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking	their legs out	1639.2514492804862
19757. then they said general	burnside was going to jump over his horse's head; and they did some	somersaults	1576.6487439428906
19758. but that wasn't very funny either	65.72229501328434
19759. you	ought to shake arlene advised them	92.96904278707305
19760. and arlene showed them how	to begin	139.68724044168266
19761. she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like	my sister kate	1098.903059914341
19762. they were clumsy but they	were beginning to catch on	558.9064664582236
19763. they also caught on a little bit on how to	smile a lot without your lips trembling	1403.7590837554756
19764. imagine you won't get	your allowance if you're caught not smiling- or smiling with your	lips trembling too much arlene suggested	3013.1631116652334
19765. that helped a	great deal	14.913243938569261
19766. they were a little late in getting home	249.12216771737113
19767. i'm	sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could	hardly hear it	1259.292748318966
19768. my mother constituted herself the voice	of all of us	556.5746627294232
19769. it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother	said in a friendly way	500.4088423824116
19770. i suppose you all were playing and forgot	248.76708698833608
19771. yes ma'am the children chorused heartily	44.0529129619354
19772. the children rushed off to	get rid of their sweaters; and arlene began tapping the kitchen door	open	2344.749663159001
19773. arlene's a good girl my uncle remarked to us; but	he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the	door responded	2968.8454667202677
19774. that tap had a slight bangish quality	140.62276767534075
19775. she	really is a dear little thing my mother agreed	373.85786947253075
19776. her upper lip	lifted	slightly	22.49933481197464
19777. she was biting into a small red radish; and that action	always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing	2465.720234723444
19778. also	she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in	a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish	4110.955612178934
19779. she would	try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth	to the place where she was biting	2315.7518682509717
19780. it never worked naturally; but	it made her look unusual	560.3566289685375
19781. also when she had bitten off half of the small	radish she found the suspense unbearable; and she would snatch	the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it	3559.768274246055
19782. one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief	564.5105893097136
19783. actually it	was inaudible to anyone not expecting it	259.0292651118396
19784. but the warm joy of her brown	eyes was open to the general public	1417.0399043100174
19785. later on the children	told her further about somersaulting	261.40241579090684
19786. it must be awfully good	for them	140.39372160368663
19787. and awfully kind of arlene she told us later	257.4715673406914
19788. but	do you know something curious	65.50404383303746
19789. she added	0.20041515
19790. i reached into	that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress	1409.7850190806107
19791. i have no notion	why i reached	93.13845911516762
19792. and i found a radish	22.393929183903705
19793. was it an omen	2.972381443266771
19794. i thought	for a second	22.228390133736614
19795. but i would not pamper myself in that silly way	373.1375000726635
19796. i opened the window and threw the radish out	393.3072988567442
19797. then my mother	blushed at this small lie; for she knew and we knew that it was	cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible	a strain	3337.635152081275
19798. arlene became indispensable; nobody could have	told why	249.69610457132748
19799. it was in the air	14.881287859790087
19800. a friend of my father's	came to dinner	250.20090188061698
19801. he was passing through town and phoned to say	hello	374.8381211533398
19802. as a result he was persuaded out to dinner	387.2016928354778
19803. as a matter of	fact this happened every four or five months	639.6263220497148
19804. sometimes he coincided	with my father's being at home	393.1001098061956
19805. sometimes as at this juncture he	did not	165.33813358090035
19806. but he was always persuaded out	64.57891239769583
19807. he liked children	in a loathsome kind of way; the two youngest in our family always had	to be	brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment	2985.810921207423
19808. when he	had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their	middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely	so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action	not bothering to look	6921.111963718933
19809. the children loathed him too	14.901030193163013
19810. this evening	they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends	of dessert distributed over them	2574.458330363617
19811. there had been some coconut in it	for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit	of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish	with a shiver	4132.361045684987
19812. they were pushed gently into the room by arlene-	whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back	around to the kitchen side of the door	4286.249781001998
19813. we had just sat down	14.866685906867744
19814. tell mr gorboduc what you're doing these days my mother	advised the children ceremonially	1416.7658903742629
19815. there was an air of revolt	about the children- even irreverence for their own principles	1100.9613001138014
19816. this	could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing a	horselike balkiness of demeanor	2128.440758393693
19817. possibly the coconut-containing dessert	had brought up bitter problems of administration	504.14211983322565
19818. but at the beginning	this stayed just in the air	563.640109733963
19819. we go to the park with	this nice lady one of them said	787.446917694695
19820. this happy bulletin convulsed mr gorboduc	65.26298590578692
19821. you do	0.20041515
19822. he asked between wheezes of laughter	65.17098368698647
19823. he was forced to wipe his eyes	94.16207659653695
19824. you don't step on the flowers do you	253.55611352980264
19825. eh	0.20041515
19826. one	of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger	1170.1198939705382
19827. mr gorboduc	took a swig of his sherry	167.17962985700638
19828. he was so long thinking that my mother had	time to inspect her sherry for dregs	1868.9724218568579
19829. usually this was done when	attention was diverted by someone else's long boring story	937.957576928033
19830. but this	time she was nervous: she was open	391.94127696766617
19831. mr gorboduc was finally	in command of his mind again	372.5981119799198
19832. tell me- what do you do at	the park	395.8178178861752
19833. he asked	0.20041515
19834. this was delivered in a forthright way without	coyness and over-pretended interest- an admirable way with children	2124.3295038520546
19835. only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging	insinuation of the direct command	1259.6054804070072
19836. this nettled the children into the	revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority	over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and	illegitimate accomplishment	5001.161167331733
19837. we bump one said; and	the other went on to development of the idea	938.1541234202408
19838. we grind too he	said	22.189643826883902
19839. my mother was beside herself with curiosity	93.35558608547967
19840. say that	again she pleaded	22.239889132265226
19841. she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly	around in her glass	785.1843198550439
19842. you what	0.30041514999999996
19843. she could see that mr	gorboduc was intrigued; the hostess in her took over	937.6600643042399
19844. you what	0.30041514999999996
19845. my uncle looked at mr	gorboduc	43.37074906657135
19846. he read henry james and used to pretend profundity	through eye-beamings at people	1182.117817091012
19847. he	would not look up	14.871615145877973
19848. he was very funny about the whole thing	253.20318488358856
19849. a delightful	vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-punic war rome	636.1595110563587
19850. marcellus the hero is beset from all sides by the problems of	approaching manhood	1405.5450986065553
19851. the story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday	as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow	2313.1240497913586
19852. suddenly a messenger arrives and just before collapsing dead	at his feet informs him that the saracens have invaded silesia the	home province of his affianced	4098.959581197808
19853. he at once cancels the celebrations	and buckling on his scimitar stumbles blindly from the house where	he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart	2748.2598879724173
19854. the albany civic	opera's presentation of spumoni's immortal il sevigli	del spegititgninino with guest contralto hattie sforzt	2116.375911296972
19855. an	unusual if not extraordinary rendering of the classic myth that involves	the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the us cavalry	was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather conduit	company amid cheers of hubba hubba and yalagaloo pip pip!	after a busy overture the curtain rises on a farm	scene- the ranavan valley in northern maine	5634.595369810746
19856. a dead armadillo	the sole occupant of the stage symbolizes the crisis and destruction	of the old order	2364.6603503599185
19857. old order acted and atonally sung by grunnfeu	arapacis the lovely serbantian import then entered and delivered	the well-known invocation to the god phineoppus whereupon the stage	is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering gorshek priests	symbolizing love lust prudence and general motors respectively	4696.939324139599
19858. according to the myth old order then vanishes at stage left	and reappears at extreme stage right but director shuz skillfully sidesteps	the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having	miss arapacis walk across the stage	6049.619795093012
19859. the night we saw it a rather	unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the	armadillo complaining- in ad-lib- that it smelled	2458.9587944951268
19860. we caught	the early train to new york	248.49961938680525
19861. a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian	proto-senility cults	788.6067565294039
19862. it's somewhat off the beaten track to	be sure but therein lies its variety and charm	1883.706741348028
19863. for example probably	very few people know that the word visrhanik that is bantered	about so much today stems from the verb bouanahsha: to salivate	2613.9164262521554
19864. likewise and equally fascinating is the news that such unlikely	synonyms as pratakku sweathruna and the tongue-twister	nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen	all originated in the same	village in bathar-on-walli	province and are all used to express	sentiments concerning british imperialism	5934.919821387117
19865. the terms are fairly	safe to use on this side of the ocean but before you start spouting	them to your date it might be best to find out if he was a member of	major pockmanster's delhi regiment since resentment toward the	natives was reportedly very high in that outfit	4992.810889115702
19866. the	breeze and chancellor neitzbohr a movie melodrama that concerns	the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of	the apollo belvedere	4096.927005486147
19867. as you have doubtless guessed already the plot	is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory	1264.4498328956997
19868. for	example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to	a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon	subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool	was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was	doris		6006.822784504661
19869. for the remainder of the movie chancellor	neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian	blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag	3109.0500802433717
19870. in this manner	he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his	personal assaults against the english at dunkirk	3697.9211831875064
19871. as we find out	at the end it is not the stool	that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind	2164.768393231122
19872. and when	the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the	while muttering he loves me he loves me not	3487.90287236523
19873. after a few tortuous	moments of wondering who he is the camera pans across the	room to the plaster statue and we realize that neitzbohr is trying	to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture	4129.773823460129
19874. the effect	needless to say is almost terrifying and though at times a bit obscure	the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the repressed	movie-goer	4095.1204294957474
19875. the music of bini salfininistas	capital lp 63711-r one of the rare recordings of this	titanic	yet unsung composer	1724.223330857083
19876. those persons who were lucky enough to see	and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival	in august 1916 will certainly welcome his return to public notice;	and it is not unlikely that even as the great bach lay dormant	for so many years so has the erudite ingenious salfininistas passed	through his purgatory of neglect	8202.306124864102
19877. but now under the guidance	of the contemporary composer marc schlek jr a major revival	is under way	1577.3498823671139
19878. as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra schlek	gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and	rattzhenfuut concertos including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza	which was included at the conductor's insistence	5202.277883407939
19879. a major portion	of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of	the almost impossible indianapolis movement in the baslot	2460.741230993529
19880. not	only was haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed	to take every tonal eccentricity in stride	2580.332039697592
19881. for example to move	from the lowest f-major register up to a	barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same	time even one of the 407 fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider	and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent	throughout the passage	5095.624140545924
19882. we would have preferred however to have had	the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots	on the recording since it mars an otherwise sober if not lofty	performance	5496.067280110324
19883. as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite heavy-handed	commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas	the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance	in that nebulous area known as off-broadway	3567.032444678326
19884. for the last two	years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called	non-dramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on	the psyche of this veteran theatregoer	4828.372518224331
19885. the latest and significantly	greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of	basho's classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle a former university	of maryland chemistry instructor	2989.793737042152
19886. although the play does show	a certain structural amateurishness	the statement	it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound	and worthy of our attention	4486.208594316393
19887. the action centers about a group	of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria	and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot	coffee	3350.8630684650516
19888. they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress	the police and an intruding government tutor	2130.1178369125705
19889. the innocence that	they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when	one of them asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie gets a plate	of english muffins instead	3438.504735060532
19890. leaving the theatre after the performance	i had a flash of intuition that life after all	is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this	unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest	thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired	7540.918086334168
19891. aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible	francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris	again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious	interlude the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls	hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel	4700.3977435257875
19892. a biting pithy	parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life the piece	has been set by mlle	lagoon to a sumptuous score	by existentialist hot-shot	jean-paul sartre	4464.475410984881
19893. petite lovely yvette chadroe plays the	nymphomaniac engagingly	168.3515455215035
19894. ever since bambi and more recently	born free there have been a lot of books about animals	but few compare with max fink's wry understated charming and immensely	readable my friend the quizzical salamander	5476.466380398466
19895. done in	the modern style of a confession fink tells in exquisite detail	how he came to know and more important love his mother's pet salamander	alicia	2852.4815028612948
19896. it is not an entirely happy book as mrs fink	soon becomes jealous of alicia and in retaliation refuses to continue	to scrape the algae off her glass	4455.960428025624
19897. max in a fit of despair takes	alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank		at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson's disease	and dies	3108.2963978292987
19898. this brief resume hardly does the book justice but	i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major	problems of our time	4077.5743817330776
19899. opera in the grand tradition along	with mah-jongg seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback	1099.3714494279334
19900. in this	country the two guiding lights are without doubt felix fing and	anna pulova	1647.2738411253426
19901. fing a lean chiseled impeccable gentleman of the old	school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke	is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi's earliest most raucous	opera nabisco	a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting	leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno	version of volare	5147.078021715179
19902. miss pulova has a voice that maria callas	once described as like chipping teeth with a screw driver	and her round opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the	emotions demanded by the role of rosalie	5653.637195507866
19903. the champs elysees	is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of france's	beat-up beatnik jeunes filles	1567.6086583023618
19904. cause of all this commotion:	squat pug-nosed balding hopelessly ugly jean-pierre bravado	a bogartian figure who plays a sadistic amoral philosophic tasti-freeze	salesman in old new-waver fredrico de mille rossilini's	endlessly provocative film a sour sponge	5792.537492207662
19905. bravado has been	alternately described as a symbol of the new grandeur of france and	myself	and a decadent disgusting slob!	but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity	whenever he is on it	3976.2986270499764
19906. soaring to stardom along with him margo	felicity brighetti a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian	starlet turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic	3913.672714275298
19907. the battle of the drib-drool continues but most of new york's	knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their	feet impatiently in expectation of v day	september first when augustus quasimodo's first one-man show opens	at the guggenheim	4036.155253249537
19908. we have heard that after seeing mr quasimodo's	work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity	and importance of the whole abstract movement	4075.616136764369
19909. and it is thought	by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination	of a school that started with monet progressed through kandinsky	and the cubist picasso and blossomed just recently in pollock	and de kooning	4223.831586420407
19910. quasimodo defines his own art as the search	for what is not there	1184.1970560806683
19911. i paint the nothing he said	once to franz kline and myself the nothing that is behind the something	the inexpressible unpaintable 'tick' in the unconscious	the 'spirit' of the moment resting forever suspended like a huge	balloon in non-time	4229.673514665962
19912. it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence	to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him	to paint such pictures as the invasion of cuba	3890.536674555637
19913. in this work	his use of non-color is startling and skillful	504.63620691994146
19914. the sweep of space	the delicate counterbalance of the white masses the over-all completeness	and unity the originality and imagination all entitle it to be	called an authentic masterpiece	4658.353194275343
19915. i asked quasimodo recently how he	accomplished this and he replied that he had painted his model a beautiful	shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas which	was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity	4524.235483916327
19916. dear sirs: let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception	in your minds wherever you are	2110.0234709567585
19917. the collective by which i	address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but	an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves	2727.830975043313
19918. it is i	am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage	in your particular branch of the boost; ie burglars who	rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hot-slough prowlers	those who work while the occupants are home	6780.625588079139
19919. since the latter obviously	require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that	i am taunting you as socially inferior	2332.6663618082216
19920. far from it; i merely	draw an etymological distinction hoping that specialists and busy people	like you will welcome such precision in a layman	3717.3252280301967
19921. above all disabuse	yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation	at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets	d'art or to shame you into rectitude	3741.496341232236
19922. my object rather is to	alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest	implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might	inflict	5027.681538832896
19923. you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign so vindictive	that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about	them	2583.213200632898
19924. quite candidly fellows i wouldn't be in your shoes for	all the rice in china	1639.9321817634668
19925. as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances	in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate	them briefly	1729.4030714831738
19926. sometime on saturday evening august 22nd	while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell' orso in	rome you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county pennsylvania	and let yourselves into the premises	5919.715281789415
19927. hastening to the attic the	temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded	to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants	and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored	there	4388.0166027186215
19928. what you were looking for	eludes me but to judge from	phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola you danced	two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating	in that milieu	5635.263706316438
19929. you then descended one story glommed a television	set from the music room- the only constructive feature of your visit	by the way- and returning to the ground floor entered the master	bedroom	3575.198142744053
19930. from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus	beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures	of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jade-handled	magnifying glass	5367.961535149805
19931. rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you	unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood which	along with two box kodaks you added to your haul	3110.317875676298
19932. then having	wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out	the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover	4286.666683885674
19933. so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you i'm	sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake	2461.2474530165055
19934. the foregoing aided by several clues i'll withhold to keep you	on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector	javert but before they close in gird yourselves i repeat for a vengeance	infinitely more pitiless	6174.5408680159435
19935. fourteen of the sculptures you took	posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will	observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in	patches	3466.436735930526
19936. in time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce	riddling	you with frambesia the king's evil sheep rot and clonic	spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for	release	5465.358226470934
19937. all this though is simply a prelude a curtain-raiser	for what ensues and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately	forecast it	2180.173621458914
19938. if however it would help to intensify your anguish	i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted	and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance	5326.334641059022
19939. first of all the six figures of the buddha	you heisted- four siamese heads a black obsidian statuette in the	earth-touching position and a large brass figure of the dying buddha	on a teakwood base	3758.365842999233
19940. now you probably share the widespread western	belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods	much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest	4659.497536153286
19941. 'fess up- don't	you	2.977635447596268
19942. well ordinarily he is except	toward impious folk who steal disturb or maltreat the	presence	1654.0404246581293
19943. very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such	jokers	259.4760494264043
19944. eight or ten years ago a couple of french hoods stole a priceless	khmer head from the musee guimet in paris and a week later	crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy	5500.276348282225
19945. hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate	their	torment; they expired amid indescribable fantods imploring the blessed	one to forgive their desecration	2592.4558133591117
19946. any reputable french interne	can supply you with a dozen similar instances and i'll presently	recount a case out of my own personal experience but for the moment	let's resume our catalogue	5162.8030403211105
19947. whether the pair of sudanese	ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers	to lead as a dealer in khartoum assured me i am not competent to	say	3451.621914907976
19948. likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a doctor	lady; a friend of mine removing her from the	curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer but he had	previously drunk a quantity of applejack	6227.9636679490595
19949. the three indian brass deities	though- ganessa siva and krishna- are an altogether different	cup of tea	1416.032492740464
19950. they hail from travancore a state in the subcontinent	where kali the goddess of death is worshiped	2128.876092188905
19951. have you ever	heard of thuggee	43.15942690114623
19952. nuf sed h	0.30041514999999996
19953. but it is the wooden sculpture from	bali the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and	their bodies interlaced by a fish that i particularly call to your	attention	3452.6742673411886
19954. oddly enough this is an amulet against housebreakers presented	to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949	2815.4581234629936
19955. inscribed around	its base is a charm in balinese a dialect i take it you don't	comprehend	1426.233054363224
19956. neither do i but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough	to translate and i'll do as much for you	2588.0030673254996
19957. whosoever violates our	rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow	502.9743770674183
19958. the teeth	will rain from his mouth like pebbles his wife will make him cocu	with fishmongers and a trolley car will grow in his stomach	4108.127666666732
19959. furthermore-	and this to me strikes an especially warming note- it shall	avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot	2457.5899301265144
19960. the	cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours	and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation	2817.211976359937
19961. sort of remorseless	isn't it	14.839116502654562
19962. still there it is	4.4482296205881156
19963. now you no doubt regard	the preceding as pap; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot	rods gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns	and generally behaving like u^bermenschen	3652.4833883019346
19964. in that case listen	to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss	1392.6806539572403
19965. a couple	of years back i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase	contained the type of niche called a coffin turn	2191.318793101325
19966. in it was	a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay and occasionally	to make merit my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a	few pennies in its lap	5467.471334951076
19967. after a while we became aware that the money	was disappearing as fast as we replenished it	1416.8073932544082
19968. our suspicions eventually	centered by the process of elimination on a grocer's boy a	thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead	3702.0204918028626
19969. the	more i probed into this young man's activities and character the	less savory i found him	1424.1529265675645
19970. i learned for example that he made a practice	of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling	salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet	4659.977502716974
19971. his energy was prodigious;	sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector	and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would	hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar	butts against their paws	4545.378666149923
19972. evenings he was frequently to be seen at restaurants	like enrico + paglieri's or peter's backyard drunkenly	donning ladies' hats and singing o sole mio	2548.4679776174135
19973. in short	and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber	373.90988873800694
19974. well the odious little	toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate	and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself	3478.560255289366
19975. one morning	we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the	idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap	2590.8170710987793

19979. and how right she was	14.796902675629363
19980. the next time we saw him he was a changed person; he had aged	thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with	wrinkles	as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire	5789.053162029473
19981. some sort of	nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice-	either an ape specter or abe spector a process-server we couldn't	determine which	2981.319043514245
19982. his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr	grimesby roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing	the speckled band	3693.0648513553087

19985. reduced to beggary he at last got	a job as office boy to a television producer	1262.4869942028722
19986. his hubris deficiency	of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top	1177.0317932027267
19987. he evolved	programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks	and quickly superseded his boss	1570.3538118737504
19988. not long ago i rode down	with him in an elevator in radio city; he was talking to himself	thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in	extremis	5489.391493677383
19989. see that guy	0.20041515
19990. the operator asked pityingly	4.420236867796885
19991. i	wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china	638.0173870698297
19992. there's	some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps	390.66564169899556
19993. however one	looks at it therefore i'd say that your horoscope for this autumn	is the reverse of rosy	1713.82105787299
19994. the inventory you acquired from me isn't	going to be easy to move; you can't very well sidle up to people	on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot bodhisattva	5485.227896638436
19995. additionally	since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with	sprue yaws delhi boil the granville wilt liver fluke bilharziasis	and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused you	mustn't expect to be lionized socially	4202.234623508306
19996. my advice if you live long	enough to continue your vocation is that the next time you're attracted	by the exotic pass it up- it's nothing but a headache	4641.830110644484
19997. as	you can count on me to do the same	374.6824187222902

19999. she was a living doll and no mistake- the blue-black bang	the wide cheekbones olive-flushed that betrayed the cherokee strain	in her midwestern lineage and the mouth whose only fault in the	novelist's carping phrase was that the lower lip was a trifle too	voluptuous	4610.896160964692
20000. from what i was able to gauge in a swift greedy glance	the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was stupefying	3043.75839143087
