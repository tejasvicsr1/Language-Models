202. karns said it was a wrongful act	for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand	jury room.	11.320710908855997
203. he said this constituted a very serious misuse	of the criminal court processes.	10.44274163931199
204. actually the abuse of the	process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook	county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the	function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east	st louis sitting in cook county court.	8.706393772659274
205. karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35	persons.	8.572618088635073

214. the aged care plan	similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a	fight on capitol hill.	11.40828556132985
215. it was defeated in congress last year.	14.197384083164485
216. up to $37 a year	it would be financed by boosting the social security	payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now	paying such taxes.	8.633625443723854
217. the social security payroll tax is now 6	per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4800	of pay per year.	5.381844759762827
218. the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to	$5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.	9.632272990725319
219. 25 per cent each.	14.415057025359944
220. similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad	retirement system.	8.763921254805737
221. the payroll tax would actually rise	to 7.	9.298071822861187
222. 5 per cent starting jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because	the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date	to pay for other social security costs.	11.724086972764434
223. officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would	amount to 1.	7.427932798131499
224. 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would	run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963.	12.948655445553012
225. both figures would go	higher in later years.	7.8198648035691365
226. other parts of the kennedy health plan	would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over	the next 10 years.	11.05698977027572
227. these would be paid for out of general not payroll	taxes.	9.364784120818051
228. the aged care plan carries these	benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad	retirement systems:  full payment of hospital bills for	stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would	pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.	8.882490086030508
229. full payment	of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from	a hospital.	6.3319829536492005

232. community visiting nurse services at home	for up to 240 days an illness.	8.781102701675984
233. the president noted that congress	last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical	bills of the needy aged.	8.225219447816352
234. he said his	plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish	to receive care at the taxpayers' expense but who are nevertheless	staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-	caused by an extended hospital stay.	8.17207138291555
235. this is a very	modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said	and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any	malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.	6.13768516239566
236. this	is not a program of socialized medicine.	17.34280727165047
237. it is a program of prepayment	of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.	12.105315749551826
238. every	person will choose his own doctor and hospital.	9.062145471664723
239. pay doctors	the plan does not cover doctor bills.	7.4093836999938985
240. they would still	be paid by the patient.	16.00611943115565
241. apart from the aged care plan the president's	most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships	and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.	6.952188582854283
242. the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools	cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need	for health care.	7.82104739251993
243. moreover he said many qualified young people are	not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the	schooling costs.	5.061053932115967
244. the scholarship plan	would	provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal	to $1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.	7.867440141163862
245. the	schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships based on need	of up to $2000 a year per student.	5.768887140097107
246. in addition the government	would pay a $1000 cost of education grant to the schools for	each $1500 in scholarship grants.	7.942125033452331
247. officials estimated the combined	programs would cost	5.	10.023145879298935
248. 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21	millions by 1966.	14.046283259302436
249. the president recommended federal matching	grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing	new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing	ones.	7.983034807831908
250. in the area of community health	services the president called for doubling the present 10 million	dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.	11.156313204506853
251. he asked	for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory	grants to states to improve nursing homes.	7.348825343770686
252. he further	proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.	11.047042261077605

258. the president	said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540	million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research	in medicine.	7.517225843462231
259. the president said his proposals combine the indispensable	elements in a sound health program- people knowledge	services facilities and the means to pay for them.	7.298993155133992
260. as expected	congressional reaction to the message was along expected	lines.	13.493044904391322
261. legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under	the social security system criticized the president's plan.	4.202920242740542
262. those	who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.	9.51544179649594
263. senate	republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader	charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them	to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.	5.605288563662773
264. halleck	said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair	trial first.	9.511071928414644
265. house speaker sam rayburn d tex	called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction	on its fate in the house.	6.16446491601519
266. acting hastily under white house pressure	the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nation's	federal housing chief.	6.9467468041329505
267. only 11 senators were on the floor	and there was no record vote.	8.781634004314242
268. a number of scattered ayes and	noes was heard.	13.724842970509414
269. customary senate rules were ignored in	order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing	and home finance agency.	6.31308302598485
270. in the last eight years all	presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been	denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least	a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.	9.730103570982621
271. the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d	ore in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet	selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961.	5.055966847548529
272. the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting	of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been	the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual	understanding than in past meetings.	7.43980753714733
273. this has been a working	session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed	along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.	8.047921195869552
274. in oslo	the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine	attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.	9.300019578529833
275. this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable	where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers	and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems.	8.274179817231179
276. the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated	by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other	allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances	that have brought these troubles about has been conspicious by	its absence.	7.559406268489103
277. in the case of portugal which	a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council	should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been	a noticeable relaxation of tension.	8.199475451092024
278. the general remarkably courteous	explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been	no explosion in the council.	11.026716886832876
279. there should even be no more bitter surprises	in the un general assembly as to nato members' votes	since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that	in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance.	7.357906055740658
280. canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt	to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato	locomotive.	10.044938238934247
281. even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against	atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance	is today closer to the nato line.	8.134867725969405
282. on the negative	side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the	united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.	10.824360989302997
283. one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk's	speeches as inconclusive.	8.426323194948276
284. but he hastened to add that	if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusk's	analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the	west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly	fixed its policy.	8.096914765122134
285. a certain vagueness may also	be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council	meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents	accredited.	7.568279421535574
286. the impression has nevertheless been	given during these three days despite mr rusk's personal popularity	that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat	tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn	than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application	to individual danger spots.	7.6431590863493275
287. the secretary of state	himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of	events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the	new administration in the past four months.	8.685033997994665
288. but where the core	of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only	reiterated the united states' profound attachment to the alliance	cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five	nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato's disposal in	european waters.	8.497304996855204
289. the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated	a warning to the soviet union that the united states will	not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken	up by the council as a whole.	8.770773749329155
290. the secretary's	greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization	that east-west friction wherever it take place around the	globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different	societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical	distance or lack of apparent connection.	7.261363381340558
291. the annual spring	meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more deeper	and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use	of the organization for economic cooperation and development	as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries	and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the	maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.	5.83949386284017
292. this increase in the	threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will	prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months	to come.	8.73947500489884
293. each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid	down but never completely fulfilled.	8.191219474181805
294. the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a	geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy	erupts for the first time.	9.937483381210942
295. there is little optimism here	that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table	than they were in military actions on the ground in laos.	10.999376654684301
296. the	united states state department officials explain now is mainly	interested in setting up an international inspection system which will	prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring	thailand and south viet nam.	9.611605655952419
297. they count on the aid	of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve	this.	8.673620888964749
298. the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet	would not become communist dominated.	11.407151058375277
299. but it is apparent that no acceptable	formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.	11.309076896778636
300. the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire	in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the	cease-fire by the international control commission before participating	in the geneva conference.	7.865633826078989
301. this is another of the modifications	of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled	to make.	10.368654372678986
302. it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to	basic errors made in the previous administration.	11.569208217385016
303. its spokesmen	insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in	military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.	7.186929876269805
304. but	with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the	communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:	how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy	decisions been in dealing with communist aggression?	5.363168699674838

307. it does not take a gallup poll to	find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the	situation as republicans see it.	7.948416341387794

316. mr nixon for his part would oppose	intervention in cuba without specific provocation.	11.339405076651923
317. but he did recommend	that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries	shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated.	9.645921198316119
318. until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories	in laos	almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended	a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by	mr nixon and the professors.	8.451760535895916
319. very early	in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels	a high official source disclosed that the new administration	would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during	the formative period of the administration.	6.136327793283938

326. but the communists	aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate.	13.209771399675528
327. and after several	correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the	huge build-up	administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a	great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty	organization.	5.884318614719925
328. seato was steamed up and prepared	contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos.	8.689072357575009
329. but	the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for	the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos.	5.956525924865125
330. there	was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded	that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined	neighbors thailand and south viet nam.	8.527583106071381

620. pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original	13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district	of columbia from a commercial standpoint.	11.229124930230865
621. but from a historic viewpoint	none can approach it.	10.784337784685269

632. many spectators	will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square	opposite the white house.	8.646322409400856
633. in this historic square are several	statutes but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen	andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans.	9.354544464099689

641. what does 1961 offer in political and governmental	developments in mississippi?	9.226698340911984
642.    even for those who have	been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past	is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political	future.	8.415363110503034
643. this is largely because of the unpredictability of the	man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected	leader of its two million inhabitants- gov ross barnett.	7.51771987403881
644. barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public	administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only	keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.	7.807189253490797
645. consequently	it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction	the barnett administration will take in the coming year.	6.838596565473283
646. be scramble	some predict the administration will settle down during	1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.	10.370765261026262
647. the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady	stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments	by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's	office.	5.464648358459376
648. there are many who predict that should barnett decide	to call the legislature back into special session it will really	throw his administration into a scramble.	10.672682288998661
649. certainly nobody	will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett	will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful	honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session.	7.082072192977015
650. if barnett	doesn't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first	year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or	special session.	10.935115875101754
651. the odds favor a special session more than	likely early in the year.	9.062766665558495
652. legislators always get	restless for a special session	and if they start agitating.	9.186722781023406
653. barnett	is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.	9.77691263263911
654. the issue	which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive	problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six	to five to eliminate one congressional seat.	7.881723655877132
655. with eyes focused	on the third congressional district the historic delta district and	congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting	battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers	from the delta have held in the legislature.	6.446795224471283
656. mississippi's	relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads	during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight years	in the white house.	8.966808845238004
657. split badly during the recent presidential	election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and	independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck.	5.825600540494459
658. and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.	15.384170447399443
659. barnett as the titular head of the democratic	party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations	with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist	ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.	6.664702850325769
660. with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin	to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity	in the november election.	9.376125035475086
661. now the picture is clouded and even	us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who	remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status.	6.439785112641254
662. reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen	from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped	of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.	9.897660242714789
663. the gov jimmie h davis administration	appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor's	theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.	6.169533527415774
664. the	year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome	issue.	9.545113441207285
665. but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue-	that of finances in state government.	7.787282867692727
666. the transition from segregation	to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration	proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3	per cent.	10.06045835160112
667. the administration has said the sales tax proposal	is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the	increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.	8.583362577579615
668. but the	tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused	legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all	shortage of cash than to segregation.	9.186369387546339
669. indeed the administration's curious position on the sales tax was	a major factor in contributing to its defeat.	7.202848439076777
670. the administration could	not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.	8.709286219876065
671. the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies	revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining	whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.	7.993795259406477
672. the	tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when	the legislature reconvenes.	10.23516643848444
673. davis may use the tax bill as a	means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature	to normalcy.	6.966710923665701
674. if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and	say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent	integration.	11.967067536973126
675. he could terminate special sessions of the legislature.	11.858615591614702
676. actually	davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.	12.646676580611404
677. many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing	battle to block token integration.	5.3803790176381066
678. this is not the sort	of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.	14.674837515760329
679. they would	like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is	something they know to be ineffectual.	10.009192540796105
680. passage	of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect	a transition.	11.06378118637588
681. he could tell the legislature they had provided the	needed funds to carry on the battle.	8.891787730727936
682. then he could tell them to	go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with	the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in	over an eight months period.	8.547766350782318
683. it is difficult to be certain how	the administration views that $28 million since the views of one leader	may not be the same as the views of another one.	9.460923248088841
684. but if	the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a	grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek	a way to use the money for other purposes.	9.110686699655943
685. this would be in	perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration-	the shortage of cash.	6.928099437551684
686. it could become an acute problem in the coming	fiscal year.	16.534348827654902
687. if the administration does not succeed in passing	the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be	faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting	dilemma.	8.606674015904318
688. since the constitution forbids introduction	of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have	to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.	8.86225129809169
689. in either case it could call a special session	of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising	additional revenues through a tax raiser.	7.420112189926242
690. the prospect of cutting	back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.	11.050369600123325
691. it is one	that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach	to the problem.	11.180870180170041
692. but if all alternatives should be clearly	blocked	off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps	to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature.	12.79187979917471
693. this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by	the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more	receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.	8.545984176927982
694. a constant problem	confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge	by his foes that he has not tried to economize.	9.765494907089636
695. any tax bill	also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using	their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.	6.421519772218211
696. the new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or	token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to	combat some of these criticisms.	8.949773532508248
697. city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the	bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage	of a private contracting company which had an inside track	with the city.	5.545032974770555

705. managing director donald	c wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a	period of sharp disagreement on the matter.	6.102713039398561
706. the announcement	that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made	by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following	a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city	and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that	was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959.	8.705572155876139

1212. but he also achieved something that endeared	him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot.	11.122946993209094
1213. a couple of weeks ago	he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole.	8.905920003425774
1214. and	it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were	meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving	them to despair.	8.75942595531428
1215. if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could	commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all.	7.373663438480721
1216. it	was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden	that motivated arnold.	8.231973612395322
1217. he merely became victimized by a form	of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all.	7.2326373342122645
1218. the world's	best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening	round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering	a final crusher.	8.895745301255657

1226. each	of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes.	9.177079992982922
1227. so he wound up with a	dozen.	13.389061616448519
1228. it was a nice round figure that 12 he said as	he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed.	13.625429670761982
1229. from the	standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening	exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways	during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open.	6.360647466684763
1230. the idol of	the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a 19 in the united	states open.	10.634073132922786
1231. their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm	who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his	way out of a rock-strewn gully.	5.862565044757813
1232. willie's partner was long jim barnes	who tried to keep count.	6.005500478334088

1234.  asked willie at one stage of his excavation project.	11.205413491852301
1235. nae man	said willie ye must be countin' the echoes.	5.335488561388262
1236. palmer's dozen were honestly earned.	5.456813733596016
1237. nor were there any rules	to save him.	8.377541913169225
1238. if there had been he would have found a loophole because	arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man	who wrote the book.	11.86623721968442
1239. this knowledge has come in handy too.	11.942322512594911
1240. his	first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along	the right side of the fairway.	11.18206674998795

1242. arnold sent for	joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association.	11.94079541328623
1243. joe naturally	ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had	originally entered the stream.	6.156642893645679
1244. i knew it all along confessed	arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much	nicer it would be to drop one way up there.	11.566585783614913
1245. for a serious young	man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an	inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves	from jangling like banjo strings.	6.301604555773539
1246. yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.	12.18509575599383
1247. he'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure	he's right.	3.7955035061066957
1248. that's how he first won the masters in 1958.	5.366197672016495
1249. it happened on the twelfth hole a 155-yarder.	12.36971271279446
1250. arnold's iron shot	from	the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment	that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local	rules into force.	6.395921720638805
1251. i can remove the ball	can't i?	11.73150529389959
1252.  asked palmer of an official.	12.925880461623924
1253. you must play it where it lies.	13.64366790916533
1254. you're	wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules.	9.32725443957411
1255. i'll do	as you say but i'll also play a provisional ball and get a	ruling.	3.629314207754895
1256. he scored a 4 for the embedded ball a 3 with the provisional	one.	11.582220921947851
1257. the golfing fathers ruled in his favor.	8.486181488182273
1258. so he picked up a stroke	with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of	that stroke.	10.493593844710242
1259. until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer	was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.	7.011959697370739
1260. but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger	hero than he ever had been before.	15.981028253405855

2288. probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment	community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was	sold to the public during the past week.	11.848913628703109
2289. for many reasons the	demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.	7.321883963753798
2290. it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the	stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers	and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.	10.815895812537672
2291. investors	who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers	who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100	and counted themselves lucky to get that many.	5.839523176424379

2293. some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of	their customers.	7.623283656245602
2294. a measure of how hot the stock was can be	found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.	15.281557500366569
2295. the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.	9.32778799757544
2296. the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler	guerin + turner the managing underwriter was at $17 a share.	5.394892426849305
2297. and	from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday	morning at around $22 a share.	5.926710505920742
2298. but the morton foods issue	was hot long before it was on the market.	17.95733369071455
2299. indeed from the moment the	reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last	january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.	6.1149531973234765
2300. letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the	nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would	be sold	.	11.478764794807056
2301. there was even	a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned	about the dallas stock offering.	8.32114291254531
2302. we subscribe 500 shares of morton	foods of texas.	11.494102302845878
2303. cable confirmation it said translated.	8.06896989842052
2304. but	egt could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares.	9.672587193577433
2305. after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group	members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.	6.814402872650271
2306. but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin	believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all	over the nation.	11.58371301776466
2307. i feel confident the stock will qualify for	the 'national list' he said meaning its market price would	be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.	5.838472470003152
2308. he was	also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved	again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a	job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do.	9.737974523828234
2309. but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one?	13.791300290588504
2310. 	the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.	15.78030894741611
2311. first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last	few months driving stocks of all kinds up.	8.234678133843099
2312. as a result it is not	easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced	10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64c	.	13.306913030287244
2313. second the potato chip industry	has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods	came along there were only two potato chip stocks- frito and h	w lay- on the market.	5.091663180500804
2314. both of those have had dynamic run-ups	in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher	price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market	at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock	to have a fast run-up.	8.097720102203011
2315. and third the potato chip industry has	taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of	late.	9.29490440326854
2316. foods which long had been considered recession resistant	but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going	to higher price-earnings ratios.	6.871461356321019
2317. the potato chip industry these	days is growing not only as a	result of population increase and public	acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination	of circumstances	that has led to growth by merger.	8.271941016664986
2318. the history of the	us potato chip industry is that many of today's successful	companies got started during the deep depression days.	8.655678277520636
2319. those that remain	are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities	to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.	7.285886451988816
2320. but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and	suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their	closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management	in their firms.	9.582953569886831
2321. so they go looking for mergers with other	firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on	the doors of firms like frito.	6.257470157129956
2322. all those things combined to	make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.	12.660639285126155
2323. now if morton's newest product a corn chip known as chip-o's	turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out	to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up	to.	5.741557513498124
2324. dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and	distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the	millions of dollars.	7.575310836384481
2325. more than 10 companies maintain facilities	in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at	sherman.	8.76726196994766

2712. it's much more complex than that.	3.1841542326753927
2713. generally they go to school with	a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car.	9.120555022459296
2714. this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails	a certain loss of social status.	17.141170301396702
2715. a young man doesn't like to be driven	up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even	in a higher class than he is and is also a girl.	7.983405213053728
2716. why don't	you walk to school then?	8.985153849915235

2728. i've tried to compromise	by letting them take the little car now and then.	5.919917883760167

2734. but when	gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually	ride with her so the little car isn't big enough.	9.770036852279391
2735. the	logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a	fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody	knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself.	7.369025169702204
2736. the	solution naturally is the bus.	10.712906238302466

2760. here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute	and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases.	5.010252031759538
2761. most children	love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and	they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than	put away in boxes.	6.798166555963068
2762. displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children	and are decorative accent.	8.045964676280578
2763. to create such a lamp order	a wired pedestal from any lamp shop.	6.9602287455990615
2764. measure the puppet to determine	the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the	puppet's head.	9.022653548356015
2765. make sure that the metal tube through which the wire	passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the	l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly	under the light.	8.191051594247362
2766. using the strings that manipulate	the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the	strings to the lamp base.	9.314959286435936
2767. in this way you can arrange his legs and arms	in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on	the pedestal.	8.095205252393283
2768. if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them	in accord with your child's whims.	9.657363156617283
2769. although a straight drum	shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could	be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades	in the gay spirit of a child's playtime.	6.092142506722138

2776. this	isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's according to decorator	consultant leland alden.	5.62142288557668
2777. housewives are finding literally	hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs	says mr alden and they are doing it largely because colonial	craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical.	6.38585835594911

2866. the leningrad kirov ballet which opened a series of performances	friday night at the opera house is i think the finest classical	ballet company i have ever seen and the production of	the petipa-tschaikowsky sleeping beauty with which it began	the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of	witnessing.	9.45299067719923
2867. this work is no favorite of mine.	10.386514444314221
2868. i am prepared	to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of imperial	russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect; that	its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates	that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was;	that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot	to boobify the american people; that its choreography is undistinguished	and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms.	7.475342434890653

3031. hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often	that he didn't help around the house and that he didn't really	care about the family.	4.504687690009509

3036. without any definite	plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done.	11.60109402238924
3037. the	judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations-	then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from	family	service before going to a lawyer.	5.666550242154242

3042. the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of	the problems confronting the other.	11.126257160004108
3043. they are now working together toward	solving their difficulties.	9.621032943695413
3044. john received a promotion	in his firm.	10.847044125782281
3045. he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on	life.	10.024507857027007
3046. mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings	and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session	of happy family rough-housing.	6.173297433868495
3047. to outsiders the blacks seem	to be an ordinary happy family and they are- but with a difference.	6.607664595384915
3048. they know the value of being just that- an ordinary happy family.	10.559696910319058
3049. family service has helped hundreds of families in this	area.	8.768642549004328
3050. perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital.	12.630463119319943
3051. but	to the families it serves their help cannot be measured.	6.604798955714968
3052. family service	could not open its doors to a single family without the financial	support of the united givers fund.	10.38992763136013
3053. anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to	materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip	got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.	6.44586034491962
3054. one of the initial questions put to president	kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his	attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev.	11.950834012841284
3055. mr kennedy	replied:    i'm hopeful that from  more traditional	exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground.	4.70808968762547
3056. the	president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or	later probably was inevitable and even desirable.	9.336719405438076
3057. but he was convinced	that the realities of power- military economic and ideological-	were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that	these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting.	7.043648376844179
3058. he	wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and	to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.	10.955760866611955
3059. last friday	the white house announced:   president kennedy will	meet	with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june 3 and	4.	5.737747357058209
3060. the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration	in east-west relations.	10.851817248772901
3061. the heightened tension in fact had been	a major factor in the president's change of view about the urgency	of a meeting with the soviet leader.	7.114101074408271
3062. he was not going to vienna	to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow	last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned.	10.813602947184494
3063. but	mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with	mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.	9.00412714572089
3064. that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting.	10.706527218936131
3065. despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance	of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters	of the cold war.	10.064534184376194
3066. the u s and	soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston	churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy	with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the	summit of the nations.	10.343180919318913
3067. the first time was in 1955 when a	full-dress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva.	8.65244043383053
3068. the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads	into the middle east.	10.525628665770679
3069. in 1959 president eisenhower	and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s.	10.844306948192953
3070. that meeting produced the spirit of camp david- a spirit it	later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress	toward a berlin settlement.	8.240570718773768
3071. on the third occasion- another	big four summit session at paris a year ago- there was no problem	of an illusory spirit.	6.492325210749289
3072. premier khrushchev wrecked the conference	at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s	for the u-2 incident.	8.387516087876469
3073. the episode tended to confirm the u	s belief that propaganda the hope of one-sided concessions and	the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were	the soviet leader's real aims in summitry.	5.014320606359807
3074. thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration	that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr	kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem.	11.32940329202531
3075. shortly before his	nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations	with the soviet leader in these words:   as long	as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is	shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp	david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful	negotiations.	6.556885109216768
3076. the president had set for himself the task which	he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to	the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance.	11.305961864653277
3077. he did	not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make	it unnecessary.	7.322431152029472
3078. he wanted time too to review the united states'	global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited	and new ones he was formulating.	8.871939152202119
3079. above all he did not want to appear	to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev's doorstep.	8.870862410633961
3080. flexible	at the same time the president took pains not to	rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader.	11.637385106815023
3081. ideally he knew	it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels.	6.941762985752825
3082. but mr	kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue	hopes were not raised in connection with it.	10.244320150761054
3083. it would give him an	opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war	to try to probe mr khrushchev's intentions and to make clear	his own views.	7.822903244708698
3084. moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no	other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not	inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.	9.99011352450527
3085. both elements- the caution about a meeting the willingness	eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the president	which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia	late in february.	5.618909686107598
3086. the letter dated feb 22 was delivered to	premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march 9.	8.708875246449772
3087. it dealt	mainly with a broad range of east-west issues.	10.724114587673025
3088. but it also briefly	suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before	the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and	schedules permitted.	14.201107181250043
3089. developments over the next two months however	caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing.	8.860766422636488
3090. there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house	about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international	climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating	alarmingly.	12.032732045196344
3091. the president was especially	concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at	geneva.	8.86707904353735
3092. the deadlock has been caused by the russians' new demand	for a three-man directorate and thus a veto	over the control machinery.	7.582865432307842
3093. in the u s strong pressures	have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians	may be secretly testing.	11.567634336946371
3094. mr kennedy was less troubled	by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown	or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear	weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.	10.105634978995534
3095. there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was	also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly	to communist china.	11.317848717553192
3096. the question arose as to whether a frank discussion	of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent.	11.699214266892685
3097. moreover	moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle	to the executive organs of all international bodies including	the u n secretariat and the international control commission	for laos.	6.070331687519678
3098. mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand	would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible.	11.1781087616134
3099. developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability	of an early summit meeting.	7.090882114517335
3100. initially the white house reaction	was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict	in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting.	8.125121647193843
3101. at the same time	there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader	as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion	about the west's ability and determination to resist communist	pressure.	6.883466989872798
3102. in cuba the u s had blundered badly and	created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even	on its own doorstep.	11.286194080330043
3103. in laos the picture was almost equally bad.	11.599801567525827
3104. u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier	khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized	on soviet terms.	13.881885678659424
3105. beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention	in laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed	moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic	moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces.	4.905532260166428
3106. as a result	the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva	negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast	asia are under increased pressure.	10.030802265000721
3107. in the light of those	events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev	might overreach himself.	10.566199821729924
3108. ambassador thompson reported from moscow	that the soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.	6.9708308075229395
3109. he has indicated	that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out.	8.929445976349912
3110. the	president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn	premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such	as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning	back.	10.442898613417325
3111. it was in the midst of such white house deliberations	that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the	u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in	the near future.	9.825087951191112
3112. mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer	by may 20 after consultation with the allies.	10.396413069408966
3113. the response from	london paris and bonn was favorable.	7.994199783368999
3114. firm arrangements for the meeting	in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and	washington last week.	8.688820345577197
3115. apparently at the insistence of the u s	the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow	last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting.	8.450887257596811
3116. the	washington announcement said:    the president and chairman	khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose	of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems	that involve the interest of many other countries.	8.009612266747792
3117. the meeting	will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first	personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the	major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries.	6.41089054086535
3118. the vienna meeting will bring together a	seasoned	67-year-old veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedy's	own words is shrewd tough vigorous well-informed and confident	and a 44-year-old president with a	demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international	diplomacy.	6.5300504257887635
3119. the announcement last week of the forthcoming	encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval	and disapproval.	10.46534207315925
3120. the approval did not arise from an expectation	of far-reaching agreements at vienna.	8.746601282955712
3121. the inclination was to accept	the statement that there would be no formal negotiations.	9.577665493905224
3122. but those	who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between	the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.	12.457558568408931
3123. mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about	his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men.	8.629117145210575
3124. the feeling was	that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the	president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause.	9.790013305476334
3125. apart from the personal equation another reason advanced	in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us	appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit.	8.945440634258468
3126. premier khrushchev	has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got	his summit meeting anyway.	12.698899675246238
3127. this time the initiative came in part	at least from washington.	9.682625199805242
3128. there was also	the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president	will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied	leaders.	13.328200986290595
3129. thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader	of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity.	8.090178810838887
3130. finally	there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president's	making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test	accord.	10.05031836174313
3131. there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings	throughout the world.	12.39726954477812
3132. if tests are to be resumed the argument went	it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to	the soviet union.	11.869803154582224
3133. disapproval of the meeting was based largely	on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse.	9.772506792815403
3134. after cuba	and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the president's	consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness-	perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage	he now believes he holds.	6.8127869696621275
3135. moreover the president is meeting the	soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided	on the scope of america's firm foreign policy commitments.	7.444138326265441
3136. the	question was raised for example as to what attitude the president	would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending	from southeast asia to the middle east.	8.34817734573559
3137. there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of	adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.	7.872982712869037
3138. mollusks are a case in point.	11.22390191344247
3139. the shell which served the strain	so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended	to cancel out the possibility of future development.	7.107927849531686
3140. though this may	or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and	the weakness of american catholic higher education.	9.687440107345513
3141. there can	be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field	of higher education is most impressive: our european brethren never	cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.	8.26069230274092
3142. the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades	rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.	8.673319563693832
3143. by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement	stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which	brought the parochial school system into existence.	6.912966878298424
3144. there	is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture.	9.319682857288738
3145. viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect	we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school	to university.	6.313397129208867
3146. but the simple truth is that higher education has	never really been an official american catholic project; certainly	not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school	system has been a matter of official policy.	10.342871226256065
3147. official encouragement	is one thing but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan	and parochial funds.	5.231082729636129
3148. american catholics have responded generously	to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to	create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar	fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning.	8.10501636636711
3149. they	have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly	ever been made.	7.16245784687459
3150. diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this	as their direct responsibility.	8.377682622354797
3151. all of this may be understandable	enough: it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan	authorities could have acted otherwise.	8.165473310881005
3152. yet for better or for worse	the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do	not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to	the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious	communities.	10.62517661112568
3153. community esprit de corps has been the protective	shell which has made the achievement possible.	9.608785456244341
3154. to understand	the past history- and the future potential- of american catholic	higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character	of the esprit d' corps of the religious community.	7.178231987601147
3155. it is something	more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and	detachment.	9.518619422726305
3156. a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves	a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found	elsewhere.	10.008554997825522
3157. the fact that the group orientation and group identification	are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs	of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.	7.629961523682329
3158. the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship	the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting	edge of sacrifice and hardship.	9.3429452025571
3159. american catholic colleges	and universities are in a very real sense the product of private	enterprise- the private enterprise of religious communities.	7.667773041382036
3160. had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities	might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized	by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious	as paid employees.	9.05614657125685
3161. there is however no point in speculating about such	a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of	higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which	produces the family business.	8.51431168333991
3162. this family-community spirit	is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement.	9.439598829365151
3163. it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american	catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication	apparent in some areas.	8.68712954601904
3164. i think for example of three women's colleges	with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of	a major catholic university which is also co-educational.	9.578982192753942
3165. this is not	an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented	upon often enough.	7.696102733040409
3166. it would seem to represent esprit de corps	run riot.	20.87100458293981
3167. apart however from the question of wasteful duplication	there is another aspect of the family business spirit	in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.	9.589551679368471
3168. for while the past needs of the church in this country may have	been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone	closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would	seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles	the university in its pursuit of excellence.	8.897433392082458
3169. at the earlier	pre-academic excellence stage of catholic education the operation	could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis.	5.813019514224829
3170. but with today's	demand for professional qualifications and specialized training	the need for outsiders become more pressing.	8.84599559385269
3171. the problem	is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but	that a different brand is called for.	7.312392982447563
3172. commenting on the earlier stage	the notre dame chapter of the american association of university	professors	noted that the term teacher-employee	was	a not inapt description.	9.164494621451546
3173. today however the outsider is likely	to have professional qualifications of the highest order	and to be acclimatized	to the democratic processes of the secular or state university.	6.479906951916795
3174. and	while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar	will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second	class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank	or professional achievement.	7.707377853557933
3175. in the above mentioned report of	the notre dame chapter of the american association of university	professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges	very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see	it: even with the best of intentions he	is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to	a group the membership of which considered in	individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying	temperament interests and capabilities.	7.1002763446587265
3176. it is natural that he should	turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization	which actually owns the university and whose goals are in	their opinion identified with its highest good and	'the attainment of excellence'.	8.852536706833337
3177. the pattern	here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame: it is simply	that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution	by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious	where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty.	6.468054123949948
3178. it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report	should refer to the organization which actually owns the university:	this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more	to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension.	13.159465404781097
3179. but	in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines	to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy	one.	9.070216248352951
3180. outside faculty members want to be considered partners in	the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.	11.211831648060171
3181. there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with	this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university.	12.587040292373326
3182. in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber	personnel.	17.49818354283989
3183. word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession	much given to attending meetings and conferences.	6.52796464360239
3184. expressions	of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member	has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype.	6.982774276936797
3185. in	the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or	a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines	to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions	at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.	6.897952582225188
3186. to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized	that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security	that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does	in an elementary school system or in the civil service.	10.635011603586795
3187. much has	been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee	firm tenure.	11.433975734860725
3188. this is a significant advance but its import should not	be exaggerated.	14.345619928249592
3189. when a man invests a block of his years at a university	without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the	problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in	the market value of his services.	7.793813726735458
3190. a man does not make that kind of	gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure	positions is being reserved for members of the family.	13.289252475096541
3191. just	as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new	tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance	of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions.	8.350432116648756
3192. yet adequate compensation-	and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute	for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his	earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place.	7.968050333548122
3193. broadly	speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible	but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature	responsibility in the total work of the university.	6.784764875540547
3194. religious who	derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious	community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate	both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this	identification.	7.72497151213527
3195. there is no need here to spell out the conditions	of creative teaching except to point out that at the college	level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even	more necessary than it is at other levels.	11.226752112190193
3196. the college teacher needs	the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also	needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the	luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution.	9.325166780438073
3197. but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from	the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.	7.897213099998587
3198. the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy	between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and	operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is	therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.	10.15110526538132
3199. this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary	and tenure.	12.138808051392996
3200. yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive	resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless	certain suggestions which seem to be in order.	12.616525899651966
3201. the first	is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty	committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real	authority.	6.197822190427274
3202. in the case of academic personnel the feeling of	participation can hardly be faked.	16.974195136713
3203. competent teachers are well	versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without	destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own	decisions.	5.003077186712575
3204. those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar	with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to	be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making.	8.309486559397754
3205. in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of	participation are what is called for at all.	10.267926837958434
3206. in the notre dame report	reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced	to luncheon-table communication.	14.083133011304959
3207. in itself there is nothing wrong	with this form of participation: the only difficulty on the	catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position	to implement policy ie members of the religious community which	owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements.	6.956030210211303
3208. sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david	martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions	under the anti-monopoly laws.	7.158476623153288
3209. once more the fallacious equation is advanced	to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly	laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions:	the law must treat everybody equally.	5.486719080791055
3210. or in the words of anatole	france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich	as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under	bridges.	10.243389597965674
3211. the public atmosphere that has been generated which	makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute	into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellan's	hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and later	into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations	at the missile sites.	6.167504681455715
3212. the senator was shocked by stoppages over	allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program.	8.897817202664761
3213. in addition	disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess	of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation	on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill.	7.093562623410561
3214. it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but	he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes	to fight a strike.	9.848378147176666
3215. business week reports that	the united aircraft company against which the international association	of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants	operating.	6.075352656955559
3216. the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable	to four factors: advertising to attract new employees hiring	and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by	the new workers.	6.221353635868456
3217. the company has billed the united states government	for $7500000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation	allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and	necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.	7.310314725509654
3218. rep	frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the	attention of the armed services committee.	8.856706677682908
3219. neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan	been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor	abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.	4.859557378140325
3220. the	recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution	of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers	has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified	neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.	6.579845863471484
3221. the	anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely	undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is	a winner.	5.817809321445392
3222. the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully	cannot follow the law.	18.49978082697061
3223. hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a	foolish public policy.	7.712753244768429
3224. let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods	industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of	other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy	to rig prices and allocate the market.	9.096894582326396
3225. the industry is so structured	that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way	overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing	is applied.	4.178787370316771
3226. the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise	is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods	in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.	13.346217755046897
3227. accounting procedures	can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price.	6.816358779812407
3228. naturally	enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to	structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors	can be forced to the wall in a very short time.	11.445868932477916
3229. should these giants	really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only	survivors in the industry.	6.560512753379273
3230. uncle sam would then accuse them of creating	a monopoly by unfair competition.	10.116603133062979
3231. but if they show self-restraint	they don't get the orders.	6.443498660516824
3232. under the circumstances	the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage	in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter	were convicted.	10.197816509576011
3233. engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy	by the giants.	7.925025990008774
3234. the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by	the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric	sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices	so low as to compete seriously with its fellows.	9.383168168512459
3235. in other words	the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday	wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer	on tuesday thursday and saturday.	6.255537461124528
3236. and which theory would	govern the enforcers of the law on sunday?	12.197717175052087
3237. 	the question	might be asked: don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods	manufacturers know these facts?	3.1153421907347116
3238.  why did they engage in a	flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise	to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in	the laws?	8.203741091266835
3239.    the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to	management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism	back in 1937.	4.790518274333004
3240. he wrote:  h the anti-trust	laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need	of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place	in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure.	7.867005165619132
3241. h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled	business dictatorship.	5.142782597286237
3242. h when corporate abuses were attacked	it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked	rather than control.	9.52306625169829
3243. h in this manner every scheme for direct	control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust	laws.	7.514186062142894
3244. h in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust	laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial	empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most	fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation	is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control	by the government.	10.456337922843124
3245. this escape from control has led to management's	evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as	worth while.	6.754384396627597
3246. a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine	after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license.	10.204988092366843
3247. penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail	sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions perhaps because	the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing	if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control	of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must	be devised for representing the public interest.	4.945083153564595
3248. a secret conspiracy	of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle.	10.943692961894767
3249. however one can argue that	no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust	laws are effective and rational.	6.089843749703383
3250. quite clearly the anti-trust laws	are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that	they should be extended to the labor union.	6.049206276636878
3251. those who	favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating	a brand new reform.	5.545460920789202
3252. before 1933 individuals who opposed	trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english.	9.661241917610141
3253. the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934	implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial	recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining	in principle.	7.222264100612401
3254. the wagner act the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin	act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.	7.527171095128448
3255. the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system	is the removal of wages from competition.	6.796069897890858
3256. if a union cannot perform	this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers	as a gigantic fraud.	9.548988423157182
3257. the tortured reasoning that unions	use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply	and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.	7.671176470564766
3258. the problem must be faced squarely.	17.059628672900654
3259. if laborers are merely commodities	competing against each other in a market place like so many bags	of wheat and corn	then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism	to a system that imposes such status upon them.	7.030092564384264
3260. human labor	was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century	america.	4.6473434593401555
3261. as early as 1776 adam smith wrote in the wealth of	nations: we have no acts of parliament against combining	to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it.	5.750007220556556
3262. eighteenth-century england upon whose customs our common law was	built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.	6.341674183479389
3263. in 1825	the boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced	by the organized employers who declared: it is h considered	that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to h effect	the value of labor h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies.	4.6451268922378155
3264. there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for	collective bargaining but against labor monopoly.	11.835944520941858
3265. the courts	shared the opinion of the employers.	12.265129935525392
3266. in people vs fisher justice	savage of the new york supreme court declared:   without	any officious and improper interference on the subject the	price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand	for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid	for it; but the right does not exist to raise h the wages of the mechanic	by any forced and artificial means.	8.524201939702927
3267. compare this statement	of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin according	to the daily labor report of sept 19 1961 defends	the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor	if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or	prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his	employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment.	5.720889694772027
3268. senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust	measures to unions in transportation.	8.086730350047908
3269. his bill allegedly aimed at	hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norris-laguardia acts	to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation	strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert	with any other union- even a sister local in the same international.	5.132330336660327
3270. paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was	attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation	the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they	met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action	would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.	6.486805823567908
3271. indeed it	is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently	granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example	the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the	encouragement of railroads to seek mergers.	5.486968742555368
3272. at the very moment that	every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality	of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective	bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions	who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that	ship operators set freight rates.	8.836643548013846
3273. the passage of the	sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies.	8.570389315010768
3274. it was most effective against	trade unions.	20.1221359286297
3275. in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was	brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices	eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product	of the struck manufacturer.	6.536123475411545
3276. the suit against the union was successful	and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.	10.625703482957544
3277. in 1914 the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under	the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be	considered a commodity.	6.25504931449612
3278. the law could not suspend economics.	14.76551116115134
3279. labor remained	a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization	from the anti-trust laws.	3.882529575133598
3280. the courts by interpretation	emasculated the act.	11.964736829509357
3281. in 1922 the united mine workers struck the	coronado coal company.	8.174372246278933
3282. the company sued under the anti-trust laws	alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of	interstate commerce.	6.156022586836941
3283. the	court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference	with commerce.	6.55836583533933
3284. at a closed-door session	on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made	his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on	us affairs abroad.	9.885351580984636
3285. afterward tennessee's democratic senator	albert gore summed it up for newsmen.	5.44569934256235
3286. what herter presented	said gore was not a very encouraging review.	11.900259472869585
3287. that was something	of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between	the west and communism erupted on three fronts.	7.755642454949581
3288. while communists	were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos	two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration	hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery dictator	fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and	drastic demand: within 48 hours the us had to reduce its	embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons	embassy staff alone totaled 87 us citizens plus 120 cuban	.	6.957740915822307
3289. president eisenhower held an 8:30 am meeting with	top military and foreign-policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic	relations immediately.	4.957577035605809
3290. there is a limit to what the united	states in self-respect can endure said the president.	17.384054472230634
3291. that limit	has now been reached.	10.398899961253363
3292. through secretary herter ike	offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new	administration with the breakoff decision.	7.7555116580325585
3293. kennedy through secretary-designate	of state dean rusk declined.	7.02678888104831
3294. he thus kept his hands	free for any action after jan 20 although reaction to the break	was generally favorable in the us and latin america	after a white house huddle	between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted	sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that	several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north	viet nam.	7.76635274085727
3295. in view of the present situation in laos said the	pentagon's announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions	to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific.	7.99563863505694
3296. cutting	short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington	and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied	by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines.	7.135949469503741
3297. on the us's island base of okinawa task force 116 made	up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move	southward on signal.	6.031495882948348
3298. but by week's end the laotian cry of	invasion was read as an exaggeration and	the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies	that a neutralist- rather than a pro-western- government might	be best for laos.	6.416017519320364
3299. there was a moral of	sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war	fronts.	10.611763415334751
3300. political economic and military experts were all agreed that	chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world	to fight a war- and they were probably right.	7.949051681333267
3301. it would be like fighting	the french and indian war all over again said one military	man.	12.133040196689114
3302. but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground?	14.635617774586382
3303. 	at geneva in 1954 to get the war in indo-china settled the	british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands	and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet	nam- which then predictably became a base for communist operations	against neighboring south viet nam and laos.	5.793637008107747
3304. the late secretary	of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement	a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to	keep it from becoming a calamity for the west.	9.065693502980025
3305. he began the diplomatic	discussions that resulted in the establishment of seato.	13.759757607504676
3306. the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the	past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern	viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout	southeast asia.	11.832039762616088
3307. russian tanks and artillery parading through	the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian	arms drops in laos	made it plain once more	that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time.	6.297191396314414
3308. soviet premier	khrushchev sent new year's hopes for peace to president-elect	kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply.	5.949556450489015
3309. considering the	state of the whole world the cold war's three exposed fronts did	not seem terribly ominous; but in senator gore's words it was	not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f	kennedy on inauguration day.	4.725777000450902
3310. _turmoil in the	house liberal	democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled	by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal	legislation to the floor.	8.566208682321983
3311. the liberal pressure bloc	had fought the	committee before and had always lost.	7.441090543161455
3312. this time they were much better	prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable.	11.683722170967345
3313. they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy whose own	legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck.	7.4010435898540505
3314. and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will.	12.533893110843891
3315. there were two possible methods of breaching	to pack	it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock	to remove one of the conservatives- namely mississippi's	14-term william meyers colmer.	5.586473930105259
3316. caucusing the	liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic	course since seniority in the house is next to godliness.	9.646223930347563
3317. a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than	his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist	position	to that of a diehard conservative.	6.124500740519185
3318. he is generally and initially	suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his	gulf coast constituents.	10.617507789475065
3319. he is of course a segregationist but	he says he has never made an anti-negro speech.	10.868819167122535
3320. for 20 years he	has enjoyed his power on the rules committee.	13.528003985426716
3321. there his vote along	with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge	and the four republican members could and often did produce a 6-6	deadlock that blocked far-out	democratic-sponsored welfare legislation	.	5.275741353494629
3322. there was	sufficient pretext to demand colmer's ouster: he had given his	lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi.	7.3728494406174585
3323. reprisals	are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has	been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons.	6.191590456873111
3324. in 1949 the dixiecrats	escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry	truman and in 1957	after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned	for dwight eisenhower in 1956 his fellow democrats did not touch	his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily	of his patronage.	7.306097179778556
3325. judge	smith threatened reprisal against powell.	7.56852154895156
3326. said he: we will	but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with	president-elect kennedy decided that this year something had to be	done about the rules committee- and that he was the only man who could	do anything effective.	7.688824710189473
3327. in a tense closed-door session with	judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add	three new members to the rules committee	.	6.725322348262763
3328. smith flatly rejected the offer	and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels.	10.016134203511367
3329. the next	morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and	broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he	is said to regard as an inferior man.	5.856509776342055
3330. news of	rayburn's	commitment soon leaked out.	8.654401047285399
3331. when missouri's clarence cannon got	the word he turned purple.	6.287292171294225
3332. unconscionable! he shouted and	rushed off to the speaker's room to object: a dangerous precedent!	cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support	to the smith-colmer forces: as chairman of the appropriations	committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding	this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.	4.883356727840361
3333. sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge	smith ally georgia's carl vinson chairman of the armed services	committee.	5.525850018897207
3334. as the battle raged in the cloakrooms	and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose.	10.766106569871958
3335. his	highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice	that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus.	4.730545519713032
3336. the liberals	smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three	big votes- in the democratic committee on committees in the full	party caucus and on the floor of the house- before they could oust	colmer.	9.58253394963018
3337. the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported	in all three arenas they seemed certain	of victory- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash.	6.128648211324841
3338. but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter	of losing a costlier war.	12.831890520642652
3339. if the southerners were sufficiently aroused	they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons	from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam	rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party.	6.3068637933135445
3340. with that possibility	in mind arkansas' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a	meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought	to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort	of face-saving compromise.	7.995315644585616
3341. here are two old men mad at each other	and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader.	8.736099376057705
3342. one wants a little more power and the other doesn't want	to give up any.	10.658591252584582
3343. the senate launched the	87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative	battle but in contrast with the house's guerrilla war it seemed	as pro forma as a capitol guide's speech.	4.870096222900965
3344. question at issue:	how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate- and	thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?	6.172255235197962
3345.    a wide-ranging	bipartisan force- from minnesota's democratic hubert humphrey	to massachusetts' republican leverett saltonstall- was	drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally	used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills.	3.9708230194301235
3346. new mexico's	clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate's	notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and	voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.	6.280133206592162
3347. fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a	mere majority of senators.	5.9856978665827825
3348. georgia's dick russell objected politely	and the battle was joined.	5.616137706575091
3349. privately the liberals admitted	that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage.	6.382255618954592
3350. privately	they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson's three-fifths	modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon.	6.533276466321503
3351. in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of	senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each	new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were	not binding.	7.3173342964317944
3352. armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals	rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate	on the filibuster battle this week.	9.703103583584072
3353. hopefully the perennial battle	of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all.	6.847908812812445
3354. since election day vice president	richard nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public	view.	6.713356815994862
3355. but with the convening of the new congress he was the public	man again presiding over the senate until john kennedy's inauguration.	7.65098361292907
3356. one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore	that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to	hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to	make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated	him in the tight 1960 presidential election.	9.314813735248624
3357. nixon fulfilled his	assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration.	6.163979312961575
3358. this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate	for the presidency announced the result of an election in which	he was defeated he said.	14.245989496687933
3359. the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do	to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.	7.285986373188658
3360. gary player the small	trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his 25	years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the	victory to drop in his lap.	7.765884523938256
3361. arnold palmer the defending champion lost	his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that	left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.	7.0515847453389515
3362. just when you	think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you	player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament.	10.132456540814324
3363. and	that is just what happened on the last few holes.	10.487814420924924
3364. the augusta national	golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer.	9.579891694854492
3365. player was the first to feel its teeth.	10.924385087126605
3366. after playing a splendid first	nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final	day of the tournament	player's	game rapidly fell to pieces.	5.8555168612891375
3367. after a journey through	woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th.	6.863199070246627
3368. he bogeyed the 15th	by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three	holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total	of 280.	6.729360069412541
3369. as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course	player was almost in tears.	8.243451226083575
3370. he could read on the nearby scoreboard	that palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke.	9.87996835179393
3371. palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at	one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.	9.777941521446406
3372. now	all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the	biggest single paycheck in golf.	9.931372626077842
3373. when palmer hit a good straight	drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship	won.	10.227528701200006
3374. but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green	strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression.	8.87785080686814
3375. in trying to	hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green	past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower.	7.785599178423532
3376. afterwards	palmer told charlie coe his last-round partner that he	simply played the hole too fast.	6.397602786115707
3377. he did seem hasty on his second and	third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while	coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his	composure	which he had quite visibly lost.	7.311406820847178
3378. when the shaken palmer	finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet.	9.75592329181583
3379. palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting	beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman	clifford roberts' clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when	palmer missed the putt.	5.873745709068646
3380. palmer's 281 for the four rounds	at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest	pro but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe.	7.463688511421095
3381. the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch	tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters	overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.	7.515358282838591
3382. at seven	until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played	seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters- four last year	and three this- without ever being out of first place.	6.726978944315854
3383. as evening	approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing	one-over-par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to	his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69.	5.417979487833268
3384. his three-round total	of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by bill	collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing	very well all winter long.	7.525585512026943
3385. but palmer knew as did everybody	else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken.	8.753985652038738
3386. half an hour	after he finished his round player holed out at the 18th green with	a 69 and a three-round total of 206 four strokes ahead of palmer.	8.231919081653869
3387. more than a streak had ended.	12.911801024209794
3388. long after the erratic climate	and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological	footnotes the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the	mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player.	8.231734338405666
3389. unlike most	such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously	although this was not exactly the case.	6.882663145320025
3390. when the winter	tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to	challenge palmer's towering prestige.	10.338471946020743
3391. as if to confirm his stature	he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments.	10.932996783371784
3392. but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was	leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the	rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere.	11.258642374761
3393. on the final round at	pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same	threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery	was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of	the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.	9.077483238551027
3394. on	that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading	the tournament and as it turned out neither won it.	9.427164372307038
3395. but whichever	of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial	leader of the tour.	8.694761044798543
3396. player immediately proved he was not in the	least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer.	11.679863787425594
3397. he outplayed palmer	all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer's	71.	8.240399370137531
3398. thereafter until the masters player gradually increased	his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory	at miami.	7.870498870394593
3399. when they reached augusta last week together they had	won five of the 13 tournaments to date.	9.165310022851735
3400. on thursday	the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and	player developed instantly.	13.19355365558719
3401. it was a dismal drizzly day but a good	one on which to score over the augusta national course.	10.01661334825214
3402. the usually	skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike	their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward	the hole without too much worry about the consequences.	7.282751821335876
3403. palmer's 4-under-par	68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg.	5.316384464620528
3404. but player was only one stroke back with a 69.	18.744767970688947
3405. even	so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators-	unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament	was to be essentially a match between palmer and player.	5.179680402615714
3406. a lot	of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular	young amateur who had a 70; or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky	72 but was bound to do better; or rosburg whose accurate short	game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta's treacheries;	or even old byron nelson whose excellent 71 made one	wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.	6.314135305734676
3407. on	friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and	ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus.	6.299225835911678
3408. rosburg	had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were	on the course- separated as they were destined to be for the rest	of the weekend	by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous	scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a	73 was not having a good day.	9.075423058711184
3409. as player began his second round	in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery	was not conspicuously large for a contender.	7.1962311167888915
3410. player began with a birdie	on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie	at the 9th.	8.310237686920432
3411. on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of	a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament.	11.272497838697953
3412. he birdied	the 13th the 15th and the 18th- five birdies one bogey and 12 pars	for a 68.	8.500534276695419
3413. starting half an hour behind player in company with	british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the 2nd the	9th the 13th and the 16th- four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for	a 69.	5.574698043625613
3414. the roar of palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would	roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered	moments later by the roar of player's gallery for a similar triumph.	7.150713033893693
3415. at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a 25-foot	putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th	green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole.	8.251693824576082
3416. without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed	palmer proceeded to sink	his 25-footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling	back along the intervening fairways in reply.	8.052801990544554
3417. anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way	had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing	this most difficult golf course.	5.96636793895909
3418. it is almost axiomatic that golfers	who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots	with a vehemence bordering on violence.	11.461720712506049
3419. the bad luck that can so often	mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated	by the contemptuous boldness of these champions.	5.561401893425365
3420. bob jones played	that way.	11.62058607982087
3421. byron nelson did hogan did.	7.72439611427866
3422. and last week at the masters	palmer and player did.	13.771154749223008
3423. as the third round of the tournament	began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was player's	superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.	6.758154260704609
3424. this	day palmer had started first.	12.065286120830388
3425. as player stepped on the first tee	he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was	2 under par for the day.	8.291169848136807
3426. player immediately proceeded to follow suit.	13.740110104444598
3427. in fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under	par for the first eight holes.	9.743167013091348
3428. but player's real test came	on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.	8.352175903962243
3429. he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating	the 9th and first fairways.	7.138237369906932
3430. having hit one of the trees the ball came	to rest not more than 160 yards out.	10.65004903610565
3431. player then had the choice of	punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling	for a bogey 5 or gambling.	6.717726048889477
3432. the latter involved hitting a full	four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to	slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.	8.802518929774392
3433. i was hitting	the ball well player said later and i felt strong.	8.867355096223957
3434. when	you're playing like that you'd better attack.	5.679310736295036
3435. player attacked	with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever	forget.	6.2010234778352835
3436. it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the	edge.	13.653003820690495
3437. from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.	8.585556266303477
3438. palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles.	11.964565686671001
3439. they started on	the 4th hole a 220-yard par-3.	7.619937237811065
3440. on this day the wind had switched 180`	from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the	course was different from the previous few days.	10.136026177667958
3441. at the 4th tee palmer	chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club so	he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green.	6.271095794657829
3442. his bogey 4 on this	hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought	him back to even par.	8.710643371818945
3443. starting the second nine palmer was	already four strokes behind player and knew it.	8.174777279504045
3444. when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees' man	of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches	upon the sublime.	8.644049841806325
3445. when roger eugene maris mantle's muscular	teammate powers four home runs in a double-header his performance	merits awe.	6.413478661657008
3446. but when tiny 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the	los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center	field because as a teammate explained the other team thought	no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months	his achievement borders	on the ridiculous.	7.6362126667946955
3447. this is the year home runs	ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.	12.27196315762627
3448. it is the year when	amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the	plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented	style delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs; willie mays	of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became	the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game; the	milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs	in three games and lost two of them; and catcher johnny blanchard	of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four	successive times at bat two of them as a pinch-hitter.	7.376775868780485
3449. pitchers	grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike	zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal.	6.451447444718076
3450. experts	point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused	by expansion.	9.351522026955408
3451. whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season	produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records	home-run division.	6.87134158356703
3452. of all the records in peril one stands	apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now	doubly dramatic in its jeopardy.	9.840210351100565
3453. this of course is baseball's most	remarkable mark: the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible	epicure the incredible athlete george herman ruth of the	yankees.	6.4074232788783405
3454. since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious	runs at babe ruth's record and each in turn has been thwarted.	8.31365665114924
3455. what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth's amazing september	surge.	5.878611395129093
3456. in the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen	home runs a closing spurt never matched.	11.541247652330046
3457. always	in the abortive attacks upon ruth's record one man alone- a	jimmy foxx or a hack	wilson- made the bid.	3.444078195901344
3458. but now for the first time	since lou gehrig spurred ruth on in 1927 two men	playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60.	10.656375473234935
3459. their names are mantle	and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real.	6.532218012499035
3460. after 108 games in 1927 ruth had 35 home runs.	10.80918889151354
3461. after 108	games in 1961 mickey mantle has 43 roger maris 41.	7.813608151647059
3462. extend mantle's	and maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162	games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs.	7.361818779776352
3463. this	is the	great edge the two yankees have going for them.	7.844039722034368
3464. to better ruth's	mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish.	8.505012304876752
3465. all mantle	needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september	and he will establish a new record.	7.431430663742393
3466. in ruth's day- and until this	year- the schedule was 154 games.	5.8530878598305565
3467. baseball commissioner ford frick	has ruled that ruth's record will remain official unless it is	even on the basis of 154 games this	is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now vice-president	of the chicago white sox.	4.713908002853773
3468. it has to be easier with two of them.	23.176900841542075
3469. how can you walk maris to get to mantle?	12.350064522025333
3470. 	neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict 60 home runs	for himself.	7.853679941554153
3471. although both concede they would like to hit 60 they	stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: the	important thing is to win the pennant.	5.822094543337726
3472. but one thing is for certain:	there is no dissension between mantle the american league's	most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the mvp	in 1960.	7.914022567841533
3473. each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs	and each enjoys even more seeing himself	hit home runs.	6.215147716200896
3474. the sluggers get	along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer	they are rooming	together.	12.296522218350123
3475. mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share	an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york	international airport.	6.8076076990572965
3476. the three pay $251 a month for four rooms	with air-conditioning	and new modern furniture.	7.322284153906525
3477. mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom;	maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room.	5.915136294625475
3478. they	divide up the household chores: cerv does most of the cooking	mantle supplies the	transportation and maris drives	the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium.	6.325452724492246
3479. mantle maris and cerv probably share one major-league record already:	among them they have fifteen children- eight for cerv four	for mantle and three for maris.	4.595007146477135
3480. as roommates teammates	and home-run mates mantle 29 who broke in with the yankees ten years	ago and maris 26 who came to the yankees from kansas city	two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds.	8.369182919017804
3481. both were scholastic	stars in football basketball and baseball	; as halfbacks both came close	to playing football at the university of oklahoma	.	6.103081206947628
3482. to an extent the two even look alike.	12.079242490838517
3483. both have blue	eyes and short blond hair.	8.772796105859317
3484. both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195	and 200 pounds but mantle incredibly muscular	looks bigger.	9.087280138758619
3485. with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders	both must have their clothes made to order.	7.434083026857636
3486. maris purchases $100	suits from simpson's in new york.	6.105466529634681
3487. mantle more concerned with	dress buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and	pays as much as $250 each.	6.444363664564433
3488. neither mantle nor	maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle	has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry miller's	tropic of cancer.	7.315027891297959
3489. mantle so appreciated miller's delicate	literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive	passages aloud during road trips.	4.45041058778273
3490. mantle is not normally	given to public speaking- or for that matter to private speaking.	9.73986884747463
3491. what do you and mickey talk about at home?	12.564823655714758
3492.  a reporter asked	maris recently.	14.227320236763196
3493. to tell you the truth maris said mickey	don't talk much.	7.970514000137551
3494. this is no surprising trait for	a ballplayer.	16.996943405346908
3495. what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris	under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying	to be cooperative.	6.713152643918709
3496. of the two mantle is by nature the less	outgoing maris the more outspoken.	13.664873726486217
3497. but last week when a reporter	was standing near mantle's locker mickey walked up and volunteered	an anecdote.	6.709794851972539
3498. see that kid?	18.25727582485659
3499.  he said pointing to a dark-haired	11-year-old boy.	11.392318041078832
3500. i'll never	forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we	lost the game.	6.6482788570113405
3501. i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low	and the kid walks over to me looks up and says: 'you stunk'.	6.231675998818567
3502. maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions	candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen.	8.545194887596598
3503. when	i've made a dumb play he says i don't want to talk to	anyone.	3.8210325026255854
3504. by his own confession maris is an	angry young man.	10.44122050453541
3505. benched at tulsa in 1955 he told manager dutch meyer:	i can't play for you.	4.753440367245175
3506. send me where i can play.	11.49506194060271
3507. benched at indianapolis in 1956	he told manager kerby farrell: i'm not learning anything on	the bench.	4.483450763596102
3508. that's the way i am	he says.	4.5106434430978135
3509. i tell people what i think.	11.043988901147458
3510. if you're a good ballplayer	you've got to get mad.	6.563445506954419
3511. give me a team of nine angry men and i'll	give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of	ten times.	5.0563679636360295
3512. one good indication of the two	men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.	11.286188201503892
3513. when i was a kid maris	told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day	in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not.	7.684094555563417
3514. when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice?	14.936905599116209
3515. 	are you kidding?	8.198195792215246
3516.  said maris.	18.440193344158047
3517. you're	afraid to talk to a guy you idolize.	6.549401243750855
3518. mantle's hero was joe	dimaggio.	7.24994186127478
3519. when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman	an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio	still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker	just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this	hero of his.	5.792461698093289
3520. but dimaggio never said a word.	14.33468850262044
3521. he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this	never would be said of him.	9.774211630372639
3522. mantle has kept the vow.	14.423856622028733
3523. among all	the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.	8.630425699549598
3524. neither	mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else.	9.139944393326854
3525. if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $1 an hour	paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would	lay ties on a railroad track.	7.3222450808265
3526. if working in a zinc mine which he once	did for 87-12 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for	the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine.	9.398376646026156
3527. but since railroading	and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate	on baseball.	9.558793040708357
3528. they try to play baseball the best they can.	13.765335358540653
3529. each is a complete ballplayer.	11.61404831804323
3530. mantle beyond any question can	do more things well.	10.320687558371715
3531. says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both	hitting	mantle	has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed	maris only left-handed.	5.379862142340526
3532. they both possess near classic	stances	dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings.	9.790692521209053
3533. mantle is considerably	better hitting for average	.	9.59268219309524
3534. both are good bunters: maris	once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; mantle	is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base.	6.686544480873167
3535. both have brilliant	speed: mantle was timed from home plate to	first base in 3.	6.152693356839166
3536. 1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer; maris	ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a	race against luis aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the	white sox.	6.4181403953583995
3537. both are good daring fielders: mantle covers more	ground; maris's throwing arm is stronger.	4.514701651842579
3538. yet with all their	skills the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one	basic: the home run.	8.712612468797962
3539. with this ultimate weapon the two yankees	may have saved baseball from its dullest season.	7.038422908398515
3540. only two teams in each league	the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling	for first place.	8.976495803978013
3541. appropriately the emphasis on the home	run at a peak this year came into being at baseball's lowest moment.	6.66752146913115
3542. in 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired	to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned	and disinterested in baseball.	9.900848997146062
3543. something was needed to revive interest;	the something was the home run.	6.515767824948552
3544. into washington on president-elect john f kennedy's	convair the caroline winged actor-crooner	and his close hollywood pal cinemactor peter lawford jack	kennedy's brother-in-law.	4.6420464309832905
3545. also included in the entourage: a dog	in a black sweater frankie and peter had an urgent mission: to stage	a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital's	national guard armory.	4.222700846373254
3546. frankie was fairly glutted with ideas as	he had hinted upon his arrival: it's really tremendous when you	think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia.	5.43198526528239
3547. i could talk to	you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans!	as the plans were laid some several thousand fat cats were to	be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced	at $10000 each.	5.5142007463612455
3548. the biggest single act would doubtless be staged	by frankie himself: his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by	hollywood couturier don loper who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles.	6.177912984313158
3549. soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered	two of everything just in case he spills anything frankie	got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch	of loper clothing.	6.264601407490373
3550. a year after he was catapulted over	nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps	general delivered a peppery annual report	in the form of a happy warless new year greeting to his	pentagon staff.	9.359447731243032
3551. said leatherneck shoup: a year ago i took the	grips of the plow in my hands.	6.742440180686298
3552. after pushing an accumulation of vines	and weeds from the moldboard i lifted the lines from the dust and	found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on.	8.249213377698231
3553. little	geeing and hawing have been necessary.	7.10991296473264
3554. but shoup also gave	the corps a tilling in spots.	10.95734756282492
3555. speaking of pride he deplored	the noncommissioned officer whose uniform looks like it belonged to	someone who retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks or	the bay window.	5.465837271282123

3561. the principal of the school announced	that- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia-	fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in english and mathematics.	5.09770859508049
3562. lacking his needed credits in those subjects fabian will not	graduate with his old classmates next week.	8.258437755442978
3563. south philadelphia high's	principal added that the current delay was caused by the pressure	of a movie that the toneless lad was making.	5.9870135357008385

3576. g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards	of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe's best hotels	but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town	of pittsburgh.	8.383606352268199
3577. there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth a	reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art.	6.596220318813469
3578. last week	in the german city of du^sseldorf g david thompson was	making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause.	7.782440836562552
3579. on display were	343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-	and every single one of them was up for sale.	5.907421487757031
3580. like philadelphia's	late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection	closed to the general public thompson	at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime.	8.64982108722534
3581. he made his	fortune during world war 2 when he took over a number of dying	steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.	9.561417685845134
3582. even before he hit	big money he had begun buying modern paintings.	11.855065051448928
3583. he gave the impression	of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that	he had an eye for the best.	8.518583168504044
3584. he was able to smell a bargain-	and a masterpiece- a continent away and the museum of modern art's	alfred barr said of him: i have never mentioned a new artist	that thompson didn't know about.	5.9860532406625
3585. he might barge into a gallery	start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting.	9.645200278570824
3586. he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys	but with dealers he was tough.	10.740779317695004
3587. he bought up cezannes braques matisses	legers a splendid picasso series more than 70 giacometti	sculptures.	7.047889160444931
3588. he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees	in the world.	11.76231976546048
3589. all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone's	throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted	ever got to see them.	5.992840610161148
3590. two years ago thompson offered his	collection to the city.	14.539837247872903
3591. but he insisted that it be housed in a special	museum.	11.739531695408905
3592. pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had	been snubbing him for years.	8.960719273361356
3593. he went then to a 40-year-old basel art	dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures.	7.035557786024329
3594. last year beyeler arranged to sell $1500000 worth of klees	to the state of north rhine-westphalia which will house them in	a museum that is yet to be built.	7.554280026261829
3595. last week most of the other prizes	once offered to pittsburgh went on the block.	9.750900459348284
3596. at the opening	of the du^sseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the	treasures that he was seeing together for the last time.	9.840266088071582
3597. in fact he	seemed delighted to get rid of them.	12.5768169815027
3598. some observers speculated that	this might be his revenge on his home town.	9.375412660187644
3599. thompson himself said:	i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new	pictures.	5.947149000425197
3600. the university of georgia has long claimed that	it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis	of race or color.	10.316776964022935
3601. but in all its 175 years not a single negro	student has entered its classrooms.	9.170500876019368
3602. last week federal district judge	william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately	a qualified negro boy and girl.	9.569232607699595
3603. their entry will crack the	total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate	school in georgia- and in alabama mississippi and south	carolina as well.	4.953059573954279
3604. for 18 months hamilton holmes 19 and	charlayne hunter 18 had tried to get into the university.	12.354429438397986
3605. they graduated	together from atlanta's turner high school where valedictorian	holmes was first in the class and charlayne third.	7.422620016444004
3606. the university	rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never	to mention the color of their skins.	10.726911457194396
3607. holmes went to atlanta's morehouse	college where he is a b+ student and star halfback.	5.42377467384937
3608. charlayne studied journalism at detroit's wayne state university.	6.781091357176588
3609. last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to	court judge bootle ordered them to apply again.	7.641225584933685
3610. charlayne	was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators	questioned her white roommate at wayne state.	7.377011047992433
3611. but holmes was rejected	again on the basis of his record and interview.	10.103373632216504
3612. the evidence	in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted	an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through	this ritual by a simple phone conversation.	8.296389181686662
3613. holmes was asked if he	had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse.	6.547380881004162
3614. no said he but officials still called him evasive.	11.52755401332739
3615. they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested.	10.961447158194266
3616. their reason: holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine had his license	suspended.	5.6727537930127205
3617. negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white	students found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few	had academic records as good as hamilton holmes.	5.280441762625186
3618. the real reason	for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically	cuts off funds for any desegregated school.	9.88872034983305
3619. judge bootle's	decision: the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission	to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been	for their race and color.	5.709449348685916
3620. the state will appeal- but few think	it will actually try to close the university.	9.930340884676385
3621. surprised and pleased	students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia	this week.	6.843367299688361
3622. when the university of	chicago's chancellor lawrence a kimpton	submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt	gripped the midway.	7.923999015727139
3623. out went letters to 60000 old grads asking for	suggestions.	8.88623794135507
3624. such academic statesmen as james b conant were consulted.	10.417651366804053
3625. two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors including	adlai stevenson richard nixon and harvard's dean mcgeorge	bundy.	5.064569403334256
3626. the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither	a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather	as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it a top scholar in	his own right- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago.	7.238811476686752
3627. last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech's	acting dean of the faculty: dynamic geneticist george wells	beadle 57 who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology	for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell	chemistry.	5.134937681555567
3628. it fell to chancellor	kimpton now a standard oil executive to spend	his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of	idealist robert maynard hutchins.	6.74176970364655
3629. he threw out some of hutchins'	more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment	to 2100 nearly doubled endowment to $139.	6.182386853553504
3630. but though	kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads	feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it	in the heady hutchins era.	9.191789775061368
3631. at caltech geneticist beadle	has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology	division since 1946.	6.8269351382008665
3632. but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot	recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected	talents in fund raising and speech-making.	9.480587871080493
3633. beadle is even that rare	scientist	who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the	wall street journal and took delight in driving a $250 model a	ford for 22 years then selling it for $300.	4.697017070158054
3634. a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began	with the old adam and consequently will never end.	10.969893408616015
3635. but a historian	might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope	that the troubles will sometime pass away.	6.885394767569473
3636. the man was king leopold	2 of the belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better	grab a colony while the grabbing was still good.	10.796296328287125
3637. by force he took under	his protection or stole 900000 square miles of wilderness in central	africa.	6.935283666025441
3638. this is an area nearly as large as western europe;	and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political	or historical unity.	9.773722328445528
3639. its boundaries had nothing to do with geography	or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which leopold's	explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.	5.576280115771701
3640. the population	of the congo is 13.	14.772633061897777
3641. 5 million divided into at least seven major	culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate	dialects.	7.6979664450455605
3642. the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism	paganism ancestor worship and animism.	10.505703113915697
3643. the climate ranges from	the steamily equatorial to the temperate.	7.413922701545997
3644. the hospitals contain patients	trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars.	9.630370730779031
3645. to make one	nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any	case; it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have	done or failed to do in the congo since 1885.	8.433551235163014
3646. at first the	belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property.	12.041012525292443
3647. but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.	9.261075761830785
3648. the belgian government itself took over administration commencing	a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.	11.122052213330607
3649. one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice	on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in	the manner of a father dealing with his children.	8.988447588915378
3650. the honor of the	belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment.	12.358984069958318
3651. ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time-	but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child	if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until	then been treated as an infant.	5.688640437080071
3652. the belgians were interested	primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in	copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm	oil.	9.744282614898713
3653. the colony was administered from brussels with neither the	congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote.	6.2554859058593815
3654. the beneficiaries	of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both	individuals and the belgian government itself held stock.	9.675772355789158
3655. in inside	africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale	as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us	say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance	company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various	companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with	the united states government as a heavy partner.	6.176282192605513
3656. had	they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese	without compassion.	7.896833610308408
3657. they provided a social	security system which covered all their african employes; their program	of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent;	they put much effort into public housing.	4.8344665409122625
3658. they also instituted a ration	system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish	their employes with clothing and adequate food.	9.199333506420029
3659. but instead of	delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at	intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged	to dole it out more often.	5.314539130498699
3660. would not the children if they received all	their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and	later go hungry?	12.865195848654842
3661.    the belgians also placed great emphasis	on education.	9.628477961515411
3662. during the 1950s there were as many as 25000 schools in	the congo.	15.29394389538381
3663. but almost all the schools were primary.	14.653340746410064
3664. the average congolese	can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte	and le chien and write his name.	10.598145303321502
3665. some schools were	technical- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit	the land and trained many.	5.7316691887105735
3666. but they did not believe in widespread	secondary education much less in college.	14.018876272530628
3667. it was their conviction	that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time	until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history	economics and political science.	7.407184675444491
3668. indeed the belgians discouraged	higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite	which might cause unrest.	10.805216607137798
3669. when the congo received its independence	in 1960 there were among its 13.	8.903052195694157
3670. 5 million people exactly 14 university	graduates.	17.00556339817529
3671. why did the belgians grant independence to a	colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it?	8.232174124319458
3672.  in one large oversimplification	it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the	gale of nationalism sweeping africa.	13.183102960062694
3673. they lacked time to prepare	the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies.	8.106734629520789
3674. the	congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most	were unsure what it meant; and in brussels street crowds shouted	pas une goutte de sang!.	6.012366256802736
3675. the	belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue;	rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would	wash their hands of the mess.	6.638651180581235
3676. it is hard to blame them for this.	27.723560867417767
3677. yet	there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after	independence for which history may not find them guiltless.	6.133436783052549
3678. as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no	fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university	graduate.	12.564217903265309
3679. there were four principal ones.	16.126898611969484
3680. first there were those	congolese who favored splitting the	country into small independent states balkanizing it.	8.765055121403115
3681. second there	were those who favored near-balkanization a loose	federalism having a central government of limited authority with	much power residing in the states.	5.187538411227895
3682. third there were those	who favored a unified congo with a very strong central	government.	9.163997417938882
3683. and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry	for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up.	7.752442598452914
3684. however	the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.	9.544367816488235
3685. a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation	of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure	that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration.	7.1043449383668875
3686. they had divided the congo into six provinces- leopoldville	kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern- unfortunately	with little regard for ethnic groupings.	6.693898847431539
3687. thus some provinces contained	tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant	an opportunity for war.	7.41249327561178
3688. the belgian congo was granted its independence	with what seemed a workable western-style form of government:	there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature	elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.	7.015402553831911
3689. well-wishers	around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable	position in the society of nations.	5.790146833198977
3690. if internal frictions arose	they could be handled by the 25000-man congolese army the force	publique which had been trained and was still officered by white	belgians.	8.425537846138745
3691. the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator	and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man.	7.432670681787886
3692. twenty-four	hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting	each other.	6.592407682668979
3693. presently the well-armed members of the force publique-	many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes	erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting.	5.206608725776607
3694. terror engulfed the thousands	of belgian civilians who had remained in the country.	9.10676157708249
3695. the belgian	government decided to act and on july 10 dispatched paratroops	to the congo.	8.042940796176142
3696. on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of	katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from	the country.	9.666710685331816
3697. confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought	new acts of violence.	5.011513832380362
3698. lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military	intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations	to send troops to oust them.	10.982266287972417
3699. on july 14 the security	council-	with france and great britain abstaining- voted the resolution	which drew the un into the congo.	5.436599962963221
3700. vague in wording it	called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general	to take the necessary steps h to provide the congolese	government with such military assistance as may be necessary until	through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical	assistance of the united nations the national security forces	may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks	h.	9.110794634890006
3701. secretary-general hammarskjo^ld decided that it	would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were	to come from african or at least nonwhite nations- certainly not	from the us	russia great britain or france.	4.823052491684478
3702. he quickly	called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched	troops within hours.	8.529094661320052
3703. ultimately the un army in the congo	reached a top strength of 19000 including about 5000 from india	and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites.	6.144944267199803
3704. it took the un three months to bring a modest form of	order to the congo.	14.859154953388028
3705. the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops	and often obstructed un efforts.	8.041821410082871
3706. the wildly erratic nature	of patrice lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced	that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with	the belgians and appealed to russia for help.	9.82171446088832
3707. little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist.	7.615516888158948
3708. before appealing	to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us	lumumba further complicated	the un's mission by initiating small wars with the	secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under	albert kalonji wanted to secede as well.	7.098269080482486
3709. meanwhile russia took every	opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for	his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening	on occasion to intervene openly.	5.465460004651508
3710. but by the end of the three-month	period in october 1960 something approaching calm settled on	the congo.	11.99691085173108
3711. president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and	fired him.	7.71590512096045
3712. control of the government- such	control as there was and such government as there was- passed into	the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army.	8.655276500423982
3713. mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any	significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their	obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york.	6.709222278311111
3714. the belgians- at least officially- departed from the congo as well	withdrawing all of their uniformed troops.	7.721686730911433
3715. but they left behind	them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or	mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga	the seceded province which according to tshombe holds 65% of	the mineral wealth of the entire country.	5.990767676549912
3716. from october 1960	to february 1961 the un forces in the congo took little action.	11.036248380352623
3717. there was no directive for it- the security council's resolution	had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united	nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political	affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize	it.	6.190479544074902
3718. during the five-month lull civil war smoldered and	flickered throughout the congo.	9.87843020657457
3719. in february the murder of patrice	lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of	tshombe again stirred the un to action.	7.442629403226652
3720. on feb 21 the	council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate	measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including	h the use of force if necessary in the last resort.	10.901067846087969
3721. although	the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably	tougher than the earlier one.	7.031124929861635
3722. it also urged that the un	eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military	and political advisers; ordered an investigation of lumumba's	death; urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the	reorganization of the army.	7.925371251025133
3723. though president john	f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin	and disarmament adviser mccloy's unexpected report from khrushchev	his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved	him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week.	5.37092495402964
3724. high up on the president's priority list was the thorny question	of bizerte.	7.43985283725555
3725. on this issue the president received a detailed	report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson who had just	returned from paris and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search	for a face-saving	way- for both paris and tunis- out of the imbroglio.	5.632031739473954
3726. ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status	quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing	their forces from the mediterranean base.	9.113545620279723
3727. to continue their important	conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of	other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for	the weekend.	6.924023384622412
3728. the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with	the no 2 man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi	ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support.	9.561342598858673
3729. the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the	positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable.	7.25209557373858
3730. through ladgham	mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian	president habib bourguiba; and one us official said: the	key question now is which side picks up the phone first.	6.314057687548227
3731. on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary	of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay	and the inter-american economic and social council	.	6.222976076090303
3732. main purpose of the	meeting: to discuss president kennedy's alliance for progress.	4.732099430017782
3733. and that was not all.	19.77604149073037
3734. in conferences with nationalist china's	dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy	assured chiang kai-shek's emissary that the us is as	firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united	nations.	7.738028386868384
3735. chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission	of outer mongolia; however the president who would like to woo	the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would	promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer	mongolia's admission comes to a vote.	5.4178435990943
3736. the president	also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking	more foreign aid.	8.231791445476434
3737. to africa he sent his most trusted adviser	his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a good-will mission	to the ivory coast.	5.845889241877143
3738. all week long the president clearly was playing	a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect he was practicing	what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he	declared:	we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems	with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with	reason.	7.684537014247942
3739. from international airport	in los angeles to international airport in houston as the	great four-jet boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes	including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio.	5.210284628800232
3740. when	continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11:30 one	night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer.	9.512600823630992
3741. the plane put down on schedule at 1:35 am in phoenix.	6.889662061916692
3742. thirty-one minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly	anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention	to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard.	7.817179262816247
3743. at 3:58 am	with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert	berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the	man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward	the cockpit.	5.687019669382483
3744. the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach	berry said.	15.225592077714047
3745. i figured he was sick.	11.759883781404596
3746. john salvador a	farmer from palm desert calif was sitting up front and could	see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit.	7.844013486550979
3747. the kid had	a .	10.89473475175348
3748. 45 automatic like they issue in the army he said.	12.184670622300171
3749. the other	fellow had a .	9.917897376834304
3750. salvador saw the youth hold his .	9.86675215498729
3751. 45 against the	head of stewardess lois carnegey; the man put his .	5.569894168714838
3752. 38 at the head	of capt byron d rickards.	10.951988715066754
3753. to rickards a 52-year-old	veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story: his plane was	being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when	peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa.	5.264827019747526
3754. but	last week's pirates like the cuban-american who recently hijacked	an eastern airlines electra wanted to	go to havana.	5.115633379315117
3755. tell your company there are four	of us here	with guns the elder man told rickards.	6.148834316289673
3756. the pilot radioed	el paso international airport with just that message.	10.636245292140282
3757. but he	told the skyjackers the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach	havana; they would have to refuel at el paso.	5.0740642063820935
3758. most passengers	didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground.	10.628459591001345
3759. jerry mccauley of sacramento calif one of some twenty air force	recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion.	5.846853565161676
3760. the old man	came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers	to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand.	10.498217843660608
3761. i thought he was the air force recruiter.	15.053149468081438
3762. what the man	wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew.	10.848964738793903
3763. they chose four: jack casey who works for continental airlines	in houston; fred mullen from mercer island wash;	pfc	truman cleveland of st augustine.	4.07695906825691
3764. fla and leonard gilman	a former college boxer and veteran of the us immigration	service border patrol.	8.554243148204566
3765. everybody else was allowed to file off the	plane after it touched down at el paso at 4:18 am.	6.596971890913847
3766. they found a large welcoming group- el paso policemen border patrol	sheriff's deputies and fbi men who surged around the	plane with rifles and submarine guns.	6.707179946999533
3767. other fbi men talking with	the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed	flight to havana.	6.719767258696543
3768. the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty	minutes took fully three hours.	8.489867694930556
3769. still more time was consumed while	the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert	six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for	a propeller-driven douglas dc-7.	5.7314798823110396
3770. actually the officers	on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with	any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight	from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that	it was four followers of cuba's fidel castro who had taken over	the 707.	7.131929915192196
3771. mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the	attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone.	8.769420368238734
3772. at	one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a	cuban plot the president talked about invoking a total embargo on	trade with cuba.	9.66707563888367
3773. as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas	sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close	enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment.	6.630194116613244
3774. from the	luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans	were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden	50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge ariz and his son cody	16 a high-school junior.	6.924180944338016
3775. the heat and strain began	to tell on the beardens.	8.386012906304043
3776. the father by accident or perhaps to show	as he said we mean business took the .	10.773841813894343
3777. 45 and fired a slug	between the legs of second officer norman simmons.	7.303074882234295
3778. at 7:30 am	more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum:	take off or see the hostages killed.	6.882232345411725
3779. the tower	cleared the plane for take-off at 8 am and captain rickards	began taxiing toward the runway.	6.006330111580966
3780. several police cars loaded with	armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the	big jet.	8.113311571415299
3781. the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard	engines; the plane slowed to a halt.	5.964153892486096
3782. ambulances baggage trucks	and cars surrounded it.	8.680107857564634
3783. at 12:50 pm	a ramp was rolled up to the plane.	7.603545026111
3784. a few minutes later fbi agent	francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed.	11.275758974989566
3785. while crosby distracted the beardens stewardesses carnegey	and toni besset dropped out of a rear door.	6.583474648329351
3786. so did hostages casey	cleveland and mullen.	11.957046339904128
3787. that left only the four crew members crosby	and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens.	7.042484724279493
3788. the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket.	12.113626597761368
3789. gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance.	7.933698153890067
3790. he caught	officer simmons' eye nodded toward young bearden and- i	swung my right as hard as i could.	7.31393204507243
3791. simmons and crosby jumped the boy	and it was all over.	6.79098008518745
3792. frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48	pm the beardens were held in bail of $100000 each on charges	of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines.	5.307122180304479
3793. back home in coolidge ariz his 36-year-old wife	mary said: i thought they were going to phoenix to look for	jobs.	5.634837331499745
3794. taking precedence over all other	legislation on	capitol hill last week was the military strength of	the nation.	9.444609176632676
3795. the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed	speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime	defense budget in us history.	5.034178539883071
3796. with the money all	but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of	the 225000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested	the armed forces would be increased by only 160000.	9.77339802627605
3797. the hold-back	as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary	expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually	and thus the new funds spent prudently.	5.5417572005349935
3798. in all the senate	signed a check for $46.	16.441435509372372
3799. 7 billion which not only included the extra	$3.	9.369757212695934
3800. 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy but	tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for.	10.922891001166377
3801. senate on its own decided to provide additional b-52 and other	the house which	had passed its smaller appropriation before the president's urgent	call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense	budget in short order.	4.799780240726617
3802. in other areas congressional action last	week included:    the senate and the house	passed and sent to the white house the compromise	farm bill which the president is expected to sign not too unhappily.	10.796102166659555
3803. the senate also voted $5.	11.097335635647136
3804. 2 billion to finance the government's	health welfare and labor activities.	9.161170693625511
3805. debate on the	all-important foreign-aid	bill with its controversial long-range proposals	had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend.	4.295053899860156
3806. white house	legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.	9.944733286281082
3807. most members of the us senate	because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they	can.	8.608789830595052
3808. but because they are politicians they like to talk as poor-mouth	as the lowliest voter.	11.410752181700836
3809. as a result ever since 1851 when the senate	restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building the senators	have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they	opposed every move that might improve it.	7.043173255016279
3810. over the years enlivened	chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho	potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all-american course.	9.308166773969786
3811. individual	senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced	smelts from michigan soft-shell crabs from maryland oysters	from washington grapefruit from florida.	5.141099364164763
3812. but plain old bean soup	served daily	since the turn of the century	made clear to the citizenry that	the senate's stomach was in the right place.	9.294107250790791
3813. in a daring	stroke the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute	cuisine and hired a $10000-per-year french-born maitre d'hotel.	7.0269803325337366
3814. holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly	reports on operation of the turnpikes.	7.839730278615547
3815. long-term trend	of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward.	5.084379531102779
3816. higher toll rates	also are helping boost revenues.	9.758848543673754
3817. result is a better prospect	for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.	7.516344575895479
3818. things are looking up these days for many of the	state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road	bonds.	10.157310646398802
3819. traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.	11.524128941846147
3820. that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll	gates.	9.779040750452486
3821. as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors	who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright	speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.	7.313556397867424
3822. another	result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these	tax-exempt bonds.	8.105720228066808
3823. other tax-exempt bonds of state and local	governments hit a price peak on february 21 according to standard	+ poor's average.	5.0624563170613435
3824. on balance prices of those bonds have slipped	a bit since then.	10.760021573269434
3825. however in the same three-month period toll-road	bonds as a group have bucked this trend.	7.44774023531823
3826. on these bonds price rises	since february 21 easily outnumber price declines.	10.380386978727497
3827. investors however still see an element of more-than-ordinary	risk in the toll-road bonds.	5.342866294959703
3828. you find the evidence of that in the	chart on this page.	13.480228583149561
3829. many of the toll-road bonds still are selling	at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent	or very close to that.	7.296318680591427
3830. and this is true in the case of some turnpikes	on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which	the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on	the bonds.	11.118724008911547
3831. that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be	had on good corporation bonds.	8.659328928941102
3832. it's not much more in fact than	the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds.	5.762475226637084
3833. for	investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax-free yield	of 4 per cent is high.	5.681402909742894
3834. it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried	investor with more than $16000 of income to be taxed or for	a married couple with more than $32000 of taxed income.	10.972651637893767
3835. a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the	most recent 12-month period- ending in february or march- shows	what is happening.	5.132350694685724
3836. the report is based on a survey by blyth + company	investment bankers.	9.357167591261687
3837. nearly all the turnpikes show gains in	net revenues during the period.	9.31071897576346
3838. and there is the bright note:	the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late	in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.	13.256706380292368
3839. many	of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.	7.803727485292915
3840. indication:	the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.	5.9237040641991054
3841. look	for example at the ohio turnpike.	8.051340008992856
3842. traffic on that road slumped	sharply in january and february as compared with those same months	in 1960.	9.690030844258787
3843. then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues-	after operating costs.	7.482070482100457
3844. as a result the road's net revenues	in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest	payments on the turnpike bonds.	12.193392984167188
3845. that was up from 173 per cent	in the preceding 12 months.	8.646661464386609
3846. that same pattern of earnings shows	up on the massachusetts turnpike.	11.83937135216726
3847. operating revenues were off in	the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in march.	9.264833662000767
3848. costs were held down despite a bitter winter.	11.263840751493664
3849. for the	year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121	per cent in the preceding period.	9.2824158206218
3850. the road's engineers look for further	improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston.	8.250501173488798
3851. some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough	to prove what they can do.	7.694754657340079
3852. the 187-mile illinois state toll	highway	for example was not opened over its entire length until december 1958.	8.019114369410874
3853. in the 12 months ended in february 1960 the highway earned enough	to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid	out of initial reserves.	10.714596360799266
3854. in the 12 months ended in february 1961	this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.	22.28594889661313
3855. in the first two months of 1961 earnings of the	illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent	from early 1960.	8.233060889108305
3856. success for many turnpikes has come hard.	12.668155231443274
3857. traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.	6.809510188755508
3858. in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to	toll-rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or	better	connections with other highways.	8.995089591337319
3859. many rate increases already	have been put into effect.	9.279229679814751
3860. higher tolls are planned for july 1	1961 on the richmond-petersburg va turnpike and proposals for	increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study.	6.818866197411965
3861. progress is being made too in improving motorists' access	to many turnpikes.	6.361709601795378
3862. the kansas turnpike offers an illustration.	14.766883623466855
3863. net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements	in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb 28	1961.	10.014235973648306
3864. further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike	are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at wichita	and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in	both kansas city kans and kansas city mo.	9.152986954971547
3865. meanwhile there	appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover	the interest deficiency for eight more years.	5.497683646109081
3866. investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find	that not all roads are nearing their goals.	6.270383402354465
3867. traffic and revenues	on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners	and investors alike.	6.599728939804753
3868. if nothing is done the prospect is that that	road will be in default of interest in 1962.	12.145916723317317
3869. west virginia toll bonds	have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement	in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.	6.9582500066105855
3870. the typical picture at this	time is one of steady improvement.	14.918491711223876
3871. it's going to take time	for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in	full.	3.650463833711767
3872. already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough	to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.	10.45708571665795
3873. many others are	attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even	point.	8.377415279725112
3874. a top american official after a look at europe's	factories thinks the us is in a very serious situation	competitively.	10.796723573158314
3875. commerce secretary luther hodges	accompanied by a member of our staff on may 10 toured plants of	two of italy's biggest companies- fiat the auto producer	and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines.	5.306034968975513
3876. our staff man cabled from turin as follows-   follow	secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this:	one modern equipment- much of it supplied under the	marshall plan- enables fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day.	5.787673715721866
3877. about	half of these are exported.	9.44173197311476
3878. two wage costs are a fraction	of the us costs.	11.849190469777072

3881. fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more	than six years.	7.494185659972679
3882. said secretary hodges: 'it's a tough	combination for the us to face'.	7.99965134836573
3883. olivetti	had a special interest for hodges.	7.860164907236889
3884. olivetti took over underwood	the us typewriter maker in late 1959.	8.38429810613111
3885. within a year without	reducing wages underwood's production costs were cut one third	prices were slashed.	6.521117272079265
3886. the result has been that exports of underwood	products have doubled.	14.471246036907754
3887. the olivetti plant near turin has	modern layout modern machinery.	6.914995324183707

3891. hodges predicted: 'i think we will see more foreign firms	coming to the us.	5.395870808785612
3892. there are many places where we can use their	vigor and new ideas'.	15.396412516836286
3893. foreign competition has	become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new	ways of handling competitive imports.	6.060664505697082
3894. the recently unveiled	kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be	significant for american businessmen in many lines.	8.96801504809115
3895. important	aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these:   an	international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting	countries will be called shortly by president kennedy.	4.752203567526692
3896. chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting.	11.064910382819413
3897. the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized	countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed	countries over the years.	6.632447634275463
3898. point is that developing countries	often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to	get on their feet.	9.104787983960907
3899. if they have trouble exporting international bill	for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.	8.62097450350022
3900. idea	is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.	10.180630245237028
3901. at the same time another purpose of the conference	will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports-	especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing	countries.	5.679709014588564
3902. japan since 1957 has been voluntarily	curbing exports of textiles to the us.	9.606069554203737
3903. hong kong	india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types	of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact.	6.49485899773794

3907. the indians and pakistanis	are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for	similar reasons.	7.259348124661897
3908. the kennedy hope is that at the conference	or through bilateral talks the low-wage textile-producing countries	in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause	friction all around and may result in import quotas.	8.581385700289642
3909. gradual	controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what president	kennedy wants.	4.331290185082769
3910. this may point the way toward international stabilization	agreements in other products.	13.346152529627467
3911. it's an important clue	to washington thinking.	2.06727707295937
3912. note too that the kennedy	textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us	textile industry.	8.740313099663894
3913. get competitive or get out.	8.92724627965078
3914. in	veiled terms that's what the kennedy administration is saying to	the american textile industry.	6.774942779332861
3915. the government will help in	transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization	doesn't seem feasible.	6.810414800565162

3918. import quotas aren't ruled out	where the national interest is involved.	7.78985058170269
3919. but the kennedy administration	doesn't favor import quotas.	9.168253986623967
3920. rather they are impressed	with the british government's success in forcing- and helping-	the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to	other products.	6.253379195510745
3921. what's happening in textiles can be handwriting	on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with	imports from low-wage countries.	4.2706103940408005
3922. among the highest-paid workers	in the world are us coal miners.	10.35750229081373
3923. yet us coal is	cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.	6.289127087117845
3924. steel	company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in	virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be	able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets.	8.27380026177812
3925. virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about	$2.	7.532889535154229
3926. 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.	9.999325346392464
3927. us coal is cheap despite high wages because	of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates	on ocean freight.	5.616333080842312
3928. many of the coal seams in the nationalized british	mines are twisting narrow and very deep.	11.790346390102492
3929. productivity	of us miners is twice that of the british.	7.952756994536312
3930. welsh	coal miners communist-led are up in arms at the suggestion that	the steel company bring in american coal.	7.427247208819021
3931. the british government will have to decide whether to let	us coal in.	10.89387108978664
3932. the british coal industry is unprofitable has large	coal stocks it can't sell.	7.725984133033956
3933. every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes	beyond the five-cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian	say apologetically i'm sorry but we don't have that	book.	4.2117266039106624
3934. there wouldn't be much demand for it i'm afraid.	8.114802234058482
3935. behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget	problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest.	5.234470200313583
3936. what to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15000 book titles?	8.443090695070426
3937. 	what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and	nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when	your budget is pitifully small?	5.08280112028803
3938.  most library budgets are hopelessly	inadequate.	12.970311430363717
3939. a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually	which includes the librarian's salary and not even the new	york public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's	richest city.	4.873438513697791
3940. the plight of a small community library is proportionately	worse.	13.088103002164887
3941. confronted with this situation most libraries	either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they	can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and	local governments to supplement their annual funds.	6.246988155568219
3942. in some parts of	the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under	the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the	state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional	basis.	7.417976174737661
3943. new york state has what is probably the most advanced	of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become	a model for others to follow.	7.021864215721914
3944. because it is so large a state with	marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new	york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works.	8.776975957013372
3945. at	one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries	in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated	area.	6.853318947427573
3946. at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library	system in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly	growing territory to serve.	8.782325242656398
3947. both these types and those	in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries	that began at albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the	legislature of county library systems financed by county governments	with matching funds from the state.	6.289660838096941
3948. it was a step in the right direction	but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully	the thriving systems of today.	12.192921678042364
3949. under this law annual grants are	given to systems in substantial amounts.	7.622879841199637
3950. an earlier difficulty was	overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might	join or not as they saw fit.	10.850047572646607
3951. some library boards are wary of the	plan.	7.871112120131343
3952. a large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller	ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too	great.	10.135999036517179
3953. a small library may cherish its independence and established	ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems	radical to older members of the board.	6.364239119945874
3954. within a system however	the autonomy of each member library is preserved.	12.168208774801572
3955. the local community	maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library	program facilities and services but wider resources and additional	services become available through membership in a system.	6.746851968602881
3956. all	services are given without cost to members.	10.172622445289814
3957. so obvious are these advantages	that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state	now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day	not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to	a co-op.	8.051992537471863
3958. to set up a co-operative library system the law	requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as	the nucleus and the system is organized around it.	8.427688486457859
3959. the collection may	be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection.	9.352828119162737
3960. each system develops differently according to the area it serves	but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for	maximum efficiency.	9.38301466602579
3961. the basic state grant is thirty cents for each	person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides	an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends	a certain number of dollars.	6.818584379272753
3962. in nassau county for example	the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the	system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure	that has doubled since 1950.	10.24279011231706
3963. this system by virtue of its variety	and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.	8.51810859279934
3964. the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference	service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge	and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area.	8.953311171414747
3965. the	need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual	libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford.	6.1417083188979245
3966. nassau	is currently building a central collection of reference materials	in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100000	volumes by 1965.	8.610662667271432
3967. the major part of this collection is in the	central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five	libraries in the system designated as subject centers.	7.849985840986573
3968. basic	reference	tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization	in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries.	9.43577455700572
3969. on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york	times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound	volumes of important periodicals.	9.754085587789467
3970. the entire headquarters collection	is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.	11.335313091306837
3971. headquarters gets about 100 requests every day.	7.826217977672765
3972. it is connected	by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any	book to a system that the system itself cannot provide.	12.837910798318227
3973. the books are	carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other	libraries.	6.961050454158262
3974. each subject center library was chosen because	of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters	could then build upon.	8.398286403827974
3975. east meadow has philosophy psychology and	religion; freeport houses social science pure science and language;	history biography and education are centered in hempstead; levittown	has applied science business and literature; while hewlett-woodmere	is the repository of art music and foreign languages.	3.6919551822212138
3976. the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant	and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen	local reference service.	10.458084263832744
3977. this kind of cooperation is not	wholly new of course.	9.109462257752307
3978. public libraries in nassau county have been	lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system	enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive	basis.	8.115880683394826
3979. local libraries find too that the new plan saves	tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since	the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would	be available to an individual library.	6.783309158465263
3980. the system passes on these	savings to its members.	12.449915015299899
3981. further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping	and clerical detail as the result of central billing.	7.420064085055914
3982. books are not the only resource of the system.	13.543540511192692
3983. schools and community	groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art	and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs	and to organizations in member communities.	5.870922549458743
3984. the most recent film	catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the	collection any of which may be borrowed without charge.	9.223570774916988
3985. this catalogue	lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults	although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook	of the north the emperor's nightingale and the	red balloon.	5.292196728939736
3986. workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual	consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective	use of film as a library service.	7.243244199981989
3987. the system well understands	that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children	and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian	at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned	library activities cooperating with the children's librarians	in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops	and frequent visits.	4.148992401512966
3988. headquarters has also set up a central juvenile	book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of	purchasing and selection.	7.238316516956164
3989. sample copies of new books are on display	at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in	workshop groups.	6.076822238612912
3990. story hours pre-school programs activities with	community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province	of the children's consultant.	6.244345037113124
3991. headquarters of the nassau	system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand	beyond its boundaries.	6.39725572040732
3992. in addition to the interlibrary loan service	and the children's program headquarters has a public relations	director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library	service in the county; it prepares cooperative displays	for use in member	libraries; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays	already created and used; and it publishes sum and substance	a monthly newsletter which reports the system's activities to	the staffs and trustees of member libraries.	5.893414191752738
3993. the system itself is governed	by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership.	9.613458183259553
3994. in nassau as in other systems the long-range objective	is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and	on adult education in general.	9.994260953799467
3995. librarians a patient breed of men	and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results	today.	6.620684417444293
3996. library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers	are those maligned americans the teen-agers.	9.147926554647565
3997. to them especially	the librarians with the help of co-ops hope they will never have to	say i'm sorry we don't have that book.	4.099506185752661
3998. today more than ever before the survival of our free society	depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned.	11.04355399669792
3999. the	great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our	own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western	world.	7.180276256924798
4000. the need for lifetime reading is apparent.	18.083852934607272
4001. education must not	be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our	entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation	can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.	6.862061398038586
4002. the desire	and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life.	10.924573656721828
4003. we	cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not	discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we	do read.	7.229249646911128
4004. we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific	age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint	that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom	absorbed from the written word.	11.227805275304785
4005. a fundamental source of knowledge	in the world today is the book found in our libraries.	8.47265256530686
4006. although	progress has been made in america's system of libraries it still	falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that	are needed for an informed america.	8.997876909343484
4007. the problem grows in intensity	each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge	to the written word continue to expand.	6.122071861774532
4008. the inadequacy of our	library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct	this condition.	9.578486515394955
4009. there are for example approximately 25000000	people in this country with no public library service and about 50000000	with inadequate service.	9.288330960789475
4010. in college libraries 57 per cent of the	total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed	last year by the us office of education.	10.108545974073646
4011. and over 66 per	cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any	library at all.	8.038732189072421
4012. in every aspect of service- to the public	to children in schools to colleges and universities- the library	of today is failing to render vitally needed services.	7.18101024094856
4013. only public	understanding and support can provide that service.	8.365811494972212
4014. this is	one of the main reasons for national library week april 16-22 and	for its theme: for a richer fuller life read!	the general assembly which	adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle	from the day it convened.	7.056924303134201
4015. it was faced immediately with a showdown	on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the	governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.	7.68515749476028
4016. there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in	which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers.	10.91491973970606
4017. the	final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening	budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information	they need.	7.262557549683186
4018. long-range planning of programs and ways to finance	them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid	crisis-to-crisis government.	10.096167643083598
4019. this session for instance may have	insured	a financial crisis two years from now.	7.664601821227189
4020. in all the turmoil	some good legislation was passed.	16.629605089974163
4021. some other good bills were lost	in the shuffle and await future action.	6.601337045215571
4022. certainly all can applaud passage	of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher	pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility	for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate	as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the	road maintenance bond issue.	9.165827508665837
4023. no action has been taken however	on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification	of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks	sales.	6.7850299615074645
4024. only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal	question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.	10.158878433161185
4025. the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations	questions.	12.453893380096334
4026. fortunately it spared us from the usual spate	of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like	anything but the empire state of the south.	11.120676764804173
4027. we congratulate	the entire membership on its record of good legislation.	8.951169353094265
4028. in the	interim between now and next year we trust the house and senate will	put their minds to studying georgia's very real economic fiscal	and social problems and come up with answers without all the political	heroics.	9.037949473517022
4029. the	league of women voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting	financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive.	5.877909903193944
4030. it's a	good use of money.	2.9982364107088486
4031. these women whose organization grew out of	the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson's dictum	that one must cherish the people's spirit but keep alive their	attention.	4.426533333480317
4032. if once they become inattentive to the public	affairs jefferson said you and i and congress and assemblies	judges and governors shall all become wolves.	9.102495428850544
4033. newspapermen	and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention	and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs.	7.20518546478757
4034. the league	workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and	make them available to the public.	9.806273491003479
4035. the harder the choice the more willing	the league is to wade in.	8.106333666498331
4036. and the league takes a stand with great	regularity on the side of right.	14.875129390076014
4037. industrial progress	cities and counties interested in industrial	development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled	toward the 13 northwest	georgia counties that are members of the coosa	valley area planning and development commission.	7.41658825990022
4038. coupling	its own budget of $83750 with a $30000 state grant authorized by	gov vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in march with	georgia tech.	5.979532492927115
4039. then a full-time planning office will be established	in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff	for development of an area planning and industrial development program.	5.070987272809656
4040. the undertaking has abundant promise.	12.62462684628176
4041. it recognizes the fact	that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding	together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than	through the go-it-alone approach.	5.682884573117254
4042. states defense	the rusk belief in balanced defense replacing	the	dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that	has existed.	7.318522411358393
4043. the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs	would deter russia's use of hers; that theory was and is	sound.	4.625242497762485
4044. the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence	was enough.	12.176701679223617
4045. by limiting american strength too much to nuclear	strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war	besides a nuclear war.	7.0268033926848625
4046. this strategy heightened the possibility that	we would have a nuclear war.	11.725773220410856
4047. it also weakened our diplomatic	stance because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear	war except in the ultimate extremity.	8.647225033383494
4048. this left the soviets	plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable	impunity.	7.651213869788767
4049. by maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing	american military forces to fight conventional wars too secretary	of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more	muscle and greater safety into our military position.	5.6364875744341685
4050. shows county is on beam	dekalb's budget for 1961 is a record	one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.	8.517282514422893
4051. it includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation	of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed-up	industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential	services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and	road maintenance.	5.911601533139489
4052. that such expansion can be obtained without	a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal	planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by chairman	charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust	he was given was well placed and other county officials.	11.140711300832637
4053. somebody is bound to love us	g mennen williams is learning	the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly.	6.323495448446834
4054. touring africa the new	us assistant secretary of state observed africa should be	for the africans and the british promptly denounced him.	8.105101822692665
4055. then he	arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying american	imperialists go home.	6.410910571043073
4056. backs confidence with dollars	confidence in the state's economic	future is reflected in the georgia power company's record construction	budget for this year.	5.788745465617943
4057. the firm does a large amount of	research and its forecasts have meaning.	8.846571725939171
4058. it is good to know that georgia	will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet	the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of	industrialization.	11.592038482289093
4059. georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost	from the general assembly in the form of a $1750000 budget increase	for the milledgeville state hospital.	4.921848762819445
4060. actually it amounts	to $1250000 above what the institution already is receiving considering	the additional half-million dollars gov vandiver allocated	last year from the state surplus.	7.212468425291047
4061. either way it sounds like	a sizable hunk of money and is.	9.952214160490849
4062. but exactly how far it will go toward	improving conditions is another question because there is so much that	needs doing.	12.774557834114258
4063. the practice of charging employes for meals whether	they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.	7.763767841616632
4064. the work week	of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be	reduced.	10.3510344089799
4065. more attendants nurses and doctors should be hired.	8.531397200892478
4066. patients deserve more attention than they are getting.	9.999935801817024
4067. even with	the increase in funds for the next fiscal year georgia will be spending	only around $3.	8.697331572960344
4068. 15 per day per patient.	16.013517611636455
4069. the national average is	more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental	health field to be too low.	7.22297905257334
4070. kansas regarded as tops in the nation in	its treatment of the mentally ill spends $9 per day per patient.	9.62358079195212
4071. georgia has made some reforms true.	11.079479626238243
4072. the intensive treatment program	is working well.	11.458686872936193
4073. but in so many other areas we still are dragging.	12.787245586472578
4074. considering what is being done compared to what needs to be	done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning	toward making the best possible use of the increase granted.	10.339152192616808
4075. the	boost is helpful but inadequate.	7.692672920780545
4076. assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive	to men of good conscience.	9.113828584543548
4077. rafael trujillo the often-blood thirsty	dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years perhaps deserved	his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history.	4.810347758638811
4078. but whether the murder	of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people	of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.	9.55786822286126
4079. trujillo knew a great deal about assassination.	11.80589143173408
4080. the responsibility	for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus	maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york	has been laid at his door.	8.351143131951183
4081. he had been involved in countless schemes	to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such	as president romulo betancourt of venezuela.	7.473708058631133
4082. it was a sort of poetic	justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow	the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican	arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has	been uncovered and quashed.	10.572199219572182
4083. the recent history of the dominican	republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly	benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive.	9.587122108309453
4084. unquestionably	trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved	public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and	investment and raised the standard of living notably.	7.0664187548806146
4085. but the price	was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.	9.22073226648451
4086. el benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth.	7.577252506542248
4087. the jails were	filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his	displeasure.	7.152848959815322
4088. he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states	and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his	influence extended even to congress.	10.096166633490293
4089. until the last year or so	the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article	of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession	was accepted here as evidence of his good character.	7.894428909885882
4090. tardily the government	here	came to understand how this country's own reputation was	tarnished by the association with repression.	7.618161650825954
4091. last year after trujillo	had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the	united states and many other members of the organization of american	states broke diplomatic relations with him.	8.32664278632501
4092. thereupon followed	a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines.	8.88217753125735
4093. trujillo's	dictatorship had been along conservative right-wing lines.	4.690769975586436
4094. but	after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist	slogans.	9.0034296635209
4095. there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with	castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo- thus	illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.	7.6554627649428255
4096. what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle.	12.680894620747397
4097. the	dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little	freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been	suppressed.	6.0408362580800725
4098. perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but	the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.	10.818706170639468
4099. the dominican	republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily	as toward western freedom.	5.570590704871681
4100. such a twist would be a tragedy for	the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear.	9.69032731944877
4101. for that	reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative	government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy	and help.	7.098070219328392
4102. high-speed buses on the george	washington memorial parkway operating between downtown washington	and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute	an	alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency	can do for this city.	6.683822992708201
4103. in presenting plans for such express buses	before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta	c darwin stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for	the projects his agency will soon be launching.	6.296813379118182
4104. such support should	not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta	are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into	the downtown area.	8.74158938771511
4105. because the buses would not stop on the	parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed.	7.520293643864367
4106. the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose	from the present session of congress.	9.614091038053026
4107. the inference has been too	widely	accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades	across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of	that living city.	6.836235890671262
4108. so far as the record is concerned the western	powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.	14.111732823174655
4109. though walter	ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east	germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of	east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone.	6.02719523092344
4110. the wartime protocol of september 12 1944 designated a special greater	berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint	occupation.	8.876522960585538
4111. it was not a part of any one of the three	zones for occupation by soviet american british and french troops	respectively.	13.350970767516873
4112. after the berlin blockade and airlift the council	of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the	effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin.	9.464596298677886
4113. for some time the communists honored the distinction	between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin	by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas.	8.470408005999776
4114. then they moved	offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin	and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany.	11.819272156156716
4115. that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border	have not	been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which	britain	france and the united states sent to moscow after the latter's	gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other	west german officials to west berlin.	6.8292940971240785
4116. the chancellor had as	much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin- and was certainly	less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard	eisler.	6.329132254513447
4117. the british and other replies to that moscow note	pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to integrate east	berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting	to make it the capital of east germany.	8.470988572299296
4118. they insisted on	the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a quadripartite	status.	12.788956672224446
4119. this is far from acknowledging or recognizing	those efforts as an accomplished fact.	10.029370810271617
4120. there remains of course the	question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent	the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.	10.879234597564391
4121. one ground	of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over	into west berlin as communist vopos try to gun down fleeing	unarmed residents.	6.1408426733257055
4122. another remained when an american army car was	recovered but with a broken glass.	9.289043229221102
4123. the glass may seem trivial but communist	official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed.	7.09123080580439
4124. remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the	west german misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped	that	the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy's	representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future	indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed.	8.073498946263374
4125. national park	thousands of buffalo	grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug	upon the rolling dusty-green grassland.	4.589509785048982
4126. a horizon even and seamless	binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.	7.477315613389642
4127. that	picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of	those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any	later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood.	6.289777978585531
4128. for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the	endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans	the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the	ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill.	10.253539111349523
4129. the national	park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county	northeast kansas as a prairie national park.	7.0033048175625865
4130. there the	buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth-eaten zoo	specimens.	12.212227850554484
4131. wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.	6.60165757322145
4132. grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn-	as the first settlers saw them.	5.93331542842604
4133. the park service makes	an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new	park.	6.714070694369224
4134. american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to	approve.	9.937695824965818
4135. a philadelphia distiller is currently	breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising	on tv and radio.	5.2435695391566775
4136. starting with small stations not members of	the national association of broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking	to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.	7.276104332924305
4137. probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional	action requiring the federal communications commission	to ban such advertising through its licensing power.	6.55971209731401
4138. the national	association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor	commercials.	12.086169641859048
4139. past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this	policy.	6.328021836062518
4140. even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific	prohibition.	14.625334317447663
4141. why then with these voluntary barricades and	some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional	action?	7.206939268319257
4142.  simply because the subverting action of firms that are	not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv	stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread.	10.043015106453764
4143. soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want	to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly	from the efforts of non-code competitors.	7.262585928993176
4144. although the	false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly	no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv	soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference	between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him	into downing bourbon.	5.427060186067347
4145. choice	registered democrats in new york city this year have	the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for mayor and	other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.	6.612500824815363
4146. in the central contest that for mayor they may have found	some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.	11.584865006676885
4147. mayor robert f wagner must as his opponents demand assume	responsibility for his performance in office.	6.940554707615381
4148. while all citizens	share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious	problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies.	8.168654337158973
4149. the	mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.	7.395313011642921
4150. state controller arthur levitt on the other hand cannot effectively	deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders	who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than	in the city's welfare.	9.705997716657675
4151. they too have links with the city's	ills.	10.974293775642458
4152. both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.	12.11387525703645
4153. mayor	wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed	than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence	in his more protected state post.	4.911996412150009
4154. as mayor mr levitt	might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters	would like.	12.728504667842873
4155. his election on the other hand would unquestionably	strengthen the regulars.	10.783034654693642
4156. mr wagner might or might	not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of	the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses.	10.594316381656183
4157. these	are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected	to seek the independent vote.	7.159568917905474
4158. but his reelection would strengthen	the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him.	10.810735547788687
4159. if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish	it nevertheless must be made.	8.54439613967306
4160. the vote still gives citizens a voice	in the operation of their government and their party.	11.566338995082655
4161. both mr k's have so far continued	to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos.	5.415296232915697
4162. president	kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to	be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow.	8.018023372499226
4163. but at the same	time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the	fighting.	9.14819726641946
4164. and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless is	trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian	or thai seato forces.	9.14292998647075
4165. for mr kennedy speaking	softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad	situation.	8.615663331657618
4166. the new president is in no position to start out his dealings	with moscow by issuing callable bluffs.	11.52101247525975
4167. he must show at the outset	that he means exactly what he says.	9.848034523281173
4168. in this case he has put	the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time.	15.060681044991576
4169. at	his press conference mr kennedy said all we want in laos	is peace not war h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn.	6.231415105025582
4170. at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in	unprovocative but ready position.	11.658054830243197
4171. since laos is of no more purely	military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this	approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment.	9.372239021041402
4172. but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in	laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course	that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog washington	in a tactical mess.	11.153431413725139
4173. as wars go laos is an extremely	little one.	8.972709992531353
4174. casualties have been running about a dozen men a day.	10.72892346669614
4175. the	hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2000	tough viet minh guerrilla fighters.	4.831325127698724
4176. but for the united states and	its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested	government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th'-wisp	terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners.	8.282320766137271
4177. but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he	will not really get much enjoyment from watching this	braddock-against-the-indians	contest it will probably be the fact that seato	forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that moscow has something	to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations	with washington.	6.625084995822535
4178. fortunately both the republicans and america's	chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos	aim of the president.	7.324144232638708
4179. actually it would be more accurate to say that	the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british	policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining	table.	8.84121729172395
4180. it is ironic that washington is having to struggle	so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.	13.544621629462068
4181. the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after	the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington backed the	rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma.	6.879546962617193
4182. but	since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist	position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire	patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of	interested powers.	8.376616617010043
4183. the road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof	laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.	5.932430751283645
4184. but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the	laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority	now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that	country from the cold war had to be made.	8.90849224179243
4185. the world awaits mr khrushchev's	choice of alternatives.	8.142199337343628
4186. the senate's overwhelming vote to support locally controlled	educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower	house.	7.3519900390075055
4187. twice previously the senate has approved measures backing	etv and the house has let them die.	7.561088504045302
4188. but this year prospects	may be better.	16.943472075435203
4189. the house communications subcommittee is expected to	report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.	7.656109686153791
4190. this year's senate measure would provide each state and the	district of columbia with $1000000 to be used in support of private	state or municipal etv efforts.	7.077704583480233
4191. the funds would be used	for equipment not for land buildings or operation.	7.551632628713151
4192. the relatively	few communities that have educational stations have found them	of considerable value.	9.401589299008378
4193. but lacking money from commercial sponsors the	stations have had	difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.	6.630780600215997
4194. other communities- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill-	have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial	cost of equipment.	7.531409078887123
4195. sam rayburn was a good man	a good american and third a good democrat.	7.960599475153735
4196. he was all	of these rolled into one sturdy figure; mr speaker mr sam	and mr democrat at one and the same time.	8.966787932858843
4197. the house was	his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative	then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which	he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second	most powerful man in washington.	7.5067185432264765
4198. mr rayburn was not an easy	man to classify or to label.	11.675141662833385
4199. he was no flaming liberal yet the new	deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him.	8.330340572619715
4200. he was	not a rear-looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will	miss him as much as any.	9.400338283220316
4201. two of the vital qualities demanded	of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence	and that he keep his word.	7.093972971682384
4202. sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with	him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once	given was not subject to retraction.	9.50095313510801
4203. it might be added that as he kept	his word so he expected that others keep theirs.	10.292504159562027
4204. the demonstration	of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical.	11.223322327586267
4205. his leadership	was not for audiences.	8.843288975556158
4206. a growl a nod was usually enough.	11.712963770156724
4207. when it	was not one of the great dramas of washington would be presented.	9.485767053100464
4208. he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his	hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative	chatter would subside into silence.	12.911463804071026
4209. he spoke briefly sensibly	to the point and without oratorical flourishes he made good plain	american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted	upon it.	6.995950723347542
4210. these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn	normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before	an issue reached its test on the house floor.	7.60928594761579
4211. he expected democrats	to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them.	9.486213115207084
4212. with	his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political	leader.	9.558231618021342
4213. he was of course in the house for a very long	time.	17.679447828473585
4214. there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn	voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917.	14.21947126745538
4215. to	almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the	existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house.	8.591979902828685
4216. and it was the house he loved.	22.85031753284994
4217. to be presiding officer of it was the	end of his desire and ambition.	9.920678143711308
4218. the senate to him was not the upper	body and he corrected those who said he served under the	president.	11.24992384147763
4219. sound the roll of those	with whom he served and who preceded him in death.	6.922827984206723
4220. woodrow wilson	with whom he began his years in washington warren g harding	calvin coolidge fdr with whom he managed a social revolution.	9.145595308152542
4221. and those still with us herbert c hoover harry s truman	dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy.	6.988971488178937
4222. he was	a fighter for those of his own party.	14.137200557112772
4223. mr truman has only to recall	the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan	he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would	have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there.	6.547638649776799
4224. as it	was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.	10.768808281938744
4225. with republican presidents he fought fair.	9.981666343138036
4226. he was	his own man not an automatic obstructionist.	12.083480866337716
4227. he kept his attacks	on republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game	he	was born to play.	9.118136194173239
4228. under any name- mr speaker mr	democrat mr sam- he was a good man.	7.357435467196182
4229. thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the	cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent	death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends.	7.517201148825768
4230. in 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that	jungle.	11.54259276221438
4231. simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the	bodies and tossed the remains into the river.	6.167201747691399
4232. the excuse was offered	for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries.	10.600926023058467
4233. in other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central	government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause	of dissident katanga.	7.835813668785143
4234. does this suggest that the congo	is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever	toward its goal of so making it?	9.900818218517466
4235.  to the contrary through the past	six	weeks violence has been piled upon violence.	8.513154707062771
4236. mass rapes troop mutinies	uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures	given no sanction by any political authority have become almost	daily occurrences.	6.712183548355437
4237. yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is	not the work of katanga.	8.250188066080465
4238. it happens in the territory of the leopoldville	government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable	of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un	support gives it.	9.313009427078812
4239. the main question raised by the incident is	how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo	problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in	present terms?	7.24751275988162
4240.  the probable answer is that it will do so just as long	as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african	nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting	ruin on central africa.	10.490424373048333
4241. right now they are pushing	a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate	katanga.	6.9306291593929
4242. that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several	points of view.	8.290591321899448
4243. the un army is too weak too demoralized for	the task.	9.027361491351268
4244. further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it	is now garrisoned.	9.830863000826175
4245. last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one	reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos.	7.312832323304418
4246. the congo	should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence.	12.543722684463983
4247. the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed	over wisdom.	8.403315777346686
4248. it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because	it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism.	13.939140828143184
4249. but if	any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it	is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and	urge some new approach.	8.267208458690007
4250. otherwise un will march blindly on to	certain defeat.	9.655550721711462
4251. a recent editorial discussing	a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific	co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized	on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.	6.660571355818458
4252. the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that	the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed	40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction	in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year.	9.070119941355989
4253. our comment	was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that	sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such	an agreement.	6.298767991091803
4254. the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad	had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but	that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.	9.02267593263214
4255. additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad	gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.	7.546119676379798
4256. also normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision	more or less academic.	8.848825955197764
4257. the situation with regard to the southern	pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable	to other situations in other industries.	8.327051207434335
4258. the solution reached in	the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally	included in a series of union demands.	11.092624874697226
4259. time was when the house of delegates	of the american bar association leaned to the common sense	side.	8.094878391175968
4260. but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of	the bar and when the lads met in st louis it was not to grumble	about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations	was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and	there.	10.254819753214669
4261. it was the brief writers decided man's best hope	for a peaceful and law abiding world.	7.163866175356736
4262. peace it's wonderful and	world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international	covenant extending it into space before the russians put	some claim jumper on the moon?	4.663212458983375
4263.    meanwhile in moscow khrushchev	was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build	a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt to knock	sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice	of surrendering west berlin to communism.	5.558759624695706
4264. a nuclear pacifier	of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger	than anything the united states has triggered experimentally- would	certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks khrushchev might	use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st	louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.	7.595080955264343
4265. while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed	an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in	the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.	6.336382716277649
4266. fools	he bayed what do you think you are doing?	12.288771532224672
4267.    the	only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't	playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations but	perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this	feeble effort.	7.418450354918622
4268. another evidence of the spreading rule of reason	was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american	plane by a demented algerian with a gun.	7.953333338365838
4269. the craft made the familiar	unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro	rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian	foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old ten o'clock	shadow.	6.410393986467095
4270. the plane was sent back to the united states for	a change but castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable	recruit to the revolution.	11.63255089461473
4271. less respect for the legal	conventions was displayed by castro's right hand man che guevara	who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting	in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined	from the united states embassy at caracas venezuela.	4.680716480236979
4272. the contents	were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand	to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.	8.44658841386473
4273. perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing	american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration	can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own	incompetence in protecting american interests these things would	not happen.	6.422166977366177
4274. the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion	mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not	symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious	khrushchev.	9.787413038629543
4275. pass the iron rations please and light another	candle for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read	a bit of world law just to pass the time away.	4.542876226800982
4276. again	the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission	has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates	on grain as they had planned to do this month.	9.443264236323284
4277. the request for	lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent	a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which	it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional	smaller car.	6.737950137252922
4278. by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and	its	associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have	lost to truckers and barge lines.	10.254734675166103
4279. the board's action shows	what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.	5.4687141318990475
4280. word of dag hammarskjold's death	in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.	7.13506593967624
4281. as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace and	his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously.	13.436147648612947
4282. it was	on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold	war issues.	15.17318302902472
4283. his firm hand will be desperately missed.	8.356195552708291
4284. mr	hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace.	10.710616043773406
4285. he had sought	talks with moise tshombe the secessionist president of congo's katanga	province where recent fighting had been bloody.	6.148799762164109
4286. he earnestly	urged a cease-fire.	15.719840866353211
4287. the story of the fatal crash is not fully	known.	12.861957229189622
4288. the un-chartered plane which was flying from the conference	city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun	bullets last weekend and was newly repaired.	6.872526441905019
4289. whether this or	overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.	8.489816740397677
4290. the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations'	most controversial leader.	12.168022218950036
4291. he was controversial because he was uncompromising	for peace and freedom with justice.	9.699774591674743
4292. he courageously defended	the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the	savage attacks of the communist bloc.	9.441786433130932
4293. the congo in whose cause	he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs.	10.19429055791923
4294. his policies	had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war	and workable solutions were beginning to take shape.	7.8713021058924
4295. when the recent	katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold despite	the danger flew to exert a calming influence.	7.073749627418701
4296. he gave his life	for his beliefs.	16.73901764656986
4297. the un session scheduled for today	will meet under the cloud of his passing.	8.140410568020167
4298. it is a crucial session with	the world on the edge of momentous developments.	16.884820365083183
4299. if the manner	of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication	the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason	and justice.	8.033358603296934
4300. that is the hope of mankind.	22.302773187066116
4301. reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community	has long been one of greater miami's hardest tasks.	6.298491355672289
4302. too	many have bogged down in bickering.	10.792816469944464
4303. even when public bodies arrived at	a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual.	7.7368843210140135
4304. so	we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.	8.99306672549499
4305. all nine members of	the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody + company's	proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.	3.7518812546555154
4306. the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms	of its contract.	10.22594664964298
4307. if the indenture is accepted the authority will	proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue.	7.8688668010285125
4308. then goodbody	will hand over a minimum of $15.	12.885684564031473
4309. 5 million for developing the spacious	graves tract to house the center.	10.212687056369651
4310. the next step awaits	approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade	county port authority.	13.469013124245809
4311. they allotted $500000 three years ago to	support interama until its own financing could be arranged.	6.107977875249537
4312. less than	half the sum has been spent since the interama board pinched pennies	during that period of painstaking negotiations.	8.333521383631181
4313. the balance is being	budgeted for the coming year.	9.580988526415588
4314. unanimity on interama is not	surprising.	10.944336866358283
4315. it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly	everyone is agreed.	13.349274799487176
4316. the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim	of $8.	12.459342589345873
4317. 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project.	11.276493572735205
4318. county officials have cooperated consistently.	11.566842664821774
4319. so have the people's	elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.	8.116708774777765
4320. interama	as it rises will be a living monument to greater miami's	ability	to get together on worthwhile enterprises.	7.855110134566313
4321. a good one	progress or lack of it toward civil rights in	the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued	last week by the united states commission on civil rights.	7.654774856510427
4322. much happened in this field during the past 12 months.	15.384437565891528
4323. each state	advisory committee documented its own activity.	7.620196837085129
4324. some accounts are quite	lengthy but florida's is the shortest of all requiring only four	paragraphs.	7.287899687417975
4325. the established pattern of relative calm in the	field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this	group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south	floridians william d singer and john b turner of miami.	5.494197593624928
4326. no complaints or charges have been filed during the past	year either verbally or written from any individual or group.	8.640388624537126
4327. the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed	in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in	its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from	time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights.	7.267370529390699
4328. problems	have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most	cases with understanding and restraint.	8.321062920180346
4329. the progress reported by the	advisory committee is real.	9.278134171149423
4330. while some think we move too fast and others	too slowly florida's record is a good one and stands out among	the 50.	7.862864614509578
4331. west germany will	face the crucial tests that lie ahead on berlin and unification with	a coalition government.	6.640561382849032
4332. this is the key fact emerging from sunday's	national election.	16.071527416027386
4333. chancellor adenauer's christian democratic	party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough	to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957.	5.473423837385539
4334. in	order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival	parties which gained strength.	13.633941052560333
4335. inevitably this means some compromise.	8.76279454012333
4336. the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired.	10.505336594659965
4337. both	willy brandt's social democrats who gained 22 seats in the	new parliament and the free democrats who picked up 23 will insist	on that before they enter the government.	5.329228881460233
4338. moon-faced ludwig	erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership	long denied him.	6.681809515404759
4339. if he becomes chancellor dr erhart would	make few changes.	9.408646665229044
4340. the wizard who fashioned west germany's astonishing	industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise.	7.9264773003125155
4341. he is dedicated	to building the nation's strength and as are all west germans	to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany.	5.586521350236594
4342. what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the	voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.	12.228013281524705
4343. if the party of adenauer and erhart with 45 per cent of the vote	approaches the party of willy brandt which won 36 per cent the result	would be a stiffening of the old resolve.	9.46071506838701
4344. west berlin's mayor	brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his	city and won votes by it.	6.913312222136213
4345. the free democrats	believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with	the soviet union and more dealings with the communist bloc.	8.429141013417654
4346. the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly	toward more firmness or more flexibility.	10.1825787519974
4347. it could go either	way since the gains for both points of view were about the same.	9.005133634035907
4348. regardless of the decision two facts are clear.	13.342649395951897
4349. west germany with	its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains	firm with the free nations.	6.52823306047572
4350. and the career of konrad adenauer	who upheld germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which	bismarck	began draws near the end.	6.934313664786979
4351. americans	are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing	and sometimes amusing.	5.878146969492074
4352. but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't	want to make a spectacle of himself.	13.742832602706155
4353. for instance so-called	conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting	in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took	root.	6.779523730066823
4354. one specific example is a secret fraternity which	will coordinate anti-communist efforts.	9.085266977756135
4355. the principle is commendable	but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get	gulled.	9.892834117117681
4356. according to the chicago tribune news service	state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series	of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization	seeking his money and his name:  does it assail schools	and churches with blanket accusations?	7.482415287586882
4357.   does it attack other	traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?	8.205016787652898
4358. 	does it put the label of un-american or subversive on	everyone with whom it disagrees politically?	6.9161221080946165
4359.   does it attempt	to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars	communism depression and other troubles of the world?	7.0733795921514035
4360.   does	it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone	calls and letter writing campaigns?	7.747525665512698
4361.   do its spokesmen	seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the	principles they purport to advocate?	9.271145895092385
4362.    in some instances a seventh	question can be added:  does the organization show an	affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition	or preference to the american system?	8.363043721530333
4363.    if the would-be	joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists	who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic	apprehensions of americans in a troubled time.	7.450660006914602
4364. falling somewhere	in a category between einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult	to see but undeniably there nevertheless- is the tropical green	city of islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost	no residents limited access and an unlimited future.	5.530851761923707
4365. the latter is	what concerns us all.	9.87178624662667
4366. whatever land you can see here from the north	tip end of elliott key looking southward belongs to someone- people	who have title to the land.	8.326167161161713
4367. and what you can't see the land	underneath the water belongs to someone too.	6.850865337920055
4368. the only	real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water	land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater	land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.	9.021546597699926
4369. in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developers	of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.	7.196694777799777
4370. in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share	is protected.	12.80017134270621
4371. and until this protection is at least as concrete as	say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach	those who represent us all should agree to nothing.	6.505431687025937
4372. the reaction of certain city council members to	california's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.	7.799548198041142
4373. we had assumed that at least this local legislative	body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making	the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available	to the public.	7.2374719303499555
4374. in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes	collectively known as the brown act the legislature declares that	the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies	in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.	9.865787592736819
4375. it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and	that their deliberations be conducted openly.	9.744406035941655
4376. the people	of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve	them.	10.39000318079432
4377. the people in delegating authority do not give their public	servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and	what is not good for them to know.	10.573250224330055
4378. the full implementation of	these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of	the legislature.	10.836686214088457
4379. since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting	guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not	until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining	loopholes in the brown act.	6.605917180905096
4380. despite the lip service paid by	local governments the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted	by reservations and rationalizations.	7.125287788891278
4381. when all else fails it	is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.	8.160045355120658
4382. we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one	of its principal aims.	11.43605849084589
4383. without public scrutiny the deliberations	of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily.	6.199426788920172
4384. but the	citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted	were as correct as they were expeditious.	11.462668961457357
4385. if the dominican republic achieves	free democratic government it will be due in large part to the us	show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened	restoration of trujillo dictatorship.	8.25546323023501
4386. outwardly ciudad	trujillo is calm.	10.335187695915293
4387. none of the trujillo family remains.	12.833315673182849
4388. mr	balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse	to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections	in the spring.	9.339275763206365
4389. had us warships not appeared off	the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would	now be wracked by civil war.	6.599628198055604
4390. ultimately either the trujillos would	have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions	favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro	in cuba.	8.095963842695006
4391. within the organization of american states	there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention	which was not without risk obviously.	7.469161972466275
4392. but there was no complaint from	the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo's waterfront	shouting vive yankees! more the us action was hailed	by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch as having saved	many lives and many troubles in the near future.	7.749164625320705
4393. mr	balaguer's troubles are by no means over.	6.207944271220224
4394. he will need the help	of all oas members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism	pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike.	8.863306868031929
4395. in cooperating toward	that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness	demonstrated by the united states.	8.712966446456647
4396. those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial	unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor	split in 1935.	10.023618058776524
4397. now as then it is a matter of jobs.	14.73074324402292
4398. craft	unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance.	8.425897715117806
4399. the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession	from the american federation of labor of its industrial union	members.	7.028635093364642
4400. that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american	federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations.	9.906740415705523
4401. or that's what it looked like at the time.	6.285189734870328
4402. but automation	and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition	for jobs.	9.85616436997393
4403. walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction	of the afl-cio says another two years of this squabbling	will be disastrous for all american labor.	6.073322648003548
4404. whether it could	be as disastrous for american labor as say jimmy hoffa of the	teamsters is a matter of conjecture.	10.553131052064566
4405. but the jurisdictional disputes	that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for	labor.	7.401565881378932
4406. engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition	of national survival this country can have little patience with	labor's family feuds.	9.042660929679839
4407. the concept of labor as a special class is	outmoded and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free	world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself	to survive.	7.950724378537426
4408. the army navy and air	force among others may question secretary freeman's claim that	the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest	deterrent to the spread of communism.	8.169946346266451
4409. but the secretary insists that	the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source	of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.	8.66512387173143
4410. mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on	a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america's capacity	to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or	even by the soviet's successes in space.	6.970158450098624
4411. this shouldn't surprise	the secretary; american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses	for a long long time.	5.272639806121613
4412. in fact over the years the american	farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large	dollar.	9.266330979109217
4413. and thus far mr freeman has offered very little relief.	9.219196458378155
4414. the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored	has been declared a billion dollar fiasco.	9.736913592486335
4415. in exchange for higher price	supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage.	8.293540117657816
4416. but the	farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the	rows and pouring on the fertilizer.	9.446259238076008
4417. 1 billion	added to the deficit in the federal budget.	9.429415433399155
4418. perhaps as mr freeman	says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also	swindling the american taxpayer.	10.140870713971548
4419. a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington	has been going over the state department and has reached some	predictable conclusions.	8.019466593999695
4420. the department needs a clearer sense of	direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen	jackson says.	11.372075144157074
4421. the subcommittee is not alone in questioning	the effectiveness of the department.	9.633283391695263
4422. president kennedy has indicated	his dissatisfaction with its performance.	15.478252048692289
4423. but those who would	revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the	resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures	suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.	6.526827323201946
4424. nor does sen	jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in	the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the	study of foreign policy.	9.465437419580546
4425. this tends to create friction and confusion	and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and	initiative among his subordinates.	6.90657331167444
4426. but competent observers believe	he is making progress particularly toward what sen jackson	lists as the primary need- a clearer understanding of where our	vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them.	7.870188940402633
4427. the jackson report will provide some of the political support	mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel	engaged as sen jackson puts it in work that does not really	need doing.	8.346061533146267
4428. mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jackson's	recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national	security problems be improved.	7.591607701771603
4429. self-criticism is a rare but needed	commodity in congress.	5.221337998322256
4430. forecasting	economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.	9.89284969774127
4431. but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he	be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment	trends.	8.991273697751616
4432. james p mitchell when he was the head of the department	promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below	three million a couple of years ago.	10.325518792765472
4433. he lost but settled for a cake	in the shape of a fedora.	10.293261262673846
4434. his successor secretary goldberg	also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which	has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months.	9.211330064030282
4435. no	betting man mr goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out	again by predicting the rate will go down this month.	4.6033867543596845
4436. he is basing	his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened	its stride- a new record high in personal income an increase	in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for	durable goods.	8.297541416065748
4437. mr mitchell had an excuse for losing- the	steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated.	6.197167270340305
4438. mr goldberg	has less reason for missing.	13.39956997142236
4439. the economy seems to be sailing along on	an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an	end so they can't be blamed in november.	5.229708215483875
4440. the odds thus appear favorable	that the secretary's neck may be spared.	8.057209277186155
4441. cambodia's chief of state who has been accused of	harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for	neighboring south viet nam and thailand insists he would be very	unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia.	6.065912448225345
4442. but so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is prince	sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel.	10.043931763733958
4443. i have to see the	facts is the way the prince puts it.	14.327834651049942
4444. and from that point of vantage	he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western	posture.	11.288536433356722
4445. prince sihanouk's powers of prognostication	some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the	courage of his convictions.	5.8534700508337965
4446. commerce secretary hodges seems to have	been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington's economic	forecasters.	10.061674798292325
4447. weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second	quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking	their heads in disagreement.	6.872663081840603
4448. recently treasury secretary dillon and	labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges' appraisal	though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white	house.	8.595888372155512
4449. and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the	economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped	sliding and that it should start going upward from this point.	8.138742482812226
4450. he	is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.	13.8983907168008
4451. the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail	sales.	10.582247380384246
4452. february's volume was 1 per cent above january's for the	first pickup since last october although it's still 1.	5.2314930688170564
4453. 5 per cent	off from february 1960.	13.343838292726067
4454. corroborating mr hodges' figures	was the federal reserve board's report of the large sales increase	in the nation's department stores for the week ending march 4.	5.316487212034004
4455. in newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the	year-earlier level.	8.349666713488379
4456. of course some of the credit for the sale boost	must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter	comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.	15.005538059844188
4457. another optimistic	sign this one from the labor department was the report that	the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted	for the first time in the week ending feb 25.	8.931003086554247
4458. initial claims	for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8100 in the week	ending march 4.	9.294248208334002
4459. mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook	that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes.	6.40216646362696
4460. well we can't have everything.	7.126910479117037
4461. prosperity for the whole nation	is certainly preferred to a tax cut.	7.911696205205724
4462. new jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to	the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles	of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that	remain.	8.409427649727471
4463. now the stone harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction	for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends	far beyond our state.	6.649690186289996
4464. against the dramatic fight being waged	for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract	at stone harbor may seem unimportant.	8.308568581436145
4465. but interior secretary udall	warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few	surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment	of all as public preserves.	8.540638490994803
4466. the move for establishment	of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of cape cod from provincetown	to chatham is strengthened by president kennedy's interest	in that area.	6.679684478812063
4467. but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape	is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the	recreation spot of people from all over the country.	8.879736813948231
4468. by comparison	stone harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable	for aside from the audubon society they are mostly the snowy	common and cattle egrets and the louisiana green little blue and	black-crowned herons who nest and feed there.	6.123466269675248
4469. but there is hope for	conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the	kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its	park space.	8.62884058736119
4470. the desirability of preserving such places as the	cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every	year.	9.208954260962507
4471. public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is	growing.	7.072723287536689
4472. but that heritage is shrinking even faster.	15.549620985020194
4473. much of the glamor president kennedy's peace corps	may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent	shriver the head corpsman.	6.122281452878148
4474. anybody who is expecting a joyride	should according to mr shriver get off the train right now.	8.757229317473906
4475. first of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling.	11.611761661946934
4476. it will be a 16-hour training day.	18.747132032654008
4477. then off to a remote place in	an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living	conditions will be different.	7.170631819997336
4478. and the pay of course will be nil.	16.101972130962697
4479. despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination	of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by	the response than anybody else.	6.0401407124005795
4480. the study of the st louis area's economic prospects prepared	for the construction industry joint conference confirms and	reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey	of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois	countryside.	9.697754554419049
4481. st louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing	and in some places stagnant mid-continent region.	6.7179522016138185
4482. slackened	regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the region's	relative lack of purchasing power.	7.082735210013341
4483. not all st louis industries	of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.	7.928536312615819
4484. but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding	effect on the metropolitan core.	13.91162948690036
4485. the city has a stake in stimulating	growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern	illinois.	7.741115273054032
4486. gov dalton's new commerce and industry	commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective	effort to attract new industry.	7.222539229954505
4487. another	would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis president of	the university of missouri and provide for an impartial professional	analysis of missouri's economy.	5.965469733619895
4488. he says the state in order to	proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how	the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the	national economy.	10.827574191102356
4489. the research center of the university's	school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake	the analysis dr ellis has been talking about.	6.345153255063351
4490. he and dean	john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at	a recent conference.	10.377335712274375
4491. the university can make a valuable contribution	to the state's economic development through such a study.	5.9927378237650055
4492. in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically	depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth.	10.105959609672151
4493. the carbondale	industrial development corp has obtained a $500000 loan	to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate	production that will provide 500 new jobs.	4.91999136893761
4494. carbondale is in the	herrin-murphysboro-west	frankfort labor market where unemployment	has been substantially higher than the national average.	7.251684909624775
4495. the federal	program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri's depressed	areas and in the long run that will benefit st louis as	well.	6.98359101879095
4496. politics-ridden st clair county in illinois presents	another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.	10.16937013841688
4497. more industrial	acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other	jurisdiction in the st louis area.	7.410364787885353
4498. the unstable political situation	there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side.	11.606348242223339
4499. and then there is st louis county where the democratic	leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning	of the important relationship between proper land use and economic	growth.	7.946284762241559
4500. st louis county under its present leadership also has	largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted	parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests.	8.729343717800598
4501. some	plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st louis	county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more	jobs are lost.	4.602244898718985
4502. metropolitan st louis's relatively slow	rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business	civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi.	9.603706268038655
4503. without	a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy there will	not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st	louis will slip into second-class status.	5.136866061883618
4504. many of our very best friends are reformers.	15.463599639874655
4505. still we must confess	that sometimes some of them go too far.	8.501838298394917
4506. take for example the reformers	among new york city's democrats.	9.864518186975255
4507. having whipped mr de	sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall	they have changed the name to chatham hall.	6.357554771936201
4508. even though headquarters	actually have been moved into the chatham building do they believe	that they can make the new name stick?	10.581234186990514
4509.    granted that the tammany	name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political	shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to	their credit.	5.905510108166882
4510. but it is tradition rather than the record which balks	at the expunging of the tammany name.	13.71379216833299
4511. after all it goes back to the	days in which sedition was not un-american the days in which the sons	of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force	and violence- the british government that is.	5.975848558142587
4512. further do	our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent	to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo?	8.086459627402407
4513.  they will- when they	give up the donkey and the elephant.	6.303719368471719
4514. instead of attempting the impossible	why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's	stripes are not black?	9.837353627712687
4515.  that might go over.	13.325306093348317
4516. the	white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official	col mariano faget	from his preposterous position as interrogator	of cuban refugees for the immigration service.	7.956797524175535
4517. the	faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds.	6.857344612037563
4518. the kennedy	administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have	nothing to do with associates of dictator batista.	9.116283691985194
4519. using a batista	man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic	forces which alone can effectively oppose castro.	7.124874789265894
4520. moreover	col faget's information on cuba was too outdated to be	useful in screening castro agents; the colonel fled to the	friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized	power.	6.801281047535025
4521. and while he had headed batista's anti-communist	section	the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open	opponents who were alleged to be communists.	6.1557516653331
4522. responsibility	for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing an	eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service.	9.29205293390653
4523. gen swing	has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the	prerogatives of his office.	7.705595226219342
4524. his official term expired last summer.	10.473607739007651
4525. some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend	congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy	administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it	could get.	7.400677978585385
4526. congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration	matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.	8.200806640803911
4527. at that	point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen	swing.	9.605414856788112
4528. the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration	should not have to repeat.	11.864279229713386
4529. as	president dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from	the strife of partisan politics.	5.845145839736658
4530. as a former president however mr	eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during	a new york republican rally and generally missed his target.	9.259964172700835
4531. mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost	by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a	juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the	moon.	6.868468579101284
4532. nowhere did the speaker recognize	the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad.	9.416853365055129
4533. his	words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name	to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal	of international understanding.	7.101640353251411
4534. the former president blithely	ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under	kennedy administration fiscal policies.	9.425403583868714
4535. it was the eisenhower administration	which produced the largest peacetime deficit.	12.022558068848923
4536. finally	mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington.	9.55220028570865
4537. this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower	first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional	weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the	picture too.	6.731036065018782
4538. the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion	has hardly been compounded.	10.044014571957717
4539. ex-presidents relieved of accountability	for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability	for their words.	5.241568890136145
4540. some of former president truman's off-the-cuff	discourses have been in that vein.	10.81865589813378
4541. nobody can deny the right of former	chief executives to take part in politics but the american people	expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership	and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility.	8.565129352025403
4542. this is a matter	of respect for the presidency.	20.961472448303542
4543. mr eisenhower's new york speech	does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.	5.681139526977317
4544. the queen mary has long been a symbol of	speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high seas.	10.754673387296041
4545. reports	that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was	to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us.	7.021282881750924
4546. but the cunard	line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has	decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least.	10.163723121307019
4547. a new queen with the prosaic title of q3 had been planned	for several years to replace the queen mary.	7.186473527825667
4548. the british government	concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding	industry had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling	$50400000 toward the $84000000 cost of a new 75000-ton passenger	liner.	7.363302767095764
4549. since 1957 more and more trans-atlantic passengers	have been crossing by air.	6.447757394683386
4550. economy class fares and charter flights	have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines.	9.223945999688322
4551. competition	from other steamship lines has cut cunard's share of sea passengers	from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked	drop of profits on the atlantic run.	4.377345193327782
4552. the cunard line has	under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than	75000 tons.	10.196868521768156
4553. this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for	cruises during the lean winter months.	10.57950333836255
4554. also under consideration is	an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to	serve new york.	7.768257508231458
4555. the decline of the cunard line from its position	of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development	in the history of transportation.	7.844253559672725
4556. gen maxwell	taylor's statement in saigon that he is very much encouraged	about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam	turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement	that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to	bolster the vietnamese army.	7.223507225254392
4557. gen taylor will report to president	kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet	nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east	he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese	military economic political and other resources.	7.782397402944872
4558. there was	good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.	12.673430229401891
4559. communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their	activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a	new crisis.	6.381738863851948
4560. south viet nam's rice surplus for next year- more than	300000 tons- may have been destroyed.	6.166759388978324
4561. the viet cong the communist	rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.	6.593709695630945
4562. the	rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the	floods recede and the monsoon ends in november.	8.816246922808066
4563. nothing that	is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united	states soldiers for other than instructional missions.	6.544047072657711
4564. the indochina	struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when gen ridgway	estimated	it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win	a war the french were losing.	10.136917200044392
4565. it is a war to stay out of today especially	in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently	does not want united states troops.	11.766046024939858
4566. he may want additional technical	help and this should be forthcoming.	13.934441969734639
4567. south viet nam has received	$1450000000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance	has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnson's	visit last may.	6.158027741358388
4568. gen taylor the president's	special military adviser is a level-headed officer who is not likely	to succumb to propaganda or pressure.	6.671098998903708
4569. it is probable that his recommendations	will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to	involving the united states in an asian morass.	10.955364665961453
4570. gov john m dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long	service in government spoke with rich background and experience when	he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the	missouri general assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals	and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the	government and who are retained not because of their legal talents	but because of their government influence.	7.635206344914566
4571. ambassador stevenson yesterday	described the u n's problem of electing a temporary	successor to the late dag hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the	institution has faced.	5.750489422773227
4572. if the decision goes wrong	it may be- as mr stevenson fears- the first step on the	slippery path downhill to a u n without operational responsibilities	and without effective meaning.	6.946940011814153
4573. the integrity of the	office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as	the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization	but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions	from any government or any other authority external to	the organization.	5.952561313392533
4574. in other words the secretary general is to be	a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one.	13.121496033429562
4575. he should be as dag hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the	world.	9.264033616101639
4576. the charter does stipulate that due regard shall	be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical	basis as possible.	9.493294045187337
4577. the united states and its allies have	had no objection to this.	11.182897106869236
4578. what they have objected to is the attempt	of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold's	death to turn the entire u n staff from the secretary down	into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.	9.556112046204108
4579. the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic	origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly	around the nature of his relationship with them.	8.333045734899402
4580. although	the united states and the u s s r have been arguing	whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important	element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the	manner in which these deputies are to do their work.	11.827717031169522
4581. if any one	of them has any power to veto the secretary general's decisions	the nature of the organization will have changed.	7.719314826552824
4582. if they give him advice	when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction	the nature of the u n will not of necessity change.	12.457614994023894
4583. the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction	of the security council and the general assembly the power	to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled	by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.	6.764992281339849
4584. this is the root issue for which the united states should stand.	19.02041446131304
4585. we should not become confused or let our public become confused over	irrelevant questions of number or even of geography.	8.266479041366706
4586. what we must	have if the united nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan	an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject	to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's	ambition.	8.85138458775286
4587. the new city charter	which should get a yes vote as question no 1 on nov 7 would	not make a good mayor out of a bad one.	7.136250350952596
4588. there is no such magic	in man-made laws.	22.870111487393007
4589. but it would greatly strengthen any mayor's executive	powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of	inaction in the board of estimate increase his budget-making authority	both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right	to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.	6.5590704548436385
4590. lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate	and made	a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor.	13.127167726072628
4591. thus	there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative.	8.330669087925711
4592. the board is diminished in both respects while it retains control	over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment	of property and other trusteeship functions.	8.61269406160092
4593. the board will be able	to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the	mayor's veto; but the city council will now share fully this	budget-altering power.	5.927532281665722
4594. overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes	will require concurrence by board and council and a two-thirds vote.	7.060947373141585
4595. the controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions;	his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.	6.007762216388815
4596. he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties which go to the finance	department.	9.73290581820096
4597. on net balance in spite of controller gerosa's	opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the controller	will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government	than he has now.	6.9892531718336945
4598. borough presidents while retaining	membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions.	9.777041115289817
4599. highways go to a new department of highways sewers to the department	of public works such street cleaning as borough presidents	now do to the sanitation department.	6.2255435426218035
4600. some fiscal changes are important.	12.564727830972961
4601. the expense budget	is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy	in fund transfers within a department.	7.4834881991089315
4602. the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes	an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises;	but as a second-look safeguard each new project must undergo	a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.	6.9954404887367465
4603. a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore	dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on	progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city	instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected.	5.935947013841043
4604. this will	have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also	correct some injustices.	6.986964146600842
4605. enlargement of the city council	and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.	8.455996407235963
4606. the inter-american press association	which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape	horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in	eleven years.	10.822972572266924
4607. the i a p a is a reflection of the problems	and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably	means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution.	7.814825033452061
4608. as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime	more and more cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced	into exile.	8.993149759876454
4609. the i a p a found itself driven from journalism	into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall	of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the	freedom it knew before batista's dictatorship began in 1952.	6.9446440219730645
4610. freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption	and social imbalances.	12.927717983766179
4611. in such conditions all freedoms are lost.	10.852888400859145
4612. this in more diplomatic language is what adlai stevenson told the	newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states	government.	13.385468452837628
4613. he felt able to end on a note of hope.	10.469708618432746
4614. he sees evidence	of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with	its emphasis on social reforms.	8.789978110830655
4615. no group can contribute more to the	success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american	press association.	7.162275384424785
4616. the twenty-second	soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a	situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago	when this meeting was first announced.	7.513522248411857
4617. according to the original program	premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin	this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending	upon individual or national politics- because of the bold program	for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt.	5.660265064088533
4618. but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have	achieved utopia by 1980 the world is watching moscow today primarily	for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in	the immediate future.	10.214808955288946
4619. the evident contradiction between the rosy	picture of russia's progress painted by the communist party's	program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier	khrushchev's berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that	the program may be severely altered.	4.485928074530862
4620. whether it is or not the propaganda	impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted	at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated.	13.051251863067394
4621. and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on	and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised	for 1980 they and their children must first survive.	8.446325565797002
4622. this	congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and	laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness	remove him from the scene in the next few years.	8.78688043973325
4623. the widespread purge	that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist	leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who	will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect	will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening both	for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job.	6.725560717840726
4624. dr james b conant has	earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.	9.22449028369252
4625. his earlier reports considered the american public schools	basically sound and not in need of drastic change.	8.435592119923395
4626. now a close look	at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york	has shattered this optimism.	11.533120817049054
4627. dr conant has come away shocked	and angry.	9.583092523716516
4628. his new book entitled slums and suburbs calls for	fast and drastic action to avert disaster.	9.075195929868325
4629. there is room for	disagreement concerning some of dr conant's specific views.	9.820087880975038
4630. his	strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside	their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be	attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open	or permissive enrollment.	8.540027956258337
4631. dr conant may underestimate the psychological	importance of even token equality.	7.765908165531186
4632. his suggestion that	the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical	law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges	themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking	shape as a trend.	8.02812733392666
4633. but these are side issues to a powerful	central theme.	10.727951060967678
4634. that theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and	double-talk.	11.83444788906443
4635. it labels the slums especially the negro slums as dead-end	streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters.	8.055170573751573
4636. the villains	of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters	and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike.	9.181481434929653
4637. the facts	he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling	bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration	rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of	the color of their students.	5.953802404156446
4638. a call for action before it	is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who	in his	previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme	measures.	10.679329795876118
4639. these warnings must not be treated lightly.	9.368481542671873
4640. dr conant's	conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nation's	gratitude.	7.718009562813254
4641. he has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad;	but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward	report on the state of the public schools.	7.956034573802729
4642. a fascinating letter has just reached	this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.	7.317456353437718
4643. he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now	going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives	in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses	or even zone numbers.	7.783911083437974
4644. in accordance with legislation passed	at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to	deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters speeches and other	literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district.	10.757410514723073
4645. this means	an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining	of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal	deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk	mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.	5.74642614865642
4646. letter writing is a dying	art.	11.593094548182076
4647. occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and	many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly	typewritten.	7.300217998543513
4648. most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly	be called a letter.	10.238066418281342
4649. old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery.	8.45528453066333
4650. she had	she said heard that the plant was closing.	11.614056842144123
4651. it couldn't close she	said.	10.15468815686699
4652. she had raised a calf grown it beef-fat.	13.021353898944504
4653. she had with her own	work-weary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud	blossom and get ready to bear.	6.656027251093075
4654. she was ready to kill the beef dress	it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth	hash and stew against the winter.	10.415895635541563
4655. she had done it last year and	the year before and the year before that and she and her people	were dependent upon these cans for food.	7.6511240160811615
4656. this did not happen in	counties of north georgia where the rivers run and make rich the	bottom land.	10.498211874255457
4657. nor in south georgia where the summer sun shines warmly	and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.	7.2396877855097905
4658. this happened in decatur dekalb county not 10 miles from the	heart of metropolitian atlanta.	9.909177972545574
4659. and now the woman tired and	trembling came here to the dekalb county cannery.	9.224444821732463
4660. is it so the	cannery is going to close?	18.880905709861025
4661.    o n moss 61 tall	grey as a possum canning plant chief since 1946 didn't know what	to say.	5.506352630530718
4662. he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this	summer.	12.731861382157113
4663. he did say he was out of cans the no 3's but i requisitioned	22000.	9.855469090905826
4664. he said he had no 2's enough to last two	weeks more.	15.002910369499064
4665. threat of closing the cannery is a recent one.	9.581670957242892
4666. a	three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles	o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed.	7.810430809839503
4667. reason:	the cannery loses $3000 yearly.	4.521832590177764
4668. but dekalb citizens those	who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed	to make any money.	12.064299056108007
4669. the cannery said mrs lewellyn	lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during	the war and rationing years of 1941 to handle the victory garden	produce is a service to the taxpayer.	6.718245243574136
4670. and one of the best services	available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant	grow vegetables and put them up.	13.612590811557169
4671. it helps those people who help themselves.	12.270270630495158
4672. the county though seems more interested in those	people who don't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and	line up for surplus food.	7.056214016393818
4673. a driver of a dairy truck who	begins work at 1 am finishes before breakfast then goes out and	grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family	of five asked what in the world will we do?	6.684319512119482
4674.    what	in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes	the tomatoes will any of us do?	8.279753545777607
4675.    moss a man who knows	how much the cannery helps the county doesn't believe it will close.	5.8970414775067725
4676. but he is in the middle an employe of dekalb but on the side	of the people.	19.565855424214718
4677. the young married people; the old couples.	6.636738933951104
4678. the	dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew.	7.0323933822155755
4679. don't	ask me if i think the cannery helps he said.	7.8806654015584785
4680. sir i know	the cannery helps.	20.238943707907126
4681. most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.	13.669072244638578
4682. when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or	hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it.	10.84833760689364
4683. there	is one thing i know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner	peace as long as the heart holds a grudge.	7.463699875670866
4684. i know a man who held	resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades.	16.869205271013854
4685. several years	ago i was his pastor.	8.752420584702577
4686. one night at the close of the evening service	he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his	heart to god.	13.7825439381924
4687. after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story	of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on	his land.	7.596214047018524
4688. we tried to settle this dispute he said but	could never come to an agreement.	10.325456119696675
4689. i settled it tonight he continued.	10.407903923995505
4690. i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has	been lifted off my heart i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven	my neighbor.	10.738328587193605
4691. forgiveness is the door through which a	person must pass to enter the kingdom of god.	9.176600580422983
4692. you cannot wear the banner	of god and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in	your heart.	12.13439428960107
4693. henry van dyke said forgive and forget if you can;	but forgive anyway.	5.424705435049776
4694. jesus made three things clear about	forgiveness.	11.105768873108765
4695. we must first of all be willing to forgive others before	we can secure god's forgiveness.	8.361268769503354
4696. for if ye forgive men their	trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you: but if ye	forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive	your trespasses.	7.184315365169538
4697. it will do no good to seek	god's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.	9.20094840865742
4698. then jesus indicated that god's forgiveness is unlimited.	7.9377285494393774
4699. in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these	words forgive us our debts.	7.457620692838487
4700. when a person meets god's requirements	for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven.	10.303100911389441
4701. god's mercy	and patience will last forever.	4.870541301646994
4702. forgiveness implies more than a person	wanting his past sins covered by god's love.	7.9596846520284945
4703. it also implies	that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.	9.097190284643313
4704. we want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for	god to direct the future.	17.21444784617173
4705. finally we must be willing to forgive	others as many times as they sin against us.	10.057863114436133
4706. once peter asked	how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him?	9.367691385585887
4707.  till	seven times?	9.723875566280467
4708.  jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven.	10.46896101270908
4709. jesus not only taught forgiveness he	gave us an example of it on the cross.	8.574360324922829
4710. with all the energy of his broken	body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what	they do.	10.978495002882461
4711. she's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although	she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby she is getting	married.	5.133749372229218
4712. her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to	tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish	to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish	said.	8.55329147929258
4713. for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn't	have made myself heard if i'd had the equivalent of the message	to garcia.	6.151249718885808
4714. but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been	through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young	female- six girls sprawled on one bed drinking cokes and giggling-	she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.	8.923445515659765
4715. how	do you know you love somebody enough to get married?	8.057090453234775
4716.  she asked.	20.438894541484256
4717. it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have	ever asked: how can you be sure?	8.452863316476439
4718.    aren't you sure?	7.151855088421901
4719. 	i asked looking at her searchingly.	7.2267423576167955
4720. i wanted to grab her by the	arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life	is so long and marriage is so important.	9.157144225236799
4721. but if she were just having	a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten	her out of a really good marriage.	7.28174031670361
4722. besides in all honesty i don't	know how you can be sure.	7.502365078336536
4723. i don't know any secret recipe for certainty.	3.8022314886500848
4724. in the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love	the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships	are sometimes obscured.	8.588091644455979
4725. i knew of but one test and i threw it	out to her for what it was worth.	8.274700438696371
4726. does he ever bore you?	17.371554283161903
4727. 	i asked.	9.723875566280467
4728. bore me?	13.35962875745771
4729.  she was shocked.	15.546490238477817
4730. oh no-o! why	he's so darling and h   i mean i went on ruthlessly	when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders	of love is he interesting?	6.275199499125716
4731.  does he care about things that matter	to you?	11.13618807890406
4732.  can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island	for years and years and still find him fascinating?	10.209874167288357
4733.    because	honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in	every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded together.	4.187561540207232
4734. and if you bore each other then heaven help you.	14.766441638831406
4735. she came	back the other day to reassure me.	8.938075136047432
4736. she has studied and observed and	she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.	13.710250033975427
4737. she asked if i had other advice and heady with success	i rushed it in i hope not too late.	7.97224368091488
4738. be friends with your mother-in-law.	16.303978835090597
4739. jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothers-in-law make	good friends.	5.6988710799035704
4740. i do not know dr wilson sneed well.	19.051005372645047
4741. but i was deeply moved	by his letter of resignation as rector of st luke's church	in atlanta.	7.240578051172566
4742. it was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many	in the clergy i suspect.	10.698780513265454
4743. the pulpit is a lonely place.	10.148288634150871
4744. who stops	to think of that?	13.731517450242983
4745.    imagine the searching and the prayer that	lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service	to this majestic church.	6.580112303117152
4746. such a church needs vigor and vitality	in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments	he told his members.	10.350169102048106
4747. a minister should not stay beyond the	time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote h	for he becomes ordinary h.	6.4994135559504
4748. and so the young minister	resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he	told his parishioners when i did not gain from you far more than	i ever gave to you.	9.37387199037052
4749. his very honest act called up the recent	talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said:	i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love	and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way: and	it is unworthy to think of self.	6.0733228013217175
4750. but oh how i do sometimes need just	a moment of rest and peace in myself.	11.44140913433697
4751. a man who gives	himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself	a life of giving.	8.261155555738418
4752. he does not expect to get great riches or he would	not have chosen to answer the call to preach.	13.397960960664708
4753. the good ones are not	motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they	would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.	6.553646238842705
4754. theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.	10.801930528261328
4755. yet we who	lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation	of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice	as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is	in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul.	7.195385565078363
4756. we press	him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions	with his word and god's.	9.425811835124286
4757. we do not defeat the good ones	with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them	to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance	and a few bucks a week american cash.	6.914434599878531
4758. if we break the minister	to our bit we are buying back our own sins.	11.005135238504197
4759. if he won't break we	add to the stress he bears.	7.15325935320681
4760. and a minister of all men is most	conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly	humanity is heir to.	9.081204925879165
4761. we expect him to be noble and to make us so-	yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be.	8.136030048198242
4762. we expect bestowal of god's love through him.	8.870230356574444
4763. but how little love	we give him.	11.732497093449684
4764. the church truly is not a rest home for saints but a	hospital for sinners.	11.423473396683038
4765. yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency	room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who	ministered to us is a human being who suffers too.	6.9323670886425575
4766. mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each	summer at loon lake.	9.827807939517722
4767. the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around	it only emphasized the pleasure.	6.908521846585377
4768. the evening was not always	spent in the same way.	13.712841031390766
4769. this year on a night cool with the front of september	moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers	were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod.	8.202217807864242
4770. the little cottage	was bursting with people of all ages.	13.064164416011545
4771. in the midst of it all	mr podger came out on the pod porch alone.	12.015624567252823
4772. he had that day	attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize.	14.989122662140606
4773. the prize was an old-fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross-top	pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging.	4.773741202277203
4774. mrs podger	had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for	it and there it was slung in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze	rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement.	7.63460495161432
4775. mr	podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two	slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it.	6.6104822289566565
4776. he closed	his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly	over him.	10.132777878229303
4777. suddenly one young voice rose above the others.	9.205844614018098
4778. but	it said do you always know when you're happy?	8.190268723555954
4779. 	the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question	stayed in mr podger's mind.	6.1140687503238045
4780. here in the cool autumn-touched	evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly	contented and at peace.	10.26298584312774
4781. it had begun with the blue jay	feather.	15.820405049795443
4782. walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had	seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight.	8.741479762313224
4783. the winging	spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood.	8.012220815731464
4784. the	small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet.	10.4877904483447
4785. all	day long mr podger who was a straw-hat man in the summer had	worn	the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.	5.539159124899316
4786. would a blue	feather in a man's hat make him happy all day?	6.973126203218104
4787.  hardly.	12.348350321510317
4788. but it	was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning	sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by	the lake.	12.088764963247472
4789. then since the auction was being held nearby he had	walked to it.	7.486135976779023
4790. and there on the way had been the box turtle that	slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bent for	reasons best known to itself on crossing the road.	8.390056420453114
4791. it was doing very	well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable	singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching	in the shape of a flashy little sports car.	7.215364986335205
4792. would the driver see	the turtle?	14.073427641123088
4793.  would he take pains to avoid it?	9.412327193690137
4794.    mr podger	took no chances.	13.123662463156814
4795. taking off his hat and signaling the driver with	it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle	and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking	suddenness.	5.907030882851175
4796. the turtle immediately withdrew into its private	council room to study the phenomenon.	10.895944810307936
4797. but mr podger and the	driver of the sports car waved at each other.	8.81683885258569
4798. here in the cool darkness	mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still	see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the	friendly grin on the young sun-browned face as the driver looked back	over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.	8.558264031512216
4799. where was the driver now?	11.946383260863952
4800.  what was he doing?	19.758983445063322
4801.  and the turtle?	16.467048908926223
4802. 	mr podger smiled.	10.982563828180641
4803. for a few brief minutes they had all been	part of one little drama.	9.532264536353578
4804. the three would never meet again but for	some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember	the incident.	9.268868580201119
4805. then there had been the auction itself.	15.198634148556636
4806. mr	podger heard again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices	of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested	in mr podger's hammock purchase.	8.202628427105031
4807. i like them things	too he had said.	12.316991287344878
4808. we got one at home.	17.696582287590008
4809. you know what?	19.958555847557943
4810.  if	you're lyin' out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool-	you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-	and wrap 'em right over you.	5.416181058060385
4811. i do it lots o' times- i like to	lie in a hammock at night by myself when it's all quiet.	5.730602838262215
4812. h the	wind moves it a little bit- you know h.	8.174044463339756
4813. mr podger	had	thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice.	9.218304817928797
4814. as he pulled	the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon mr podger	saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that	the boy too was lying in a cool fringed-wrapped quiet.	8.026801567596896
4815. alacrity	the podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly	against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up.	6.153208279011061
4816. she remarked that	she found the night wind a little chilly and mr podger took her	inside the fringe.	8.862205278603426
4817. soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree	crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod.	6.151715799812824
4818. mr	podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen	door opened and pam burst out.	10.790861762867081
4819. it's	getting so chilly we've lighted a fire and we're going to tell	a round robin story- a nice scary one.	2.8515640659525174
4820. we need you to start it.	18.081189722968386
4821. why	are you out here all by yourself?	7.605336819168685
4822.  aren't you happy?	7.151855088421901
4823. 	mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking alacrity under	his arm to bring her in by the fire.	5.754553600569626
4824. of course i am he said.	21.21608965536432
4825. never happier in my life.	8.58820442963414
4826. i just came out here to know it.	15.848905163317637
4827. as the south begins another school year national and even	world	attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial	equality in the public schools.	6.46686677268706
4828. desegregation is beginning in	two more important southern cities- dallas and atlanta.	7.433939006382426
4829. in each	city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public	opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.	8.360984382112658
4830. these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.	12.711951873775874
4831. the programs do not take sides on the issue itself.	9.532667513275456
4832. they point	out simply that it is the law of the land.	21.12752804928246
4833. the two	cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up	as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes	of desegregation.	7.369695677773355
4834. even better they have the examples of nashville	and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.	11.355848590160317
4835. in each case there was an initial act of violence.	12.693762763863443
4836. in nashville a	school was dynamited.	14.586206078474078
4837. in houston there were a few incidents of friction	between whites and negroes none of which were serious.	8.452636986079925
4838. in	each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government	halted the threats of more serious incidents.	8.621976435884477
4839. the nashville	plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable	and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south.	7.6998333146748275
4840. it is a stair-step plan in which desegregation begins in	the first grade.	12.781983988966742
4841. each year another grade is added to the process until	finally all 12 grades are integrated.	8.946050751215095
4842. the schedules are flexible	so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant	or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why	not now.	10.770338880775537
4843. the program has worked well in both nashville and	houston.	11.251191873529981
4844. it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools	selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by	white parents.	10.490752002487742
4845. another attempt will be made this year in new orleans	to resume the program.	7.814318045530022
4846. generally throughout the south	there is a	growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every	step of desegregation is met.	9.34254739215188
4847. perhaps the most eloquent move	toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas.	10.084650362396614
4848. during the summer	negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants	and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.	9.343503905083336
4849. it was part	of a citywide move toward full integration.	11.101352776201146
4850. so successful has	been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that	further extensions are expected in the next few months.	9.857731518921042
4851. hotels for	example are ready to let down the bars.	8.47480450045142
4852. already at least one hotel	has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis.	9.6368181739073
4853. several conventions	have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated	basis.	8.063817755827019
4854. this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions	which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed	against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods	of dallas.	9.810826583773537
4855. it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude	which appears to be spreading all across the south.	12.16487330046878
4856. southern	whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence	to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights.	9.590390880749295
4857. they insist	they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama	when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination	in local bus depots.	7.094545445277849
4858. all across the south there are signs	that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves	would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant	attitude toward it.	8.706123072345472
4859. there are many causes for this change.	18.67465418990101
4860. one	of the most important is economic.	17.164708158707423
4861. business leaders are aware now	that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.	6.451409187622921
4862. they are putting	strong pressure on their police departments to keep order.	11.443171500401384
4863. in the	past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way.	10.089025883492024
4864. and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of	co-operation	has sprung up.	12.226171953131628
4865. this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites	to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation.	5.441714924107902
4866. they	realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will	not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and	otherwise.	7.5715028779082205
4867. since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a	few months ago i've been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship.	6.298226003667701
4868. played mostly on the freeways around los angeles it goes like	this:   a driver cruising easily at 70 mph in lane	a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead.	6.373837479444144
4869. traffic	in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes	a tentative fender into lane b which is heavily populated by cars	also moving at 70 mph.	5.650914410679676
4870. the adjacent driver in lane	b has three choices open to him.	10.47662429430968
4871. he can point his car resolutely	at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane	a; slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;	or alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the	first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating	sport of the whole affair.	5.406953325232029
4872. the really remarkable thing to	me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down	and permit the invading car free access.	8.399983413138338
4873. whether or not this is done	out of enlightened self-preservation i don't know.	4.714614319864075
4874. but it is done	consistently and i'm both surprised and impressed.	11.300107290208741
4875. this	could never happen in my native chicago.	6.834306583952283
4876. there such soggy acquiesence	would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood.	11.39795594222066
4877. in	chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor	in an effort to force the other car back.	6.608238302473966
4878. failing this he would pull	alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.	11.125450791379112
4879. this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however	does an injustice to southern california drivers.	7.267169404551664
4880. at the risk	of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company i would	like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype.	8.78984869208913
4881. after three months	of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are	considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i've	ever encountered.	6.0372381725168305
4882. during one recent day of driving about los	angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers	stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible	side street.	10.147328466569697
4883. an out-of-town writer came up to paul	richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball	club would be improved this year.	5.886694932387903
4884. now richards of course is	known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go.	9.31254518942705
4885. he can often make the	complex ridiculously simple and vice versa.	9.457956209719452
4886. this happened to be	vice versa but even so the answer	was a masterpiece.	11.845405396236817
4887. it's a whole lot easier he said	to increase the population of nevada than it is to increase the	population of new york city.	5.037605894326358
4888. and with that he walked off to give	instruction to a rookie pitcher.	13.710208832515033
4889. that is undoubtedly a hell	of a quote said the writer scratching his head.	8.189559859053752
4890. now if i	can just figure out what he's talking about i'll use it.	6.388871910687763
4891. spots open	this was just richard's way of saying that last	year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.	5.694668717162402
4892. some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two	spots left and right field are really up for grabs.	10.597381472346445
4893. it should	be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots	that were open last year but so far it hasn't worked that way.	7.893189563514085
4894. this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this	year is an interesting one.	11.682641309309274
4895. you'd never guess it from the way they've	played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some	around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the	pennant in 1961.	6.419350277549198
4896. obviously if this club is going to move from	second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement	someplace.	14.427850370631184
4897. where can that improvement possibly come from?	9.27269448675615
4898. 	you certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than	it did last year.	7.26182944175603
4899. brooks robinson is great	and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he	did in 1960.	6.313336632163484
4900. you can't expect it though.	6.421403380096084
4901. robby's performance last	year was tremendous.	5.404238879450178
4902. it's the same with ron hansen and	jim gentile.	3.3287262196189356
4903. if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no	complaint.	16.78479893345924
4904. they shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.	10.102145371320562
4905. hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might	very well set him back.	7.326226855566177
4906. he got off to an exceptional start last season	and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.	9.075380373774694
4907. there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching	to him last year.	9.499478018953015
4908. they don't expect to stop him just slow him	down some with the bat.	6.9684634980211495
4909. he'll still be a top player they concede	because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him.	4.090272279623988
4910. but	they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.	7.601146835666093
4911. might move up	gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.	6.771567939360761
4912. i have a hunch marv breeding might move	up a notch.	12.760350481900415
4913. but even so he had a good year in 1960 and won't do	too much better.	8.245873416927143
4914. so all in all the infield can't be expected	to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second	to first.	8.45887521669605
4915. and the pitching will also have trouble doing better.	9.565698880364566
4916. richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and	experience last season.	9.731420548131133
4917. where then can we look for improvement?	10.73401104749689
4918. 	from triandos brandt and walker answers richards.	8.431184275504776
4919. they're the ones we can expect to do better.	4.261160444783584
4920. the	man is right and at this time indications are that these three are	ready for better seasons.	11.006693653671979
4921. triandos hasn't proved it yet but	he says he's convinced his thumb is all right.	3.6330655576839526
4922. he jammed it this	spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasn't bothered	him.	10.716514332090506
4923. if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years	the club will have to be better off offensively.	14.528736550747523
4924. i'm still	not convinced though i'll have to see more of him before predicting	that big year for him.	5.423565352437366
4925. hank foiles backed up by frank house	who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second	line catching than the birds had all last year but gus is still	that big man you need when you start talking pennant.	6.0663410835898235
4926. to me	brandt	looks as though he could be in for a fine year.	14.950974626407266
4927. he hasn't played	too much because richards has been working on him furiously in batting	practice.	6.778236772990386
4928. he's hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and	his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.	5.468134717392438
4929. when	he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win	the national league pennant and he was joining what seemed to be	a second division american league club.	7.061243095214209
4930. he was down hard to talk	to	and far too nonchalant on the field.	12.495425379826631
4931. as of now that all seems behind	him.	13.007860713159404
4932. he's been entirely different all spring.	4.019025702904546
4933. and walker	looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year.	9.54930892603214
4934. let	him bounce back and he could really set up the staff.	10.776541615885426
4935. so	if the orioles are to improve brandt triandos and walker will have	to do it.	6.734618778346564
4936. so far the platoons on left and right fielders don't	seem capable of carrying the load.	10.751242587087594
4937. of course this isn't	taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york	city but it's the way things look from here at this point.	5.351953148940591
4938. is the mother of an autistic child at fault?	17.040926125507756
4939. 	child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.	6.9822078750006185
4940. he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects-	did his	mother make him this way?	11.173003466706202
4941.    some people believe she did.	11.442591512887825
4942. we believe that autism like so many other conditions	of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn.	12.20251585815979
4943. a mother	can help a child adapt to his difficulties.	7.604351809897675
4944. sometimes she	can- to a large extent- help him overcome them.	6.621337802043415
4945. but we don't think	she creates them.	5.712867634031937
4946. we don't think she can make her child defective	emotionally disturbed or autistic.	6.640141781041601
4947. the mother of a difficult	child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing	her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem.	7.822029555041362
4948. since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written	for the layman we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.	7.368504724657294
4949. she wrote:	as the mother of an autistic	child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything	i have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he	first	plays with a new toy.	5.849577102394824
4950. he wants me to do everything for him.	15.959418227844859
4951. you	don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of	something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats	them.	6.798817415272679
4952. but i do and my psychiatrist does too.	18.433080035189203
4953. i know that my	son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give	full control or direction.	7.771257583076079
4954. one thing i notice which i	have seldom heard mentioned.	14.408624186147536
4955. this is that autistic people don't enjoy	physical contact with others- for instance my children and i.	5.521052147454348
4956. when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is	as straight and stiff as a board.	9.295235205043864
4957. he pushes and straightens himself	as if he can't stand the feeling of being held.	5.541231982054119
4958. physical contact is	uncomforatble for him!   this mother is quite correct.	7.132222477465294
4959. as	a rule the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others.	4.931003212429807
4960. parents have to find other ways of comforting him.	11.71942399107225
4961. for the young	child this may be no more than providing food light or movement.	10.287425049508402
4962. as	he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object	.	11.285116445591736
4963. or certain words or rituals that child and	adult go through may do the trick.	6.903082439213426
4964. the answer is different for each autistic	child but for most there is an answer.	13.305832284129838
4965. only ingenuity will uncover	it.	10.418581169757244
4966. dear doctors: we learned this	year that our older son daniel is autistic.	6.655992629190234
4967. we did not accept the	diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to.	9.504587225855154
4968. fortunately there	is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group	of normal children.	11.807437656033686
4969. i try to treat daniel as if he were normal	though of course i realize he is far from that at present.	10.585666989791536
4970. what	i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible.	15.34653862144787
4971. i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.	10.276761667541988
4972. what is your experience with autistic children?	15.215108009476548
4973.  how do they	turn out later?	12.208424230918823
4974.    many autistic children grow up to lead	relatively normal lives.	12.339153950360261
4975. certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth	in communication with other people but many adjust to school even	college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood.	6.925136662583084
4976. use	- a first grader colors pictures one solid color	everything- sky grass boy wagon etc.	5.397285871302539
4977. when different colors	are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green	etc.	8.686619094910906
4978. the other children in the class use this same coloring	book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color.	11.436598052249641
4979. should	i show my daughter how things should be colored?	6.609758834123004
4980.  she is an aggressive	nervous child.	16.62074161289298
4981. is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help	her outgrow these traits?	8.13375112224593
4982.  - her choice of one color	means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having	reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.	6.3354671426427736
4983. this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature	for the first grade.	8.831970354523193
4984. no coloring isn't exactly something	you teach a child.	6.880332521121025
4985. you sometimes give them a little demonstration	a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines.	7.869005724439736
4986. but	most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only	a very little demonstration.	11.073418447334758
4987. seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest	in an old art: embroidery.	5.89215627571122
4988. possibly responsible for this is the incoming	trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to	replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed.	9.401804634828961
4989. just as	a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme	so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.	7.441641184147046
4990. one such	in fact is a rug.	14.350256094116457
4991. though not actually crewel embroidery it has	that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze	and gold and a sauterne background.	5.344546784280941
4992. the twirled stylized design of	winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns	used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in	england.	7.315010836978244
4993. traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing	more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available	in this country.	9.470974871050611
4994. the work is executed in england and	can be worked in any desired design and color.	11.30226123681803
4995. among some recent	imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on	which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens	and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.	5.677591073348449
4996. for a particularly fabulous room which houses	a collection of fine english chippendale furniture fabric wall panels	were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this	revered eighteenth century period.	7.166970670311868
4997. since the work is done by hand	the only limitation it is said is that of human conception.	12.121704504791316
4998. modern embroidered panels framed and meant to be hung on the	wall are another aspect of this trend.	9.504193244228432
4999. these have never gone out of	style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and	there in shops which specialize in handicrafts.	6.647953844664227
5000. an amateur decorator	might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by	picking up her living room color scheme add a decorative do-it-yourself	note to the room.	7.280759808637628
5001. california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962	model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling	in a thousand district headquarters party clubrooms and workers'	backyards.	5.59262517060589
5002. they seem darned proud of it.	13.810232655705748
5003. and they're	confident that the gop currently assailed by dissensions	within the ranks will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood	of this grassroots-fueled machine.	5.443799596804196
5004. their meeting at san	francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california	democratic council directorate.	9.49691106505268
5005. but it will include 200-odd officeholders	organization leaders and interested party people.	9.607948442320323
5006. out of this session may come: - plans for a dramatic	broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist	top-drawer democrats from all over the country.	8.019628107454105
5007. blueprints	for doubling the cdc's present 55000 enrollment.	5.092823687184924
5008. arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in	fresno next jan 26-28.	7.161363122069615
5009. and proposals for a whole series	of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new congressional	districts.	4.705622848877124
5010. at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox	39-year-old amateur politico thomas b carvey jr	whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft's moon	missiles.	9.000184114778632
5011. he's approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering	fashion.	2.98127158239478
5012. viewed from afar the cdc looks like	a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out	into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence	into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so.	5.67425178046792
5013. much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every	volunteer democratic organization of any consequence belongs to	the cdc.	9.114458084194556
5014. moreover the entire state democratic hierarchy	from gov brown on down to the county chairmen also participates	in this huge operation.	9.813306467225061
5015. contrarily republican volunteers	go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication	that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate	except in the most loose-knit fashion.	5.545632013275464
5016. carvey believes that	reapportionment	which left many democratic clubs split by these new district	boundaries actually will increase cdc membership.	7.719262966938341
5017. where	only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth.	6.612185353458039
5018. biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up cdc	units in rock-ribbed democratic territory.	6.9167043042349015
5019. paradoxically the council	is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's	favor strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly	even basis.	4.242611205028398
5020. like most democratic spokesmen carvey predicts	1962 will be a tremendously partisan year.	9.307398008023744
5021. hence the attention	they're lavishing on the cdc.	7.227427870748537
5022. in all probability the	council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for	congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary	favorites.	9.445919069191739
5023. this bodes heated contests in several districts where	claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don't	see eye-to-eye with the cdc.	4.996753860477549
5024. naturally the statewide	races will provide the major test for the expanding council.	10.621476269382955
5025. shunted	aside by the rampant organizers for john f kennedy last	year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential	campaign the cdc plainly intends to provide the party's	campaign muscle in 1962.	6.024672416019111
5026. there is evidence that it will be happily received	by gov brown and the other constitutional incumbents.	17.68910333295579
5027. carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown's	most formidable foe with ex-gov knight a close second.	4.736910824767019
5028. but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don't worry	him very much.	10.119239332684376
5029. in his cdc work carvey has the close-in	support and advice of one of california's shrewdest political strategists:	former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren	who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty gen	stanley mosk.	4.791848421028472
5030. that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren	note: we've	just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment	organizing convention wednesday night in south	pasadena's war memorial bldg which graphically illustrates the	cdc's broad appeal.	5.8140932105216425
5031. state sen dick richards will keynote;	state and county	committeemen cdc directors and representatives	members of 16 area clubs and all residents have been invited.	5.397794615531737
5032. this is going to be a language lesson and you can master it in	a few minutes.	16.23443322931772
5033. it is a short course in communese.	17.944614947581417
5034. it works	with english russian german hungarian or almost any other foreign	tongue.	11.04127592738999
5035. once you learn how to translate communese much of each	day's deluge of news will become clearer.	6.721957284518306
5036. at least i have found it	so.	23.465004356988718
5037. for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated	dr freud communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably	impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves.	6.718307079026764
5038. they	accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves	are most guilty.	9.276078601513452
5039. president kennedy's latest warning to the	communist world that the united states will build up its military	strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly	reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the	iron curtain.	5.533730238800752
5040. then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces	with striking consistency.	10.912769519132212
5041. now listen closely:	moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england:	president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals	to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat as part of	the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism.	5.611805309189715
5042. evidently	the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred	up in the west have been planned long in advance.	8.089819598304759
5043. the west berlin	crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the	united states to justify its arms drive.	9.07222099186644
5044. the soviet news	agency tass datelined from new york in english to europe:	president kennedy's enlargement of the american military	program was welcomed on wall street as a stimulus to the american	munitions industry.	8.905607330400953
5045. when the stock exchange opened this morning	many dealers were quick to purchase shares in douglas lockheed and	united aircraft and prices rose substantially.	6.633546203339509
5046. over 4 million shares	were sold the highest figures since early june.	9.442325581577846
5047. tass datelined los angeles in english to europe:	former vice president nixon came out in support of	president kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race.	5.20212934744589
5048. he also	demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international	tension: specifically to crush the cuban revolution resume	nuclear testing resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful	seat in the united nations and postpone non-military programs at	home.	8.204610376908896
5049. tass from moscow in english to europe:	the american press clamored for many days promising president	kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems	confronting the united states.	6.057375183721095
5050. in fact the world heard nothing	but sabre-rattling the same exercises which proved futile for the	predecessors of the current president.	9.348144915659022
5051. if there were no west berlin	problem imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping	up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems	besetting the united states and its nato partners.	9.382649983213012
5052. washington	apparently decided to use an old formula by injecting large	military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the us economy	after a prolonged slump.	8.765473230717916
5053. and now for communist	listeners and readers:   moscow radio in russian to the ussr:	the us president has shown once again that	the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis	to justify the armaments race.	5.731724254060173
5054. as was to be expected kennedy's latest	speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn	where officials of the west german government praised it.	8.614342864305655
5055. moscow novosti article in russian datelined london:	us pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status	of west berlin has reached its apogee.	5.304056324387977
5056. british common sense is	proverbial.	15.428551927769684
5057. the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate	ordinary britons shows that this british common sense is unwilling to	pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures.	6.115358476439102
5058. east berlin radio in german to germany:	a better position for negotiations is the real point	of this speech.	7.825904347708282
5059. kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west	berlin neither conventional nor nuclear and negotiations will come	as certainly as the peace treaty.	5.928238285988349
5060. whenever some washington circles	were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always	succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn.	8.841366233442177
5061. in kennedy's speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless	ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president's	advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.	5.2271011066171535
5062. well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war	over west berlin.	11.044893938141334
5063. moscow tass in russian datelined	sochi:   chairman khrushchev received the us president's	disarmament adviser john mccloy.	4.461368144957598
5064. their conversation	and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere.	9.678416091269662
5065. now	to translate from the communese this means:   the west berlin	crisis is really an east berlin crisis.	5.866981848681561
5066. the crisis	was artificially stirred up by the kremlin and the	red army.	11.128853737029443
5067. the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr	which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power and try to end	the permanent recession in russian living standards.	6.574911672579342
5068. chairman	khrushchev in order to cure	his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position.	9.486070564902905
5069. his advisers	in the politburo are engaged in a great struggle	of opinions so he is not always consistent.	7.756606006448818
5070. the soviet union	will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over berlin	and neither will its warsaw pact allies.	10.26040644250651
5071. the west has no intention	of attacking russia.	9.455448659544777
5072. chairman khrushchev and john mccloy	had a terrible row at sochi.	9.899893878542356
5073. see communese is easy- once	you get onto it.	5.99194187527271
5074. aug 4 1821 nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded	the pennsylvania gazette- a century during which it had undergone	several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication-	this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening	post.	7.020261585644534
5075. the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c atkinson	and charles alexander who had just taken over franklin's	old paper desired a more distinctive name.	5.567033229419897
5076. when founded by franklin	the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name	its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually	contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays.	8.270403504064907
5077. in the	middle of the century with a circulation of 90000 the post was one	of the most popular weeklies in the country.	9.294845858290886
5078. but during the second half	of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus	h k curtis purchased it- paper type and all-	for $1000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and	initialed miscellany and with only some 2000 subscribers.	6.557193400908474
5079. little	more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the	franklin tradition the saturday evening post was slow to revive.	6.599047446994226
5080. but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became	one of the most popular weeklies of the country.	9.532008091959012
5081. remember the french railroad baron who was going to take me	floating down the nile?	9.528001881478685
5082.  h remember the night will rogers	filled a tooth for me between numbers?	9.981436299347745
5083.  h sure we met a	barrel of rich men but it's hard to find the real thing when you're	young beautiful and the toast of two continents h remember	fanny brice promised my mother she would look after me on the road?	5.5891222699995895
5084. 	all this remembering took place the other night when i	had supper with the ziegfeld girls at the beverly hills club.	9.919905167291134
5085. a quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy of walking dreams	sashayed up and down the staircases of the old new amsterdam theater	ny.	7.922777157188649
5086. but watching mrs cyril ring berniece dalton	janssen mrs robert jarvis mrs walter adams order low-calory	seafood no bread i could see the ziegfeld girls of 1920	were determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.	7.367670728837563
5087. i was	anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the great white way.	8.773937988693604
5088. all	i could remember was billie dove pasted over the ceiling of my	big brother's room.	7.183160255597471
5089. billie was really beautiful! exclaimed	vera forbes adams batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed	glasses.	4.494459769220565
5090. sing sing's prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable	purpose a fair break from parole boards.	6.569019827427897
5091. but once the strike trend	hits hoosegows there is no telling how far it may go.	9.917991180925256
5092. inmates might	even demand the 34-hour week all holidays off and fringe benefits including	state contributions toward lawyers' fees.	6.061099269508706
5093. some day we might	see a federation of prison and jail inmates with a leader busily	trying to organize reformatory occupants defendants out on bail convicts	opposed to probation officers etc.	5.8613639157879405
5094. a three-day confinement	week with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around	could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation with	fringe benefits including:  wider space between iron bars	and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of	metal.	6.358341624305357
5095. an agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks	used on prison doors.	7.1495436412313635

5132. the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being	celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament	the first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new	translation of the scriptures into contemporary english.	10.762943016170173
5133. since	it was issued in the spring of 1611 the king james version has	been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations	of the bible.	7.093116399833909
5134. however biblical scholars frequently attested	to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered	and scholarship advanced.	7.928778276736408
5135. this resulted in revisions of the king	james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in	1901 as the american standard version.	6.2687350267137205
5136. then in 1937 america's	international council of religious education authorized a new revision	in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.	8.532644868488344
5137. undertaken by 32 american scholars under the chairmanship	of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university	divinity school their studies resulted in the publishing of the	revised standard version 1946-52.	5.4390111536534445
5138. the new english	bible	has not been planned to rival or replace the king james	version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible	to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship.	9.797369911546594
5139. time of course will testify whether the new version will have	achieved its purpose.	8.783321885085414
5140. bible reading even more so than good classical	music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.	8.776115740035118
5141. if this	new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout	the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james	version.	8.09822474250854
5142. however an initial perusal and comparison of some	of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to	speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars.	10.21420141501282
5143. one is	impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation	into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of	the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary	language than in the frequently	archaic words and phrases of the	king james.	8.783042472351465
5144. for example in the third chapter of matthew verses	13-16 describing the baptism of jesus the 1611 version reads:	then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john	to be baptized of him.	7.59272033305572
5145. but john forbad him saying i have	need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me?	8.262109129185301
5146.    and	jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now: for thus it	becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.	7.335998268543823
5147. and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the	water: and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit	of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him.	6.190800789509304
5148. meaning	certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not	familiar with biblical teachings in the new english bible which reads:	then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee and he came	to john to be baptized by him.	8.458234196053002
5149. john tried to dissuade him.	9.305176652275113
5150. 'do you	come to me'?	7.4053514116096535
5151.  he said; 'i need rather to be baptized by you'.	7.502333121650326
5152. jesus replied 'let it be so for the present; we do well to	conform this way with all that god requires'.	8.005015220841322
5153. john then allowed him	to come.	8.45769710002979
5154. after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once and	at that moment heaven opened; he saw the spirit of god descending	like a dove to alight upon him;	among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes	and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the	true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning	of the sermon on the mount.	7.312367294373842
5155. to illustrate the first blessing	in the king james bible reads: blessed are the poor in	spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven.	5.7816784144737605
5156. the new version	states: how blest are those who know that they are poor; the	kingdom of heaven is theirs.	8.972062405484884
5157. some of the poetic cadence of	the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone	with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the	meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar.	7.89749543504014
5158. to a novice	that is significant.	15.122340188067689
5159. in the second and third	chapters of revelation the new version retains however the old phrase	angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously	interpreted as meaning bishop.	8.245118345015822
5160. this is not contemporary english.	26.35124676436716
5161. contemporary	for the most part however the new version is	contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a	clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds	of years ago by the first followers of christ.	7.4685927208793155
5162. originally	recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated	and retranslated through the ages.	8.015797074357703
5163. discoveries recently made of	old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings	some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy	of the bible.	5.929549650054402
5164. to have the results recorded in everyday usable	english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.	11.842561856893017
5165. there	is one danger however.	12.10437708728783
5166. with contemporary english changing with the	rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the	new version may themselves soon become archaic.	9.837546072986095
5167. the only answer will	be continuous study.	10.386312145458636
5168. the new testament offered to the public	today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up	of representatives of the church of england church of scotland	methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian	church of england churches in wales churches in ireland	society of friends british and foreign bible society and national	society of scotland.	10.770770212796217

5257. one of the roughest	was the	tv quiz shows which gave him inferiority complexes.	10.353693306980343
5258. though	it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out	to be frauds and phonies it did irreparable damage to the ego of the	editor and many another intelligent well-informed american.	7.813877194148282

5272. he wants to be called sweet	good considerate and mother's little helper.	11.026388086785825
5273. but even mother's	loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.	8.060248137336135
5274. his desires	are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's	love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them.	8.545588825440642
5275. his own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed.	8.070604601550807

5280. she can remove all knick-knacks within reach.	11.148984887153823
5281. the	fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be.	7.630436505469847
5282. she	should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly	desirable to the child.	8.73035010830077
5283. if he can't play with mommy's magazines	he should have some old numbers of his own.	5.064674398337071
5284. if daddy's books	are out of bounds his own picture books are not.	10.023268188534976
5285. toys he has can be	made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator	and gas stove.	6.500704597875394

5290. there is no use trying to explain to a 2-year-old.	25.122849216079086
5291. remove the child from the scene	of his misbehavior.	8.535746049358883

5293. he won't submit to his natural	desires all the time and it's mother's love that is responsible	for his good behavior.	4.190453696740173
5294. this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities	and colleges schedule what they call homecoming day.	11.787637916645405
5295. they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.	9.066818820960721
5296. the football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with	the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian	when thrown to one of the emperor's lions.	9.935800748553783
5297. it is true of	course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and	then the christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined	by a visiting team.	8.767301330975704
5298. even with all possible precaution homecomings	are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient	and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.	8.554151086318976
5299. more	often than not as the old grad wanders along the old paths his	memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside	him becomes an ache and a pain.	6.251053696027841
5300. he can smell again the perfume she	wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the	aroma of autumn- fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia	of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall.	7.599394538830322
5301. it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple	of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily	as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting	and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat.	7.137506809833133
5302. usually	they titter loudly after they have passed by.	10.590274800417992
5303. he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him.	10.651176712408798
5304. his	bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous.	8.906989948136284
5305. his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had	walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the	old campus paths.	6.581812564620224
5306. bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is	like unripe persimmons in his mouth.	9.286218048333366
5307. it is not much better if	he meets with old classmates.	13.417236822449707
5308. too often unless he hails them they	pass him by.	12.000070419897868

5310. if they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace	the moment soon is done.	11.855522459015429
5311. after all when one has asked whatever became	of old joe and charlie h when one has inquired who it was sue	brown married and where it is they now live h when questions are asked	and answered about families and children and old professors h when	the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted h that does	it.	6.654336038654894
5312. by then one begins to notice the middle-age	spread; the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin	or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty; the athlete of by-gone	years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs	when he has finished a sentence	of any length h then it is time to break it up and move on.	6.329777582920484
5313. it is if anything worse on the old player h   he sits	in the stands and he doesn't like that.	6.9816433810753695
5314. enough of his life was spent	there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator	in the crowd.	11.236338984623167
5315. a team feels something.	10.56946677069156
5316. on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next	to him.	16.90678922967154
5317. in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about	him.	11.007264360339828
5318. he sits there remembering the tense moment before the	ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet the rasp of the	canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his	face.	6.238200833399479
5319. he remembers the desperate panting breath; the long runs	on the kick-offs; the hard jolting tackles; the breakthrough; the	desperate agony of goal-line stands.	3.522847133053917
5320. and so he squirms with each	play remembering his youth.	11.691008789936035
5321. but it is no use.	26.23961589257309
5322. no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and	strength they can never be recaptured again.	12.54054646811958
5323. since the obvious is not always true the republican national	committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that	it occurred as suspected in the larger cities.	6.565257447946952
5324. of 40 cities	with populations of 300000 and more mr kennedy carried 26 and mr	nixon 14.	9.81220946064096
5325. there are eight states in which the largest urban vote	can be the balance of power in any close election.	10.144347196120076
5326. these are new	york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois	and minnesota.	9.489641078591765
5327. in 1952 mr eisenhower won all but missouri.	10.294750919582954
5328. yet in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy.	11.403711062686602
5329. republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia.	8.859025371153393
5330. mr nixon	despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed	to do so.	10.261910225359417
5331. his visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey	in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which	in several cities is substantial.	7.660312805599832
5332. yet the gop breakdown discovered	that in philadelphia mr nixon received but 21 per cent of	the so-called polish vote; 30 per cent of the irish vote	and 18 per cent of the negro vote.	11.539913067204164
5333. a gop task force' committee will seek to find out how its	party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.	7.084496943976066
5334. the task force might make a start in washington with republican	congressional leaders.	13.42941002249001
5335. these gentlemen already have done the party	harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas	and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession	and unemployment.	6.628317680170531
5336. this error was compounded by declaring the recession	to be a statistical one and not a reality.	10.82443258348795
5337. the almost six	million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do	not consider themselves and their plight as statistical.	5.809879874105977
5338. they did not	view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor	goldberg as politics which the gop declared it to be.	10.20407392160562
5339. the	people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take	an interest in their misery.	7.8428450698593695
5340. senator mundt's gross distortion	of president eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation	of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr eisenhower	declared to be entirely false is another case in point.	6.265178250082552
5341. if the republicans	and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the	old under the social security program they will thereby erect still	another barrier to gop hopes in the cities.	6.894808944189705
5342. the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt goldwater	bridges dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party	leadership of the 1930s.	9.443755358268128
5343. in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr	hoover and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the	depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican	party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human	beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic	crash.	7.051690835185156
5344. the republican party was not lacking in humanity	but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear	devoid of any consideration for people in trouble.	9.677728537512868
5345. farmers called their	mule-drawn pickup trucks hoover carts.	5.311119977562703
5346. smokers reduced to	the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as hoover dust.	8.569305928095813
5347. one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership	hasn't meant to repeat this error.	7.313017912385455
5348. but it is in the process of so	doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john	f kennedy.	16.810963508733103
5349. that this is not good politics is underscored by the	latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like	the way in which the new president is conducting the nation's business.	9.434845178014928
5350. the most articulate republicans are those who in their	desire to get back at mr kennedy already have created the image	of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed	and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people	who need medical care.	8.988818462980944
5351. if they also defeat the school bill the	gop task force won't have much research to do.	6.322205308803165
5352. it will early	know why the party won't win back city votes.	10.398957963914798
5353. the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider.	8.167336983329237
5354. the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in	any responsible manner.	15.605604468110197
5355. after the griffin-byrd political troup	has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative	forum this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature	in history.	7.311631759537038
5356. every legislator from brasstown bald to	folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny	as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions.	9.032974635603257
5357. hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system	stands less chance than ever.	5.573996713150262
5358. and just how far can the legislature	go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the	midst of a governor's race?	9.09917190190463
5359.    how unpartisan will be the	recommendations	of lt gov garland byrd's senate committee	on government operations?	5.747649790577675
5360.    the situation already was bad because	the legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months	causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.	7.449975008526459
5361. but	when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted	the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join	the tour next november the situation was aggravated.	6.123276371219731
5362. neither	had a choice other than to accept the invitation.	10.993184077250115
5363. to have refused	would have been political suicide.	10.205719322247695
5364. and it may be that one or both men	actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast	aside.	14.31589227727771
5365. the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard	against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.	9.77985080118154
5366. it wanted	the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious	candidates.	16.00010930737954
5367. but state party chairman james gray of albany	said no and he didn't mince any words.	5.406843928735983
5368. they are just asking	too much he said.	13.759303701327637
5369. we can't think of anyone else who would want	to separate serious candidates from other candidates either.	4.919079454642135
5370. there are other dangers:   politics is an accelerating game.	13.07586242870522
5371. if an opponent accuses you of lying don't deny it.	6.451484436930787
5372. say he is	a horse thief runs an old adage.	9.013407496010805
5373. if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where	the promises would end.	8.363788839939998
5374. griffin's rural roads authority and byrd's	60000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths.	6.231671042646697
5375. the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such	a good one.	8.712910437477731
5376. why not have them travel the state in november debating?	15.532688508233127
5377. 	it would present a forum for them in almost every community.	7.799847520442616
5378. but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's	race being run in the next legislature the spectre of big spending	programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.	8.252302769469779
5379. there isa way out of this.	16.59231576724595
5380. the chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative	forum.	13.257129900902854
5381. it has arranged a campaign for governor.	14.752442392288062
5382. if	it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed	next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates	it can provide a service to the state.	8.808981446116551
5383. but the legislature should	be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing	up sides for the race.	8.212164779124954
5384. former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was	not a	great soldier.	8.03416184266061
5385. ike's somewhat like george washington.	5.314351768053588
5386. both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from british strategy.	7.65733933552869
5387. congressmen returning from recess say the people admire	president kennedy so much they're even willing to heed his call	to sacrifice- and give up his program.	4.531153953316498
5388. slogan of the john	birch society: paddle your own canoe.	6.792601411677436
5389. the guy who makes the	motor boats may be a communist.	9.019501568763811
5390. a republican survey says	kennedy	won the '60 election on the religious issue.	8.317918090445483
5391. too many people were	afraid if the gop won they'd have to spend all their time praying.	7.019661904760268
5392. the providence journal editorial entitled east	greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a	dilemma that faces communities such as ours.	8.74211507448378
5393. your suggested solution	it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your	generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning.	6.462328865606316
5394. first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already	zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested.	11.149247481562853
5395. this land is in various stages of development in several locations	throughout the town.	8.274227080566945
5396. the demand for these lots can be met for some	time to come.	12.49259485071577
5397. this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither	to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards	for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy	land and build in the new sites.	7.390353087107625
5398. what we are attempting to	do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density	residential areas and industrial and commercial development.	9.502605638919626
5399. it	is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial	development to help pay governmental costs.	7.4106106649831744
5400. bostitch inc is	approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate	tax.	6.865063589773627
5401. the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter	but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory.	6.671858556628575
5402. the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this	property in excess of two million dollars.	10.093469405315817
5403. with our current $3 per	hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you	suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant	as the best way to meet these problems.	7.248573052011503
5404. in order to attract	additional industry that is compatible with this community it is	all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly	balance in the tax structure.	10.577196903238045
5405. as this tax base grows so then can your	medium and low density residential areas grow.	6.91762913216172
5406. mr richard preston	executive director of the new hampshire state planning and	development commission in his remarks to the governors conference	on industrial development at providence on october 8 1960 warned	against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce	the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when	he said: if this is the fundamental reason for a community's	interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult	to obtain.	7.830541854643368
5407. he went on to say: in the first place industry	per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.	8.467749156805763
5408. it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased	municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be.	15.125340874577423
5409. while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school	costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon	a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes	to find alarm in uncontrolled growth.	6.720582712450655
5410. we in east greenwich have the	example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double	sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year.	9.368725899828055
5411. it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich	school committee is considering additions to at least one	elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations	for a school population that we know will increase.	9.095608126254918
5412. if they are to	be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment	of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?	10.972051558009326
5413. 	where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies	within the community that you have called for in other editorials?	7.4536889649363935
5414. 	i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not	facing the facts of life.	9.431406333529138
5415. the fruitful course of metropolitanization	that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of	east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it	was called.	6.834801256742619
5416. for example:  the east greenwich police department	utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police	department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and	ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut	area of the two communities.	6.160372570468835
5417. the east greenwich	fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich.	8.782494484369032
5418. the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money	as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent	county memorial hospital a regional facility.	9.515031658321766
5419. the east	greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of	east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment.	8.267632993129542
5420. feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick	as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish	disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of	warwick along with east greenwich.	8.694139270475485
5421. east greenwich was one	of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with	the rhode island development council for planning services we	could not provide for ourselves.	6.765607449737861
5422. the education program for retarded	children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils	from at least one neighboring community.	11.104325402882848
5423. i feel compelled	to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community	growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town	such as east greenwich.	8.597842199207735
5424. i believe it is an area in which professional	planners have failed to set adequate guide posts; and yet they cannot	ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly	all the planning programs they have devised.	10.123284566847227
5425. these programs are	volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must	stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what	manner the community shall grow.	6.528526188361796
5426. we have far less to fear in the migrant	family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.	13.81749394476777
5427. until professional planners meet this situation squarely	and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts	i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.	7.36197338648288
5428. i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to	send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the	gabrielle fund.	12.880369123190533
5429. it is indeed true as stated in the famous	novel of our day for whom the bell tolls that no man	is an island entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent	a part of the main.	7.792587050686576
5430. thanks to the generosity of mr	irving j fain president of the temple beth el; rev	dewitt clemens pastor of the mathewson street methodist church;	mr felix miranda of the imperial knife co; and to mrs	rozella switzer regional director of the national conference	of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for	the fund.	7.317048519143896
5431. it is through them that we have become aware of the divine	humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful	and good.	11.725066660288574
5432. bless you my friends for it is through love and service	that brotherhood becomes a reality.	9.999596625924045
5433. i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school.	10.317957091681158
5434. my future	plans are to become a language teacher.	11.527732711927273
5435. of course having this desire	i am very interested in education.	9.400104207056751
5436. a few weeks ago i read	in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston.	14.336451907845845
5437. the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or	over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes.	9.169917377294603
5438. the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students	of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade.	9.553353889290216
5439. i wish you could see the situation as i see it.	12.443618514395219
5440. if russian	pupils have to take these languages how come american students have	a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many	exceptions?	12.068050403058715
5441.    i do not think that america is like russia	not in the least! i am proud of my country the small city i live	in my wonderful parents my friends and my school; but i am also	a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language	but is not old enough.	6.488745957224622
5442. then people wonder why russian pupils	are more advanced than american students.	9.40734289683819
5443. well there lies your answer.	9.63205012638938
5444. at the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible	for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.	12.624664146652439
5445. however	the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my	home in time of desperation.	7.927024876338591
5446. words cannot tell of the undivided	attention and comfort their service gave to me.	9.044300086331173
5447. the concern they	felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always	be grateful.	7.645383734798038
5448. the rescue squad is to be praised immensely	for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather.	11.826786409345763
5449. had they not gotten	me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to	commend them at this time.	7.78078273312583
5450. many thanks for a job well	done.	15.18990141849532
5451. the providence sunday journal article asking whether	american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway	to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities	sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for	news.	6.073888643288187
5452. usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front	page.	10.585892976415915
5453. on the question of admission to veterans administration	hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled	veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly	affected by war service.	7.487446739095652
5454. it can manifest itself before discharge from	service or it can come out years later.	12.675177439360231
5455. there is one other point	we should never lose sight of: many veterans who enter va hospitals	as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected.	6.883259892819507
5456. no psychiatrist	could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its	effect in the ensuing years.	10.702521834443433
5457. the arguments advanced by those individuals	and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically	curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected	case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with	the wishes of the general public.	5.861698008219565
5458. i believe in priority for	service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals.	10.404360787057149
5459. but i don't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected	patients.	5.671145303479397
5460. this matter is of great importance and the outcome may	mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries	for many veterans.	11.190141985551803
5461. some critics say that the length of stay	in a hospital is too long.	8.786662341728478
5462. there's a reason for this length of stay.	5.5637644970448585
5463. first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets	the patient as a new patient.	8.74861234357212
5464. he has no experience with this veteran's	previous medical record.	12.32026496478621
5465. if the doctor is conscientious he wants	to study the patient.	9.364000655087544
5466. as a result it takes a little longer than	it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient.	14.637794510870929
5467. secondly the va physician knows that when the patient	leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit	his patient.	8.344200917349543
5468. so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects	of treatment or surgery.	10.4491062439079
5469. the american public must be presented	with the facts concerning va hospitalization.	8.58134002669257
5470. the public	should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va	hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other.	10.519335042279812
5471. the	responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va	hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital.	8.252672000076254
5472. an	adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the	veterans than any 50 state hospitals.	9.344912657665775
5473. it seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is	once more upon us.	8.705221694766816
5474. the american medical association is once again	grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the	veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer.	8.757490948823433
5475. do they the ama offer any solution other than outright	abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?	7.463903817303123
5476. 	we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand	for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age	fosters illness.	9.017123065806173
5477. nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama	on the health problem confronting the aged.	7.994059977166983
5478. they opposed	the forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial	support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction;	yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will	cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars	to initiate.	7.737396206918111
5479. no doubt there have	been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house	has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even	panic.	8.201365979210232
5480. this we can sympathetically understand.	19.170281557796372
5481. but no president ever	before referred to his as a lousy job as walter trohan recently	quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen	barry goldwater.	7.031969162602422
5482. during his aggressive campaign to win	his present position mr kennedy was vitriolic about this country's	prestige abroad.	9.85346910256678
5483. what does he think a remark like this lousy	one does to our prestige and morale?	8.917802087880073
5484.    if the president	of the united states really feels he won himself a lousy job	then heaven help us all.	12.345120240283558
5485. defense secretary robert s mcnamara	has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters	costing about 200 million dollars.	6.100759597632019
5486. why should congress even consider	allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection?	10.818818980558031
5487. 	top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of	massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would	persist for a long time.	5.89654415729438
5488. the scientists have also warned that no life	above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected	to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter.	8.936834748604085
5489. this	sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace	or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries	would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased	world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe.	6.528021291266214
5490. let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the	end of civilization.	12.084381854342265
5491. it seems college isn't what it should be.	9.272697866948926
5492. i refer to	the attire worn by the students.	12.740804801346538
5493. upon a visit to a local junior college	last week i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts	and the young men wearing bermuda shorts.	6.99770867951339
5494. is this what	our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college	in a few years?	12.794565257627214
5495. 	education should be uppermost in their minds but	with this attire how can anyone think it is so?	7.015233392892664
5496.  it looks more like	they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering	themselves.	14.926859371235247
5497. high school students have more sense of the	way to dress than college students.	8.242713961157792
5498. many high school students go past	my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen.	10.182062953373586
5499. no matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts.	12.305581438243571
5500. the granting of	the jan masaryk award august 13 to senator paul douglas is a bitter	example of misleading minorities.	7.770455671852962
5501. douglas has consistently	voted to aid the people who killed masaryk and against principles	masaryk died to uphold.	7.956970560698978
5502. douglas has voted for aid to communists and	for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid	etc.	10.68883048054674
5503. aug	8 the cta is urged to reduce fares	for senior citizens.	6.2486777694926205
5504. rising costs have increased the difficulties	of the elderly and i would be the last to say they should not receive	consideration.	11.187506834508728
5505. but why is it the special responsibility of the cta	to help these people?	11.674543172145995
5506.    why should cta regular riders	subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the	people who drive their own cars or walk to work should?	9.29072061394205
5507.  the welfare	of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community	not only of that part of it that rides the cta.	10.247652830124542
5508. cta regulars	already subsidize transportation for school children policemen	and firemen.	8.830652168497808
5509. in	reply to a letter in today's voice urging the sale of meat after	6 p m i wish to state the other side of the story.	7.052439468641045
5510. i	am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market.	15.419114181073015
5511. my husband's	hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a	m to 7 p m the early part of the week and as late as 8 or	9 on week-ends.	8.884937375611715
5512. now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-	and sundays too for this is coming.	11.924479835685942
5513. there is a trend to	packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying	stores where meat cutters will not be required.	9.474922178617495
5514. if a customer	wishes a special cut it will not be available.	15.558164778079414
5515. we are slowly being	regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not.	8.19685727203571
5516. most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week	on week-ends when prices are lower.	8.936841222739794
5517. also many working wives have children	or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them.	6.655338595946385
5518. independent market owners work six days a week; and my husband hasn't	had a vacation in 14 years.	6.4176281752015
5519. no we are not greedy.	12.205070787818771
5520. but if we closed	the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain	stores in the next block.	12.65425337668186
5521. the meat cutters' union which has	a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area	represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets.	6.855077712535284
5522. what it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well	as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice	of cut being made by the consumer not the store.	12.292951884050316
5523. convention and sidney holzman	- i too	congratulate the american legion of which i am proud to have been	a member for more than 40 years on the recent state convention.	6.412535813186547
5524. i regret that bertha madeira today's voice obtained	incorrect information.	7.365311258968857
5525. had i been granted the floor on a point of	personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified.	7.594139838444027
5526. the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require	the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the	american flag.	8.952824042693544
5527. judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of	election commissioners are instructed to do this.	7.589647417379617
5528. the resolution	further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment	to their premises for the display of the flag.	8.3125073975171
5529. it was my desire	to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling	places are on private property and without an amendment to the law	we could not enforce this.	8.288679030687497
5530. my discussion with reference to the resolution	was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of	election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors	who make available their private premises and not by innuendo	criticize them.	7.559278521738182
5531. at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation	for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners	for the discharge of their duties.	9.702530049849175
5532. the illinois commission for handicapped	children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic	charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of	the establishment of the institute for special education at the university	for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally	retarded children.	7.824912902930994
5533. in these days of serious shortage	of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped	and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute	will be a major contribution to the field.	7.952194305220074
5534. the illinois	commission for handicapped children which for 20 years has had the	responsibility of coo^rdinating the services of tax supported and voluntary	organizations serving handicapped children of studying the	needs	of handicapped children in illinois and of promoting more adequate	services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will	help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education	for all of its children.	7.953791939014249
5535. i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed	your june 25 article on liberace and to thank you for it.	8.395532855263436
5536. please	do put more pictures and articles in about liberace as he is truly	one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person.	7.881102826547004
5537. is this	perhaps	one of the things that is wrong with our country?	10.356491080065412
5538.    engineering	graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving	the highest average starting salaries in the school's history-	$550 a month.	6.866339598607692
5539. my son who has completed two years in engineering	school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled	laborer.	7.230115597584399
5540. at a rate of $3.	25.758095784502817
5541. 22 an hour he is now earning approximately	$580 a month.	6.906043632351873
5542. ironic is it not that after completing years	of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what	he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer?	9.889005441244386
5543. 	case	editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this	page.	6.892973801740082
5544. your july 26 editorial regarding	the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective	tax relief for du pont stockholders is based on an erroneous	statement of fact.	8.965446484920236
5545. as a result your criticism of attorney general	robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate	unwarranted and unfair.	9.91892600424339
5546. the editorial concerned legislative proposals	to ease the tax burden on du pont stockholders in connection	with the united states supreme court ruling that du pont must divest	itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings.	9.659684495406667
5547. these proposals	would reduce the amount of tax that du pont stockholders might	have to pay- from an estimated 1.	6.551353557875842
5548. 1 billion dollars under present	law to as little as 192 million dollars.	12.399432400277798
5549. congressman wilbur d	mills chairman of the house ways and means committee asked	the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals	as they related to anti-trust law enforcement.	6.204552105697572
5550. the attorney general	responded by letter dated july 19.	10.665701287512123
5551. copies of this letter were made	avaliable to the press and public.	7.28134427761275
5552. in this letter mr kennedy	made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration-	what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust	judgments.	9.638443291186963
5553. there are a number of other considerations besides	this one but it is for the congress not the department of justice	to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.	10.211152071261191
5554. yet your editorial said: now the attorney general	writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this	proportion'.	6.924266134707288
5555. what mr kennedy in fact wrote was: it	is the department's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations	justify any loss of revenue of this proportion.	4.609675971137961
5556. the	editorial by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement totally	distorted mr kennedy's views.	5.3160775205099915
5557. the headline is offensive particularly	in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial.	8.425826236316876
5558. church	- i concur most heartily	with today's letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen	and sen douglas.	5.370954745931105
5559. but when you write to congresswoman	church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely.	7.576737087120155
5560. should she disagree she explains why in detail.	10.583541556226608
5561. when she agrees	you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.	8.80338732816856
5562. i think	we have the hardest working best representative in congress.	10.865988309656265
5563. drinks	- a recent news story	reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed 103 airplane	passengers 10 minutes in london while they finished their drinks.	4.6213870791621074
5564. they do our country great harm by such actions.	16.52163529031678
5565. those in the public	eye should be good examples of american citizens while abroad.	8.847087389097979
5566. the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra	and martin to guzzle.	10.737049114511452
5567. overt socialism means government ownership and management	of a nation's main industries.	4.633604524494954
5568. in covert socialism- toward	which america is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership	title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive	regulations actually controls them.	6.116561264345961
5569. in order to attract	new industries 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build	government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.	6.935444391592782
5570. this	is a step toward overt socialism.	15.530163264846609
5571. issuing bonds for plant construction	has brought new industries to certain regions.	6.161945682982806
5572. sir- we are	writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff	of the public health nursing service of jersey city	.	7.241911202250529
5573. the day before election day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday	we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers	of the party.	7.528932133419381
5574. being ethical and professional people	interested in community health and well-being we felt this wasn't	a function of our position.	6.009935344289227
5575. such tactics reek of totalitarianism!	as we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes.	6.3286642498921415
5576. to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed	because of political affiliation.	9.384340866168673
5577. we therefore considered the suggestion	an insult to our intelligence ethics bill of rights	etc.	7.109424345186631
5578. our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion	for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.	8.833424183190234
5579. this is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens	of the united states.	6.198327142355789
5580. _to the	sir- i read of a man who felt he should not build	a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to	sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.	8.090194494610008
5581. does this man live in	a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves	but ready to demand that the community help and protect them?	8.047020428463028
5582. 	community shelters are of course necessary for those	having	no space for shelter.	9.19506376347612
5583. if in a town of 2000 private homes half of	them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced	to that extent.	9.586876629140647
5584. in designing his home fallout shelter there	is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants	plus-one- so he will be able to take in a stranger.	9.586221009149268
5585. i	hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes	will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of	our plus-one shelter club.	6.3890475507292015
5586. sir- people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer	space.	8.415907545960351
5587. it's simple enough from my point of view.	2.9742208042042355
5588. it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's	world.	22.529589942881067
5589. sir- when	the colonies decided upon freedom from england we insisted through	the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize	us as a separate political entity.	6.393558536757573
5590. it is high time the united	states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth	in that document are applicable today to katanga.	10.868237034465627
5591. in the united	nations charter the right of self-determination is also an essential	principle.	8.013517950257434
5592. this again applies to katanga.	14.503086236101028
5593. the people of katanga	had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist	yoke of antoine gizenga and his cohorts.	8.352090163065297
5594. by political economic geographic	and natural standards they were justified in doing so.	9.322868512155123
5595. the united states and the un denounce their own principles	when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge	the right of self-determination of the katangans.	6.3611757052079
5596. college costs	sir- permit me to commend	your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county	colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers	have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit	them to.	9.729866147017455
5597. the bill which passed the assembly last may and	is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny.	8.649890181395259
5598. the procedure	for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges	and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.	10.609192672266657
5599. under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county	college will be appointed; none will be elected.	10.483662471421756
5600. the trustees	will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board	of school estimate.	11.01758858818779
5601. this board will consist of two of the trustees	of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.	11.334415267239295
5602. it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college	and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall	appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made	by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied	and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes.	13.804790452722886
5603. the approval of only three members of the board of	school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted	to the college.	11.498544203772955
5604. since two of these could be trustees of the college	actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected	official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue.	12.95271388355501
5605. this is taxation without representation.	15.068863012138195
5606. sir- your editorial	housing speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.	6.759388332693178
5607. the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary	case of slum conditions.	7.174044746155823
5608. change our taxing law so that no tax	shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.	7.677034479571564
5609. then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance	at no cost to taxpayers will happen.	8.73119641952704
5610. our entire economy will have	a terrific uplift.	9.70917025384087
5611. sir- an old man is kicked to death by muggers.	4.312861910142183
5612. the medical examiner	states that death was due to natural causes.	13.462345350587729
5613. i once	heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york	it is listed as death due to natural causes.	7.8674901482206625
5614. exhibit	sir- every resident of this city	should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit our changing	skyline in newark.	7.104025543173395
5615. it will be at the museum until march 30.	17.623277218141016
5616. it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done	and what will be done in newark as shown by architects' plans models	and pictures.	11.951794543648386
5617. it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and	certainly make every newarker proud of this city.	7.680272136236493
5618. it should	also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious	life of the community so that that phase of newark will live	up to the challenge presented by this exhibit.	9.886864708250139
5619. sir- i hasten to join in praise of the	men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway.	5.610614867251312
5620. recently i traveled	the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most	courteous group of men you will find anywhere.	11.646092325758547
5621. one even gave my little	dog a biscuit.	8.83255524169622
5622. the viewers of the deep peep show	at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction- the view	of a fossilized cypress swamp.	6.947176142251462
5623. twenty feet below the street level	in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black	coal-like deposit has been encountered.	6.762343455390932
5624. this is a black swamp	clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees	were growing.	13.272423927373852
5625. the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found	embedded in the clay.	8.959166190978605
5626. some of the stumps are as much as three feet	long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying	sediments.	14.479321788484452
5627. although the wood has been changed to coal much	of it still retains its original cell structure.	7.058277451710812
5628. in the clay are	entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants	growing in the region at the time.	11.49598959599285
5629. these microfossils indicate the	swamp was formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs	were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.	6.233213370439203
5630. the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with	the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported	in the washington post august 2 1955 which was probably	formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.	8.51537655052043
5631. recently the secretary of the friends	committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air.	8.881737654722492
5632. while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points	that i would like to question.	10.521244080163239
5633. he said let's work for	peace instead of protection from aggression.	7.869292985343112
5634. i would ask why	not do both?	17.46382730919229
5635.  military power does not cause war; war is the result	of mistrust and lack of understanding between people.	6.234345765587498
5636. are we not	late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough	about this lack of understanding?	11.519397874287906
5637.   as to protection	the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters	would not save everyone.	8.19226908201823
5638. is this a reason for saving no one?	15.470896209609174
5639.  would	the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his	boat could not pick up everyone?	6.512841864261461
5640.   the speaker suggested	that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.	8.35619165289135
5641. if the world comes to this wouldn't it be the very time when courage	and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?	7.244437416544478
5642. 	many of our young people think it would.	9.331368019541484
5643. lastly the speaker	decried our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian	defense.	5.888857644293325
5644. in 1950 public law 920 created civil defense	a responsibility	of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property	in disaster natural or manmade.	9.038871034874065
5645. far from creating fear	as the speaker suggests preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency-	gives people confidence.	6.542080600109949
5646. civil defense has far to go and	many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer	tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families	and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm flood accident	or even war?	8.311218269127913
5647. 	it seems rather peculiar	that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves	with the protection and companionship of dogs.	6.008706085702517
5648. i feel that few	burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment	if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide.	8.894852731820682
5649. in	addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded	a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets	if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?	7.487904022716056
5650.    i grant that	the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you	were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady	to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with	a dog?	8.28539618497306
5651.  i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners	get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting	dogs in apartments.	9.971985225211203
5652. use the terraces of the	capitol for a sidewalk cafe?	11.57718481361425
5653.  could senator humphrey be serious	in his proposal?	7.236634663887764
5654.  is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'	comfort?	14.82948856314991
5655.    perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could	be extended.	10.387129723808796
5656. the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak.	11.284685203877022
5657. why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel	too far to eat?	9.091495036798904
5658.  unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money	to support themselves during the off season.	9.998839682425505
5659. as an added suggestion	to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space	on the washington monument.	8.433824088040874
5660. it is visible throughout the city and	men from madison ave would jump at the chance.	13.418805373496612
5661. sen	hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart.	8.910856569312818
5662. he like	most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by	the great outdoors.	11.485978516560461
5663. let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas	around fountains and gardens.	7.987822413773577
5664. let us like the french have outdoor	cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing	crowd.	10.23169362821084
5665. two strong dissents from	the majority report of the joint economic committee by	senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy	of the thirties did not work.	6.104301815838571
5666. soviets said to fear resurgence of	german militarism	for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large	powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional	warfare of the past a nullity.	9.263699180498763
5667. the united states and soviet	russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations.	10.857565811941233
5668. recent	statements	by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power	of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient	to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead	of negotiations.	6.426722046622515
5669. president kennedy was right when he said we	shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate.	10.765907001428667
5670. i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and	the far east.	12.83319561951816
5671. it is quite evident that the people of western europe	are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war.	12.204276603915345
5672. the	fact is that the italians french and british know that they have	no defense against nuclear bombs.	10.1645790075642
5673. we have no right to criticize them	as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.	9.212105067468988
5674. we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access	into berlin.	11.58779169829378
5675. it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to	prevent us.	12.183734725914569
5676. but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from	granting de facto recognition to east germany.	16.54604387792389
5677. soviet russia has	been invaded twice by german troops in a generation.	6.895127758132616
5678. in the last war	russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories	were devastated.	12.60048827971076
5679. the truth is that communist	russia fears the resurgence of german militarism.	11.572398344170704
5680. berlin is merely	being used by moscow as a stalking horse.	10.464977260744552
5681. actually the	communists	out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing	to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral	and have its independence guaranteed by the u n.	7.182042597491007
5682. if	the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed	germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this	nuclear age.	8.158060045093485
5683. it could provide security without cost of armaments and	increase german prosperity and lessen taxation.	8.61713760518932
5684. france and other western	european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany.	8.37663170815491
5685. if the german	people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following	the example of austria.	8.538384053783602
5686. president kennedy has urged a	peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival	which has many facets.	11.530897755751017
5687. why not make a beginning with a united and	disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing	would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states?	7.654106718177663
5688. 	a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward	disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world.	9.790123799622055
5689. u n obligations	_to the editor of the new york	in your editorial of sept 30 the smoldering congo	you make the following comment: far too many states are following	the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments.	5.906807137466398
5690. it	is up to the assembly to take action against them.	12.099485434104732
5691. they are violating	their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension	of membership or expulsion.	7.330889940740722
5692. i would like to quote from	the charter of the united nations:   article 17 section	1: the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget	of the organization.	9.091642418723003
5693. section 2: the expenses of the	organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general	assembly.	6.177421743461746
5694. article 19: a member of the united nations	which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions	to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if	the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions	due from it for the preceding two full years.	9.542757496930856
5695. the u	s s r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations	to the regular budget.	6.646991808377616
5696. but they refuse as do the arab states	to support the united nations' expenses of maintaining the united	nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between	egypt and israel and the u n troops in the congo which	expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations	but by a special budget.	11.603527088044828
5697. according to the official interpretation	of the charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the	right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial	obligations to the special united nations' budgets and of	course cannot be expelled from the organization	due to the fact that there is no provision in the	charter for expulsion.	7.74934031254474
5698. connally	amendment's repeal held step toward world orderto the	in your sept 27 editorial appraisal	of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress	you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time	of acute national and world peril.	7.672136524253142
5699. yet your list of things left	undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country's	domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute	of the international court of justice.	6.559975278952671
5700. the connally	amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall	determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction	of the united states in a case before the world court to which	the united states is a party.	12.575094366584958
5701. if the case is thus determined by us	to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction.	10.10930204653035
5702. since the connally	amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other	party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from	using the court effectively.	11.838521903898553
5703. yet although the kennedy administration	and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves	solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to	our best interests no action has yet been taken.	7.655682679262351
5704. our destiny	in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit	of peace with justice under law.	9.005456003407149
5705. to achieve this destiny acts	as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength	but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.	6.21658417615294
5706. what better affirmative step could be taken to this end	than repeal of the connally amendment- an act which could expose	the	united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging	attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance	in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?	8.136656534876604
5707. 	we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the	eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate	of the connally amendment.	5.4334391834957705
5708. _to	many home-bound subway riders	utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with	the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their	express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained.	6.306627651867166
5709. to the	tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street	and change for the ind this takes a daily toll of time and temper.	6.53403959914951
5710. the transit authority has recently placed in operation	hold lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street	stations in brooklyn.	6.338172527328737
5711. this holds the local until the express	passengers change trains.	8.360103842367193
5712. without question this time and temper saver	should be immediately installed at the woodside station.	10.628913431478084
5713. service criticized	as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly from three	to four hours a day.	8.540394318276096
5714. in the last few years the telephone company	has managed to automate many areas of their service.	16.15953790268324
5715. it has not	been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization	which has brought about new ways of dialing.	9.229757517697623
5716. however there	are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone	operators.	10.567271568384744
5717. i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the	young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls special long-distance	calls etc.	6.067835674843115
5718. either it is lack of training lack of proper	screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest	on the part of the telephone company which does have a government-blessed	monopoly.	11.402773811775022
5719. i disagree with the	writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled.	9.181193069559974
5720. the funeral	for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price far	less than i had expected to pay.	9.499023373481268
5721. but the hospitals and doctors should	be.	13.25184146258383
5722. recently	i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children.	8.527724684632739
5723. hazel park donates its recreation center five days a	week to the school.	6.172531595902247
5724. there is no charge and no state aid.	23.147787233327406
5725. kiwanis	american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do	what they can to bring in dollars for its support.	6.561753789557856
5726. there are	70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school.	14.186232960245134
5727. reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts	as working in brass.	6.330047039038699
5728. enough	trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon.	7.390687177113959
5729. southfield	schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus	needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need	.	6.006798272234786
5730. the school is located at 9-12 mile road woodward	heights.	11.85632245053447
5731. visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated	mothers can do.	7.283736458582196
5732. i	was surprised at mayor miriani's defeat but perhaps mayor-elect	cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years	ago.	6.698582918463426
5733. maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city	departments such as welfare dpw and sanitation.	7.611682398952307
5734. negligence in	garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.	8.039785575588922
5735. he	should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at	night.	6.980700919462012
5736. there should be better bus service and all of our city departments	and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.	12.740956005753322
5737. our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to	read of a conviction in a littering case.	6.810861437447564
5738. drunken truck drivers	in the city departments should be weeded out.	8.603875348218013
5739. educate the city employes	to give real service to the public.	7.745773283281866
5740. after all they are paid by	the public they should be examples.	13.442808282814259
5741. are helpful	at a recent meeting of the women's	association of the trumbull ave united presbyterian	church considerable use was made of material from the detroit news	on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english	bible.	6.8407669848665105
5742. some members of the organization called attention	also to the article on hymns of inspiration the daily prayer and	three minutes a day as being very helpful.	10.669917761888922
5743. we feel that	the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles	on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material	along wholesome lines.	8.45158271302504
5744. thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy	to impudence.	13.286151836845796
5745. how old do you have to be to remember when americans	especially children were encouraged to be polite?	10.41353929008742
5746.  why has	this form of gentility gone out of american life?	12.153204292096438
5747.    how can	we old-fashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect	from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on	tv without denying the children the use of television entirely?	5.916070084088875
5748. 	writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern	parents they have observed.	8.993431240856872
5749. from necessity they are also inspired	by the hard-sell attitude of the sponsor so finally it	is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste	of his advertising.	7.013067827268099
5750. i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national	park in the dunes area.	9.976680129295083
5751. i just wish	to	congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in	cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles.	7.204253695158744
5752. we have now a quiet	city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping	in center city.	10.223772167246402
5753. maybe he will help	to turn our fair city into a ghost town.	7.74818538286465
5754. i worked on the schuylkill	expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock	and concrete there wouldn't be an expressway.	10.568736964665485
5755. without these massive	trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.	8.579687254316728
5756. mr george hough sounds like a business man who waits	until the last minute to leave his home or shop.	10.195850459415816
5757. the trucks today	help pay for this highway.	9.582219426074275
5758. they try to keep within the speed limits.	17.026510702615433
5759. although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver	has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road.	5.3474977192159345
5760. the	letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school	at 14 should have signed his letter simpleton instead of	simplicitude.	7.75255987530089
5761. such kids only wind up among the unemployed	on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden.	7.000427345097312
5762. there are	lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for	the dropouts.	11.442887880600535
5763. what we need is more vocational training in high schools	not more dropouts.	10.398721036038758
5764. _to the editor of the	i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly	cannot see how two wrongs can make a right! i am referring	to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because	russia is.	6.414055938448884
5765. will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less	harmful to future generations of children?	7.291956358233941
5766.  if an atom bomb in 1945	could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have	is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.	8.545870234415803
5767. as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack	enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have-	at least the bombs- can inflict all the demage that is necessary.	6.726263907672196
5768. why	do we need bigger and better bombs?	11.006626017652776
5769.  i repeat two wrongs do not	make a right.	8.918903468381007
5770. everyone should take time to read martin luther's hymn	a mighty fortress is our god.	7.486287954611884
5771. especially the	first half of the third verse:	_to	the editor of the inquirer: we led the	world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the	first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki.	6.105580432266122
5772. having led the world	in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead	it out of the race.	10.927586178242644
5773. are we to be the master of the atom or	will the atom be our master- and destroy us!	just because cheddi	jagan new boss of british guiana was educated in the united states	is no reason to think he isn't a red.	6.64104832838199
5774. we have quite a few home-grown	specimens of our own.	11.523566773601612
5775. if we go all gooey over this newest castro	we've got rocks in our heads.	7.302265990004454
5776. how	many times must we get burned before we learn?	9.280984168580652
5777. 	just to remind the communists	that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start	one.	6.535495014905081
5778. the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed	on both sides.	11.651132438786211
5779. intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets	of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london	or pearl harbor.	6.046151646439843
5780. that is why the united nations was formed so that	intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet	and solve problems without resorting to war.	11.461117295203543
5781. russia has showed	its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the	world.	7.343350205253139
5782. why aren't the soviets expelled from the un?	8.743267916303152
5783. 	while	better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous	award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold	strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation.	6.890061396034644
5784. had	it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations	was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in	pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task.	11.383469842197279
5785. according	to one report however mr hammarskjold was considered too	controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last	spring.	7.04834615892616
5786. actually of course that label controversial applied	only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world	organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet	union.	9.597519787817548
5787. at khrushchev's door therefore can be placed	the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves	to be intimidated.	6.397255912173039
5788. it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a	coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.	12.166329724449394
5789. as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize	true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.	9.758215732072504
5790. just a brief note of	appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver	bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of people to people	good will.	7.321211486432826
5791. if only this could be done more often- with such	heartening results- many of the earth's big problems would	shrink to the insignificances they really are.	5.038634050925402
5792. thanks	for your good coverage of ahmad's visit too!	answer: east river drive	your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway	are valuable; however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.	4.8378244912230315
5793. one of the problems associated with the expressway	stems from the basic idea.	14.039298750923924
5794. we shuffle a large percentage of the cars	across the river twice.	15.02090911458642
5795. they start on the east side of the schuylkill	have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over	again to the east at their destination.	11.368696728188091
5796. bridges tunnels and ferries	are the most common methods of river crossings.	8.748307177374365
5797. each one of these	is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion.	9.049494794754875
5798. we	should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep	cars starting and ending on the east side of the river- on the east	side.	9.077859708272843
5799. this can be accomplished by several logical steps:	so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage	paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead	directional lights as on our bridges.	6.071836863406007
5800. one additional lane would then	be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the	traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent.	9.525415121032792
5801. this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures	necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying	the natural beauty of the east river drive.	8.463704127248276
5802. washington square	i wish	to advocate two drastic changes in washington square:  take	away george washington's statue.	6.208996311312511
5803. replace it with the	statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.	5.558627122592659
5804. there's	no sense in being reminded of times that were.	7.767832982470402
5805. washington square seems	not part of a free land.	9.821431924319615
5806. it may remind one of russia china or	east berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that washington	and the continental soldiers fought for.	10.504557344970321
5807. the fairmount	park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it	is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square.	7.197392240287728
5808. the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but it's	a very good start on the road to totalitarianism h the commission	has posted signs in washington square saying:   the	feeding of birds is prohibited in this square.	9.149457068397828
5809. fairmount	park commission   does each tentacle of the octopus of	city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers	an annoyance?	5.694157474033883
5810.  if birds don't belong in a square or park what	does?	8.413428147023287
5811.  they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature.	12.089969467875807
5812. the trees are their homes; but the commission does not share	such sentiments.	8.65280484851072
5813. the whole official city apparently has an	intense hatred toward birds.	7.878948781703966
5814. starlings and blackbirds are scared off	by cannon from city hall.	7.701495335335465
5815. if any are	left presently we may expect to see signs specifically	the feeding of them too.	8.369634538482106
5816. the city government is not	united in an all-out to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs delinquents	thugs murderers rapists subversives.	6.9551921066158515
5817. let every	policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe lest one	piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.	6.295288636798659
5818. of	course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and	innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them	and afraid to protest and say how come?	7.987655828244242
5819.  what's your motive?	4.887802777768073
5820. 	wants this deed done?	9.663020614307381
5821. - in this small way do	the leaders of a city or of a nation iniure the masses to watching	or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men.	5.101117158760983
5822. one means to help the birds occurs to me: let the chimes that	ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music	but one.	7.428084900524616
5823. let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody	has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn abide with	me.	7.607336067978951
5824. we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what	the birds would ask:	_to	there is a trend today to bemoan	the fact that americans are too soft.	9.743423742634521
5825. unfortunately those who	would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics.	8.226010611196557
5826. they	are working on the wrong part of our anatomy.	11.749970279705567
5827. it is not our bodies	but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft.	12.30541801098054
5828. ashamed of our wealth	and power afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace	we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.	5.712667081871202
5829. when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which	we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations	which do not permit self-determination when we become strong enough	to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation when	we recognize that our enemy is communism not war and when we realize	that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom then	and only then will we no longer be soft.	6.3456385381860745
5830. america doesn't need	to push-up she needs to stand up!	the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is	fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has	some merit.	6.259889392148182
5831. however he states unequivocally the scandals in business	are far less significant than the scandals in labor.	8.267746080797076
5832. i must	in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so-called	scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.	8.248082657231306
5833. the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan	hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts.	9.246916010788835
5834. these arrangements	would have been impossible if the business community was truly	interested in the welfare of its employes.	9.725315273344592
5835. a sweetheart arrangement	can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous	labor leaders demanding tribute.	6.188285519524587
5836. anyone familiar with the details	of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart	arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented	the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.	10.048563372636828
5837. further it	should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress	to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the	landrum-griffin act.	6.224329561369997
5838. the nuclear war is already being fought	except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet.	9.217739182728273
5839. it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with	the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories.	8.660557925815464
5840. they predicted	escalation and escalation is what we are getting.	14.855289729801658
5841. the biggest nuclear	device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons	although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs	apiece.	6.343674442064848
5842. some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when	bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them.	12.460103703799655
5843. he seems	to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand since we cannot	assume that he has exploded his entire stock.	6.030043968915878
5844. and now of course	the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side.	8.55486891156957
5845. khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb?	7.8541997485916335
5846.  so be it- then	we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common	or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said	to be the coming thing.	6.469747807471398
5847. so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more	accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other	instead of on their respective proving grounds.	5.945219032741709
5848. what is needed	philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun	is a discontinuity.	10.680493581949348
5849. the escalation must end sometime and probably	quite soon.	7.758745084892474
5850. only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison	writes.	14.21403711843983
5851. the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction	or that of diplomatic policy.	7.87278932358265
5852. morrison points out	that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red	china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers- europe of	course must be written off out of hand.	8.624876843685996
5853. he feels therefore that to	seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the	least risky path our government can take.	9.374611959100875
5854. his proposal is opposed to	that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss	and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller	and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation	of the cold war.	8.545715711068974
5855. these gentlemen are calling for a resumption	of testing- in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale all	in the name of national security.	5.682896794772708
5856. escalation is their first love and	their last; they will be faithful unto death.	7.567364028416698
5857. capable as their	minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nation's	security are incapable of learning or even of observing.	6.474961328458903
5858. if this capacity	had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a	disastrous miscalculation.	10.965796575644774
5859. he has gained only one thing- he has exploded	a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust	to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges.	5.2027957958245326
5860. but if his	purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried	more obviously.	11.788017717494208
5861. not terror but anger and resentment have been the	general	reaction outside the soviet sphere.	7.193624554369231
5862. khrushchev himself is	reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet	our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his	footsteps.	8.015752178168052
5863. when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success	of another it is only natural.	8.19984902275268
5864. thus when the russians sent up their	first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination	to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable.	8.21800690373307
5865. but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of	his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly.	10.736265480133932
5866. when east germans fled to the west by the thousands paeans of	joy rose from the throats of western publicists.	11.743510726885257
5867. they are less vocal	now when it is the west berliners who are migrating.	10.195123480857742
5868. the flood	is not as great- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative	account- but it is symptomatic.	8.325629597070487
5869. west berlin morale is low and	in age distribution the situation is unfavorable.	9.2465277005718
5870. nearly 18 per cent	of west berlin's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older	only 12.	5.485991618990368
5871. 8 per cent are under fifteen.	12.847542059478535
5872. r h s crossman	mp writing in the manchester guardian states that	departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700	but of 1700 a week and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a	week.	9.108466304935396
5873. the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers	or independent professional people.	8.576711604599272
5874. whole families are moving and	removal firms are booked for months ahead.	9.119929441850704
5875. the weekly loss is partly	counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany but the	hard truth says crossman is that the closing off of east berlin	without interference from the west and with the use only of east	german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory	which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow.	6.068264850862655
5876. the	gallant half-city is dying on its feet.	7.11454309486365
5877. another piece of	evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer.	7.419214713793588
5878. mark arnold-foster writes: people are leaving west berlin	because they think it is dying.	7.697241979923311
5879. they are leaving so fast that	the president of the west german employers' federation issued an	appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six	months' front-line work in factories in west berlin.	6.3386805563874855
5880. berlin's	resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the	struggle will be hard indeed.	9.878474596793614
5881. the handwriting is on the wall.	11.252446612157634
5882. the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will	bring down the wall and reunite the city.	10.723024187385484
5883. state department officials	refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks	into east berlin under military escort will not avail.	6.424058182773931
5884. tanks lined	up at the border will be no more helpful.	11.515473934536653
5885. the materials for compromise	are at hand: the nation walter lippmann and other sober	commentators have spelled them out again	and again.	5.577776488072771
5886. a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of	triumph but it will save berlin.	10.437442387587623
5887. or the city can be a graveyard monument	to western intransigence if that is what the west wants.	8.358695581958441
5888. the removal of stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared	with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not	unprecedented in history.	7.720784107965146
5889. it is in fact a relatively mild chastisement	of the dead.	15.998399725435101
5890. a british writer richard haestier in a book	dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding	the french revolution the body of henry 4 who had died nearly	180 years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob.	8.23040731968124
5891. and in england after	the restoration the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at	tyburn.	8.309360735652316
5892. the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the	rest of the body was buried under the gallows.	12.587233606149685
5893. contemplating	these posthumous punishments stalin should not lose all hope.	6.608042144239068
5894. in 1899	parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing	whitehall and there presumably he still stands.	9.464891128035116
5895. nikita khrushchev	however has created yet another problem for himself.	6.6045222362665745
5896. the lenin tomb	is obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow is a crowded city	and the creed of communism deplores waste.	8.076758709538028
5897. who will take stalin's	place beside lenin?	8.56364893905821
5898.  there is karl marx of course buried in	london.	19.87314923219162
5899. the macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has	been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could	not make him look presentable.	6.441203806473564
5900. who then is of sufficient stature to	lodge with lenin?	11.193984944490925
5901.  who but nikita himself?	10.818499613359775
5902.  since he has just	shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor	in the gift of the soviet people.	12.050070896043179
5903. besides he can hardly avoid musing	on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations	seems to match that of life.	6.246189048575312
5904. suppose he did lie beside lenin	would it be permanent?	11.385029152771244
5905.  if some future khrushchev decided to	rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory	workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession?	7.199730963785113
5906.  when	a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put.	12.017031702563886
5907. if nikita buys	a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand.	6.9957577258668495
5908. the appointment of u thant of burma as the	un's acting secretary general- at this writing the choice	appears to be certain- offers further proof that in politics	it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential	friends.	8.03839585271049
5909. mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland	were early	favorites in the running but france didn't like the	former and the soviet union would have none of the latter.	5.895985472174248
5910. with the	neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed	mr	hammarskjold u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely	to be waylaid by a veto.	10.277116101111508
5911. what is interesting is that his positive	qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to	his candidacy.	10.454448431574232
5912. in all the bitter in-fighting the squabbles over election	procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played	on the assistant secretaries' theme the gentleman from burma showed	himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.	8.082090673670248
5913. he has	moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future.	7.895621438723565
5914. he is a buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of	human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable	weltanschauung.	10.744041351989296
5915. u thant of course will hold office until	the spring of 1963 when mr hammarskjold's term would have come	to an end.	6.559905313598328
5916. whether the compromises- on both sides- that made	possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen.	6.9706318348189455
5917. mr khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant not dead;	the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism	that u thant represents.	5.286919101322245
5918. in a sense the showdown promised by mr	hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents	have been set as yet; structurally the un is still	fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership	are bringing to bear upon it.	7.331192526426186
5919. but at least the pessimists who believed	that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane	crash in the congo have been proved wrong.	8.14043919811215
5920. no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are	their sole staple in trade.	10.412305315884133
5921. these are mentalities which crave action-	and they are beginning to get it as messrs salsich and engh	report on page 372.	6.08701202606885
5922. even in areas where political connotations are	left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading.	12.35600706433684
5923. friends a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers describes	a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone	company at foley alabama.	5.63900621224429
5924. if the day should ever come that	foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast the account reads	they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained	telephone employees- all girls.	8.420724845103585
5925. h heavily armed and mobilized	as a fast-moving civil defense outfit 23 operators and office	personnel h stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice.	4.970199626769835
5926. according to friends the unit was organized by john snook	a former world war 2 commando who is vice president and general	manager of the telephone company.	10.838709165018864
5927. the girls very fetching in their	uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;	they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols	rifles and other such ladies' accessories.	4.9429544579035865
5928. this may be opera	bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war	mount in frenzy.	12.5222891802143
5929. the country is committed to the doctrine of security	by military means.	9.455215572683747
5930. the doctrine has never worked; it is not working	now.	10.112542151352493
5931. the official military establishment can only threaten to use	its nuclear arms; it cannot bring them into actual play.	5.676295919540993
5932. a more dangerous	formula for national frustration cannot be imagined.	10.689034430685638
5933. as the civic	temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier- but	the guns are real.	6.442013843793292
5934. soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they	are assured are in our midst.	10.399512947656996
5935. all false gods resemble moloch at least in the early phases of their	careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship	to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.	7.159135766635396
5936. but there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish	cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands.	14.493485475135756
5937. the annual	butchery of 40000 american men women and children to satiate	its blood-lust is excessive; a quota of 25000 a year would be more	than sufficient.	5.597667665341579
5938. no other popular idol is accorded even that much	grace.	10.902700103460038
5939. if the railroads for example regularly slaughtered 25000	passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause	to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite	demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states.	7.085453641822216
5940. but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively	new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it	may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.	11.259486464310367
5941. yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective	the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical.	9.647731763969851
5942. here	then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of	a beginning.	8.787391405904662
5943. from next new year's day let us keep careful account	of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all	media of communication.	5.173139430609251
5944. to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand	of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five	thousandth corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery	be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners.	6.956686533416721
5945. then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution	on july 4 1963.	7.5039374363064555
5946. the scene of course should be nine miles northwest	of centralia illinois the geographical center of population according	to the census.	9.4604850433707
5947. a special grandstand protected by awnings from	the midsummer sun of illinois should be erected for occupancy by	honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new african	nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is	thoroughly civilized.	6.398403203292253
5948. the band should play the rogues' march as a	processional switching to hail columbia happy land! as	the trap is sprung.	6.220517753903745
5949. independence day is the appropriate date	as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments	are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable	rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive	of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish	it.	7.443546018049346
5950. the highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds	up 40000 americans every year the government is destroying its own	taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.	9.792073749551855
5951. hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government	but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual	citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for	the better.	5.605453814716755
5952. moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively	political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social.	10.587914334392098
5953. it	would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some	of its ancillary beliefs and practices- for instance the doctrine	that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon	not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the	cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put.	6.0570026696484405
5954. true the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor	even a miniscule sect and their credo home-keeping hearts are	happiest is as disreputable as socinianism.	7.366509976565942
5955. nonetheless although	few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the	hardshell baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital	principle embodied in their faith.	7.177180470145144
5956. perhaps there is more truth than we	are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia	robert ruark's grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse	of the modern world is all this gallivantin'.	8.231288651493017
5957. in any	event the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victims is a hecatomb too large	to be justified by the most ardent faith.	7.082364117544399
5958. somehow our contemporary moloch	must be induced to see reason.	8.921475733065908
5959. since appeals to morality to humanity	and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse	is the deterrent example.	6.060938698290253
5960. if we make it established custom that	whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond 25000	per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the	more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson.	9.513882752757429
5961. to hang 50	governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related	to the highways; so all things considered the highway commissioners	would seem to be elected.	6.755904675875359
5962. as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly	around the earth the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime	against the human race.	9.735918116661859
5963. but the guilt is shared by the united states	britain and france the other members of the atomic club.	11.688801482905575
5964. until	moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 the us and	uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere	as the russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still	coming down.	7.883108296137696
5965. as it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds	up in the human body; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu	virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies.	6.5351952370459285
5966. the effect of	radiation is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding generations.	8.766273827996566
5967. so while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history	is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the	west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical	and irresponsible threat.	6.248364185693623
5968. shock dismay and foreboding for future	generations were legitimate reactions; a holier-than-thou sermon was	not.	5.4653407691931415
5969. on october 19 after the soviets had detonated at least	20 nuclear devices ambassador stevenson warned the un general	assembly that this country in self protection might have	to resume above-ground tests.	6.098974415087512
5970. more recently the chairman of the atomic	energy commission dr glenn t seaborg admitted	to a news conference in las vegas nevada that the us might	fall behind russia if the	soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain.	9.651566730805618
5971. the	trial balloons are afloat.	7.733163869930895
5972. all of which makes it more imperative	than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.	12.23894370541977
5973. but for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of science's	worst-marked channels full of tricky currents and unknown	depths.	9.085611072533036
5974. the scientists in and out of government do not agree on some	of the most vital points at least publicly.	12.563048521210538
5975. on the one hand the public	health service declared as recently as october 26 that present	radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots do not warrant	undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive	substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the	us.	6.81362245824569
5976. but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles	will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations	and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united	states.	11.779514245803218
5977. then it added: it is not possible to determine	how extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people will	be affected.	6.212390695892517
5978. having hedged its bets in this way phs	apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination	after all: at present radiation levels and even at somewhat	higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will	be affected.	8.384990764256214
5979. then to conclude on an indeterminate note: nevertheless	if fallout increased substantially or remained high for	a long time it would become far more important as a potential health	hazard in this country and throughout the world.	6.440731322323222
5980. dr linus	pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous	whether you choose to agree with him or not.	9.940523065603456
5981. after declaring in	an article last month in frontier magazine that the russian testing	carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences	of any action in the history of the world he gave this estimate	of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled	200 megatons:   the damage to human germ plasm would be	such that in the next few generations 160000 children around the world	would be born with gross physical or mental defects.	6.870288075395019
5982. long-lived carbon-14	from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal	or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations	and between 200000 and one million human beings now living would have	their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia.	6.070687261427489
5983. most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout	is concentrating.	12.24176333362696
5984. pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from	the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be	too high but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.	7.655267721221924
5985. the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due	in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from	which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn.	6.581438178312407
5986. but more than one conscientious	researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion	of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout	has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem.	9.734240924240982
5987. its	dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe	national security requires further testing.	6.505015825470207
5988. an illustration of this	attitude is found in john a mccone's letter to dr thomas	lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new	republic.	8.849644212283117
5989. to this day the atomic energy commission shies	away from discussing the health aspects of fallout.	11.918061550204342
5990. a recent study	on radiation exposure by the aec's division of biology and	medicine stated: the question of the biological effect h of radiation	doses is not considered herein.	6.932147063062232
5991. of course the aec	is in a bind now.	11.300804984208265
5992. if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers	of fallout it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests.	13.239242782422094
5993. so the commission's announcements of the new soviet shots have	been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually	left vague.	7.068464653461596
5994. now of course that the russians are the	nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s	when the us was testing in the atmosphere.	10.635306400244012
5995. the prevailing	official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good	for you might not be much worse than a bad cold.	8.19230649087781
5996. after a nuclear blast	one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had	to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof.	8.103812877077505
5997. things	aren't that simple anymore.	5.565193746240991
5998. yet if washington gets too indignant	about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork	if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.	11.366762526869808
5999. as of october 25 the aec	had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series 12 of them in a megaton	range including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons	; and	president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported.	8.06325665381254
6000. assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot	estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons a conservative computation	is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60	megatons.	8.122981515147627
6001. some government scientists say privately that the figure	probably is closer to 80 megatons and that the full 50-megaton bomb	that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.	5.9915828318806374
6002. if the new	soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian	tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a	fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far.	9.486410587866711
6003. to this must be added the	90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the	atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that	began in november 1958.	5.736927800038498
6004. one of the inescapable realities	of the cold war is that is has thrust upon the west a wholly new	and historically unique set of moral dilemmas.	12.042844243031213
6005. the first dilemma was	the morality of nuclear warfare itself.	9.422898184778953
6006. that dilemma is as much with	us as ever.	12.244032381940443
6007. the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear	testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present	series of soviet tests.	7.3502901885423
6008. when this second dilemma first	became	obvious- during the mid to late '50's- the united states	appeared to have three choices.	7.439588250265343
6009. it could have unilaterally abandoned	further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.	11.000845343906423
6010. it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds	that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist	world domination.	14.19797980856194
6011. or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation-	some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security.	6.07328908618276
6012. this	third choice was in fact made.	12.332299470240018
6013. with the resumption of soviet	testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks however the	hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken.	6.648909518245753
6014. once	again the united states must choose.	15.416591456442
6015. and once again the	choices	are much the same.	10.358275879786941
6016. only this time around the conditions are different	and the choice is far harder.	12.300444726177764
6017. the first choice abandoning tests	entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely	be exploited by the russians.	7.136746890140225
6018. the second choice full testing has	become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have	already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere.	8.682164524099955
6019. the third choice negotiation	presupposes as russian behavior demonstrates a great deal	of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.	7.992484669987875
6020. we take the	position however that the third choice still remains the only sane	one open to us.	11.908984256257654
6021. it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice	and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.	11.063829764773642
6022. its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice; one which should	it fail will not have contaminated the conscience.	11.042172222425739
6023. that is the	contamination we most fear.	11.681813291432636
6024. leaving aside the choice of unilateral	cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question	must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part	would not be a good choice.	8.884336455520188
6025. for that is the one an increasingly large	number of prominent americans are now proposing.	10.474849233932447
6026. in particular governor	nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as	anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.	11.052181870712243
6027. speaking	recently in miami governor rockefeller said that to assure	the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet	tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests.	7.405810086336284
6028. taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be	unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the united	states is to do confidently and firmly not what is popular	but what is right.	12.838068065579517
6029. what was missing in the governor's	argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would	enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable	to what is right.	6.275729774487293
6030. the possibility as he asserted that the russians	may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests	does not supply the needed ethical premise- unless of course we have	unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken	as a moral demand.	7.7909250142183355
6031. besides the lack of an adequate ethical	dimension to the governor's case one can ask seriously whether our	lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons	is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary.	5.930920185772741
6032. recent statements	by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the	contrary assured us that our lead is very great.	8.86924438618322
6033. unless the administration	and the defense department have been deceiving us the facts	do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric	testing.	7.385546966139008
6034. it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption	of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary	and even justifiable.	12.70265612417947
6035. but a resumption does not seem justifiable now.	12.840652142136388
6036. what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination	of the atmosphere by the soviet tests has radically increased our	own moral obligations.	11.734743807059477
6037. we now have to think not only of our national	security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests	we might undertake.	9.355655939154014
6038. this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded	or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even	of the evil of communism.	9.609637487737933
6039. too often in the past russian	tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part.	10.167240093702416
6040. there ought	to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless	of what russia does.	11.445071503762657
6041. the refusal to resume atmospheric testing	would be a good start.	8.40415128637942
6042. when his holiness	pope john 23 first called for an ecumenical council and at the	same time voiced his yearning for christian unity the enthusiasm	among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate.	9.323084768645217
6043. with good	reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom.	7.97347307713283
6044. but	as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became	known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides.	10.970113710185029
6045. the council we now know will concern itself directly only with	the internal affairs of the church.	7.215759338111703
6046. as it has turned out however	the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of	hope in the second were both wrong responses.	11.656366908803673
6047. two things have happened	in recent months to bring the council into perspective: each provides	a basis for renewed hope and joy.	6.2919477470032925
6048. first of all it is now	known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church	as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity.	9.369190903386585
6049. far from	being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believes that a	revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism	in the best possible light.	7.4782791069057835
6050. equally significant pope john	has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian	disunity.	8.67852312983148
6051. a major aim of the council will be to remove as	far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity.	10.379421702197513
6052. secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the	pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very	much alive and growing within the church.	8.831983628974312
6053. the establishment by the	holy father of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in	1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern.	7.3395120657502995
6054. the designation of	five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches	assembly in new delhi as official observers reverses the church's	earlier stand.	8.42558556053379
6055. the public appeal by the new vatican secretary	of state cardinal cicognani for renewed efforts toward eastern	and western reunion was still another remarkable act.	6.304263019782102
6056. nor can one	forget pope john's unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury.	8.928698676234175
6057. augustin cardinal bea the director of the secretariate	for christian unity has expressed as directly as anyone the	new spirit that pervades the church's stance toward the protestant	and orthodox churches.	5.121037295934222
6058. noting all the difficulties that stand in	the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.	11.694228215753448
6059. for discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts would	show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without	thinking of the omnipotence of god the irresistible efficacy of	prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit.	7.524570594543586
6060. can any christian fail to respond to these words?	12.730503131488412
6061. 	the administration's official budget review which estimates	a 6.	5.617121879557916
6062. 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isn't	making anyone happy.	8.947434772229398
6063. certainly it isn't making the president happy	and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget	got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever	he can and how he hopes to do better next year.	6.088563471118444
6064. we sympathize	with mr kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review	doesn't please us either although for very different reasons.	8.79861655871995
6065. furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying	than reassuring.	7.581464362766316
6066. in the first place a large part of the	discrepancy between president eisenhower's estimate of a 1.	14.374642731426324
6067. 5 billion	dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost	seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president's	farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor.	7.267072242993225
6068. the eisenhower	budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and	yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.	8.584220800947056
6069. the	rest of the deficit is also easily understood.	8.870528742298852
6070. four billion dollars	of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated	by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration quite	apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere.	7.128064787212781
6071. four hundred	million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a	responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower.	7.456841882113699
6072. the farm program	will cost an additional 1.	12.66738387692102
6073. 5 billion because of unusual weather	factors the food for peace program and other new measures.	8.537359238884779
6074. anti-recession	programs- aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed	areas- account for only 900 million of the 6.	7.1862697494557795
6075. our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy	programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard	to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.	6.081540942436151
6076. and yet mr kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents	of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and	economizing.	10.015828792755297
6077. we wish the president would remember that fiscal	responsibility was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.	7.979615040949563
6078. the party that won used to say something about a new frontier.	14.544344344645301
6079. introduction of the dialogue principle	proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting	of the catholic association for international peace in washington	the last weekend in october.	5.2467399820336835
6080. two of the principal addresses were delivered	by prominent protestants and when the speaker was a catholic	one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious	persuasion.	10.345470821609675
6081. several effects were immediately evident.	8.583809596837785
6082. sessions	devoted to ethics and foreign policy trends moral principle	and political judgment christian ethics in the cold	war and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this	procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves.	7.7869641008565536
6083. usually	questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker	or discussion leader.	5.203760552161821
6084. in the earlier sessions there was plentiful	discussion on the natural law which dr william v o'brien	of georgetown university advanced as the basis for widely acceptable	ethical judgments on foreign policy.	9.455306301671802
6085. that aristotelean-thomistic	principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the	participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself.	7.2190314866886816
6086. speakers	declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps	by some other name.	10.022005569671117
6087. a lebanese moslem told about its existence and	application in the islamic tradition as the divine law while a	caip member who has been working in close association	with delegates of the new un nations told of its widespread recognition	on the african continent.	6.160845264690698
6088. the impression was unmistakable	that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning	generality with a certain objective existence.	10.100712974125157
6089. another question	that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself.	9.799929844203236
6090. the stimulus from	the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences	was undeniable.	9.064697629087028
6091. it was expected that the comparison of different	approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's	positions and better comprehension of one's own.	6.392041814924218
6092. but a realization	that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed	and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions	to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political	issues.	8.69916573312817
6093. one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these	discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity	of being armed with the facts: knowledge of the destructive	force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing	on judgments as to the advisability of its use- to defend berlin	for example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political	judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account; it	is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian	imperative.	5.0881583386687055
6094. everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question.	12.29116938110899
6095. i was searching	for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy.	7.130102599732126
6096. i never	found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted	they were almost all members of the official family who presumably	harbor official thoughts.	10.699213448251012
6097. but i questioned also professional soldiers	who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy	irredentism.	7.218115146477574
6098. their answer was: it can be done and we will do it.	13.451674099915024
6099. and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang	kai-shek: in america i said practically no one	believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland.	6.034169775784154
6100. what	evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government	proposes to do just that and that it can be done?	11.619163393585177
6101.    he smiled.	17.31567151801298
6102. also at a british bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine	questions.	10.643807794350245
6103. i recalled sympathetically the duke's complaint in browning's	he smiled and said a word	or two to the interpreter who turned to me the president wonders	where you are going after you leave taipei?	6.172685820717982
6104.  that i smarted	is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.	10.824539611781796
6105. i answered the routine	question about my itinerary rather coolly.	8.026986857048339
6106. chiang spoke again	this	time at greater length.	9.599148601115228
6107. the president says the translator	came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because	he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia and	that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question.	7.9812958724831535
6108. he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound	determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return	is feasible he would merely sound redundant.	13.368216897596831
6109. so you yourself must	seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions.	9.01290170880762
6110. any information	we have here in taiwan is at your disposal.	10.364641523302963
6111. what are the relevant data?	13.728104054353006
6112.  for every person on taiwan there	are sixty in mainland china.	11.319251098149206
6113. if the raw population figures are	crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as	to suppose that poland might liberate russia.	8.124728345254981
6114. relative military manpower?	11.662650350608057
6115. 	less than 60-1 but at least 6-1.	6.187767405160895
6116. the estimates vary widely	on the strength of the chinese army.	12.04249408664953
6117. the armed	forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450000 though	a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.	6.41823631831083
6118. skill?	16.542242831953253
6119.  training?	12.348350321510317
6120. 	morale?	16.542242831953253
6121.  it is generally conceded that the formosan air force	is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained.	9.825098625427618
6122. the morale	is very high.	13.753993321527892
6123. even so it adds up to impossible odds except	that the question arises on whose side would the mainland chinese	army fight?	7.62396404333404
6124.    the miserable people of china the largest cast	ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves	resist overtly.	8.629658467684653
6125. they think perforce of physical survival:	everything else is secondary.	6.980913852152039
6126. but the army which mao continues to feed	well where are its sympathies?	11.530839451120226
6127.  the psychological strategists in	taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in china over	thousands of years.	6.840022586047245
6128. it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist	depersonalization.	18.44644755015393
6129. every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives	who are close to starvation.	7.606464730698652
6130. the soldiers themselves cannot stage	a successful rebellion it is assumed: but will their discontent	spread to the officer class?	7.763012138907529
6131.  the immediate families of the generals	and the admirals are well fed: a despot does not economize on his	generals.	5.698882456228031
6132. but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews.	19.001699309082998
6133. their privations	are almost beyond endurance.	7.978400293699054
6134. in behalf of what?	19.90914216290616
6135.  leninism-marxism	as understood by exegete mao.	5.203900375194826
6136. to whom will the generals stay	loyal?	13.699227468830154
6137.  there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they	would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out	on the farm.	10.842907624858103
6138. it is another question whether they- or a single	general off in a corner of china secure for a few	days at least from instant retaliation- will defy the party.	9.472096944654988
6139. but	the disposition to rebel is most definitely there.	7.3387408115203705
6140. but there	must be a catalytic pressure.	13.742022910486876
6141. the military in taiwan believe that	the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal.	7.064462749660998
6142. the first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural	poverty for years.	11.52648797115499
6143. the family is largely broken up; and where it	is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is	enormous.	7.45603362504161
6144. for it is the family that in china has always provided social	security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out members of	the clan.	10.469202664419244
6145. now the government must do that; but the government is	left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained.	6.030884209114545
6146. thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of	social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and	created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems	of social security.	7.540004690317583
6147. the second mistake is tibet.	11.12955218717578
6148. tibet has	historically served china as a buffer state.	10.107401716856153
6149. a friendly state sometimes	only semi-independent but never hostile.	5.82362269707525
6150. china never tried to	integrate tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions.	5.757837036806856
6151. red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed.	15.331716234962402
6152. tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult.	10.074525433927548
6153. tibet may bleed	china as algeria is bleeding france.	6.807577874844351
6154. these continuing	pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china	in a heightening state of tension.	9.46789653580177
6155. the imposition of yet another pressure	a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap.	9.094657164257683
6156. the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men.	11.687174869636065
6157. they know that	they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control.	8.072853529129164
6158. first	and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime.	12.389140956646363
6159. on these they feel they can rely.	11.871207959820223
6160. secondly they depend on america's	moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives.	8.445908982097615
6161. they	hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest we will	receive the opportunity gladly.	6.281234865314637
6162. i remarked jocularly to the president	that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite	a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd	day.	8.738084836093392
6163. he affected not to understand my point.	10.294058895027225
6164. but he-	and all of china- wear the scars of american indecisiveness and	he knows what an uncertain ally we are.	6.712984430409476
6165. we have been grand to formosa	itself- lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support	for the offshore islands.	9.394563552565712
6166. but our outlook has been and continues to	be defensive.	12.74105171161398
6167. a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr	kennedy's views on the world struggle.	9.049750836786009
6168. the free chinese know that	the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike.	10.057833329677877
6169. there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized	force for liberation.	10.750460279169541
6170. the moment of truth is the moment of crisis.	20.234496702242815
6171. during the slow buildup	the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details	fine words strutting gestures.	8.104778566551698
6172. the crisis burns these suddenly	away.	14.720364105539716
6173. there the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look.	14.055633311007096
6174. new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked	bones.	7.54048076944866
6175. a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for	a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure	verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies.	6.509664868097185
6176. before memory	too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen.	11.184310120838473
6177. the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of	public men at many levels.	7.671497748575036
6178. one knows better now who has bone and	who	has jelly in his spine.	10.389074222033415
6179. but i am here concerned more with policy	than with men.	10.294639409767104
6180. public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.	10.144730796933368
6181. now everyone knows- or knew in the week of december 10-	that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy.	5.432378901684816
6182. the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful	orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most	pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations-	the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship	between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved.	7.740724619858204
6183. of course the	fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations.	13.397857784656
6184. but	in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was	in reality the principal.	13.00279716363791
6185. the moment simultaneously revealed that	in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato	allies to the entire western community.	7.450060417260054
6186. by our policy the west was-	is- split.	10.967412778948525
6187. but the key revelation is not new.	11.894342891669247
6188. the controlling	pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november	1956.	8.784381578307986
6189. it reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis	exposes the reality: in cuba last spring	; at the peaks of the nuclear	test and the berlin cycles; in relation to laos algeria south	africa; right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally	linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana.	4.780025007324293
6190. reveal	this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:	under prevailing policy the u s can take the initiative	against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left.	9.925240163361018
6191. it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form	of regime what particular issue.	11.508769288535381
6192. the u s cannot take the	initiative against the left.	16.1897079784411
6193. there is even some question whether	the u s can any longer defend itself against an initiative	by the left.	9.966425855027055
6194. we can attack tshombe but not gigenza.	15.350906095145497
6195. no	matter that gizenga is moscow's man in the congo.	5.886940308784976
6196. no matter that	it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men.	10.801276069881355
6197. no matter	that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western	interests in africa.	7.2257201240519
6198. unified you don't protect western security by first removing	we can force	britain and france out of the suez but we cannot so much as try	to force the russian tanks back from budapest.	7.044147326706211
6199. we can mass our	fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros.	8.788599366063982
6200. we can	vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule	in angola but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall-	much less give the simple order to push the wall down.	8.111534609844618
6201. we officially	receive the anti-french moscow-allied algerian	fln	but we denounce the pro-europe anti-communist oas as criminal.	3.885619417759679
6202. in the very week of our war against katanga we make a $133	million grant to kwame nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity	with the communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into	a totalitarian dictatorship.	8.695805264291112
6203. as our planes land the war materiel that	kills pro-western katangans we stand supinely bleating while nehru's	troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato	ally portugal.	4.198396853394352
6204. what explains this uni-directional paralysis?	11.704525081711655
6205. 	it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes	the frame of our international- and in some degree our domestic-	policy.	7.214578033848978
6206. the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not	invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and	more active.	8.345756911308015
6207. most immediately relevant to these	episodes in goa katanga and ghana as to the suez-hungary crisis	before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama	is the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america.	6.926958626234088
6208. from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy	on the uncommitted nations	especially on those whose leaders make the most noise- nehru tito	nkrumah sukarno betancourt etc.	7.567871957578677
6209. our chief aim becomes that	of finding favor in neutralist eyes.	6.549758912909934
6210. if we grasp this orientation	as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned	becomes intelligible.	12.635833844402267
6211. and it becomes clear why in general we cannot	take the initiative against the left.	10.05288056589231
6212. to write a play the dramatist once	needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the	craft to develop it.	10.284752219640758
6213. nowadays more and more all he needs is someone	else's book.	6.951654168876459
6214. to get started he does not scan the world about him;	he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists.	9.189806394289104
6215. so	far this season broadway's premieres have included twice as many	best from	abroad.	5.383663763703375
6216. which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel a death	in the family; the wall awkwardly based on the john hersey	novel; advise and consent lively but shallow theater drawn	from the mountainously detailed bestseller; face of a hero	based on a pierre boulle novel.	5.993863915314918
6217. the only original works	attempting	to reach any stature: tennessee williams' disappointing domestic	comedy period of adjustment and arthur laurents' clever	but empty invitation to a march.	4.385366984470363
6218. clearly the most provocative	plays are all imported originals- a taste of honey by britain's	young shelagh delaney; becket	by france's jean anouilh; the hostage by ireland's	brendan behan.	4.231011932605432
6219. among the musicals camelot came	from t h white's the once and future king and novels	were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do	re mi.	6.389992169606971
6220. wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals	but pretty bad leaving top honors again to an import- the	jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce.	6.146453023367201
6221. the only other works	at least technically original were dreary farces- send me no	flowers under the yum-yum tree critic's choice.	4.686622308465793
6222. in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival	broadway is not even adapting books but reconverting old movies	.	9.843800618731933
6223. originals	are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily	bad.	6.667503870543579
6224. some memorable plays have been drawn from books notably life	with father and diary of anne frank.	8.509200245975858
6225. and particularly in the	musical field adaptations have long been the rule from die fledermaus	and the merry widow to oklahoma! and my fair	lady.	5.995373032925195
6226. as critic walter kerr points out: adaptations	so long as they are good still qualify as creative.	9.011302662658641
6227. and other defenders	invariably argue that after all shakespeare and moliere were	adapters too.	8.487138990928678
6228. the difference is that the masters took the bare frame	of a plot and filled it with their own world; most modern adapters	totally accept the world of a book squeeze it dry of life and add only	one contribution of their own: stage technique.	8.473427937983052
6229. the most	frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports	is increasing production expense- producers cannot afford to take chances.	5.815483608315345
6230. but that explanation is only partly true.	17.532681981872106
6231. off-broadway where	production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly	more original.	4.729533796369722
6232. laudably enough it is offering classics and off-beat	imports but last week only one us original was on the boards	robert d hock's stunning civil war work borak.	7.363627189773516
6233. the	real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of us playwrights.	9.0442478720918
6234. he: come	with me to the casbah.	8.646969493762523
6235. she: by subway or cab?	5.58909193927002
6236. 	that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan	as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and	eighth avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like	arabian nights grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american	inpost of belly dancing.	7.348593675463415
6237. several more will open soon.	10.027310289456599
6238. their	burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street	burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always	familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.	9.702875937152434
6239. the belly boites with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted	ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek	and turkish families.	4.610136736213832
6240. customers often bring their children; between	performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take	the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces.	7.5934637607724245
6241. except for the odd	uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor the people watch in	calm absorption.	7.446517022023376
6242. small shirt-sleeved	orchestras play in 24 or 44 time	using guitars violins and more alien instruments with names that	would open sesame: the oud grandfather of the lute; the darbuka	a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass; the def	a low-pitched tambourine.	4.898023931311182
6243. the girls sit quietly with the musicians wearing	prim dresses or plain secretarial shifts until it is time to	go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.	6.951876907369732
6244. if a dancer is good she suggests purely	and	superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny- the continuum	of mankind.	8.595608254688859
6245. but a great many of what variety calls the	cooch terpers are considerably less cosmic than that.	8.888852357512619
6246. each dancer	follows the ancient oriental pattern- she glides sideways with	shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing	and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips	and away to the far end of the room.	7.275687942654698
6247. this is done at varying speeds	ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli	meaning	to the fastest ecstatic karshilama	.	9.455983299130736
6248. the new york dancers are highly eclectic varying	the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends	or floor crawls.	10.117607956502109
6249. but they do not strip.	20.722604927600944
6250. the striptease is crass;	the belly dance leaves more to the imagination.	8.651734215846115
6251. when a dancer	does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills- although	the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping	the tips into the dancers' costumes.	5.128900467943985
6252. with tips the girls average	between $150 and $200 a week depending on basic salary.	6.6370810811834
6253. although	they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes	proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.	8.982696048116466
6254. all over the country belly clubs have never	been bigger especially in detroit boston and chicago and even	in small towns; one of the best dancers a turkish girl named semra	works at a roadhouse outside bristol conn.	8.244486079113656
6255. the girls are kept	booked and moving by several agents notably voluble black-bearded	murat somay a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central	abdomen.	5.919023522288919
6256. he can offer nine turkish girls plans to import at least	15 more.	11.454465339679285
6257. but a great many of the dancers are more or less native.	16.2167454259963
6258. sometimes	they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted	by lebanese and syrians in the us where they dance with	just as	few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.	7.673412452946295
6259. as the	girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting	pot has never bubbled more intriguingly.	6.719992265560028
6260. some manhattan examples:	jemela 23 seems hong kong oriental	but has a spanish father and an indian mother was born in america	and educated at	holy cross academy and textile high school says	she learned belly dancing at family picnics.	7.334333479022573
6261. serene	23 was born in budapest and raised in manhattan.	8.6163140506732
6262. daughter	of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance she is one of the few	really beautiful girls in the new york casbah with dark eyes and dark	waist-length hair the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe	glimmering body.	8.412082806589845
6263. many belly dancers are married but serene is one	of the few who will admit it.	8.296469410822523
6264. marlene	25 a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends	in paris now lives on manhattan's west side is about the best	belly dancer working the casbah loves it so much that she dances on	her day off.	7.1403866669494915
6265. she has the small highly developed body of a prime athlete	and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex.	6.7639438451180025
6266. leila 25 is a greenwich village painter of	persianesque miniatures	who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.	7.573725304816491
6267. a graduate of hollywood high school she likes to imagine herself	as she takes the floor a village girl coming in to a festival.	7.2521935038173435
6268. gloria circa 30 who was born	in italy and once did chorus work in toronto has been around	longer than most of the others wistfully remembers the old days	when	we used to get the seamen from the ships you know with big turtleneck	sweaters and handkerchiefs and all.	7.816379428093263
6269. but the ships are very slow	now and we don't get so many sailors any more.	5.3461274759709605
6270. the uptown crowd	has moved in and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck	sweater for a button-down collar?	7.836190522716664
6271. 	of the handful of painters that austria	has produced in the 20th century only one oskar kokoschka is widely	known in the us.	6.2478085890862065
6272. this state of unawareness may not last	much longer.	13.139945210537997
6273. for ten years a small group of european and us	critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian	expressionist	egon schiele who died 42 years ago at the age of 28.	7.631554926987843
6274. the	critics' campaign finally inspired the first major us exhibit	of schiele's works.	6.083131730935925
6275. the show has been to boston and manhattan	will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis.	8.665798719910857
6276. last week it opened	at the j b speed museum in louisville at the very moment	that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau	gallery in los angeles.	9.02073205618256
6277. schiele's paintings are anything	but pleasant.	5.200379248992876
6278. his people are angular and knobby-knuckled	sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.	7.230522601262992
6279. his colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes	seem swallowed in gloom.	6.205843153584731
6280. but he painted some of the boldest and	most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century	the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its	fascination.	10.701224221147337
6281. the son of a railway stationmaster	schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town	of tulln 14 miles northwest of vienna.	7.422246228258748
6282. he was an emotional lonely	boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely	any schoolwork.	11.727453215366996
6283. when he was 15 his parents finally allowed him to attend	classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna.	9.225672745997485
6284. even there he	did not last for long.	12.609910250411888
6285. cried one professor after a few months of student	schiele's tantrums and rebellion: the devil himself must	have defecated you into my classroom!   for a while his	work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists and by the patterned	mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt then the dean of austrian	art.	4.683391711430634
6286. gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own-	and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter.	6.977767677017335
6287. his pictures were	roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen	in vienna.	6.825525797964765
6288. he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and	jailed for 24 days- the first three of which he spent desperately trying	to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.	9.228961828623829
6289. for years he	wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars was even driven	to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna's gutters.	4.903575284249434
6290. drafted	into	the austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a vienna	billet went on painting.	7.650235687400574
6291. it was not until the last year of his	life that he had his first moneymaking show.	14.709273745743877
6292. the unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the	only	thing that kept the public at bay: his view of the world was one of	almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbid-minded	vienna.	9.693602251340502
6293. he was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of	old age and the tyranny of lust.	8.440966664077386
6294. the children he painted were almost	always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness	and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were stringy	contorted and strangely pathetic.	7.347993767631289
6295. the subject he liked most was the	female body which he painted in every state- naked half-dressed	muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a	bed or locked in an embrace.	4.954907067319377
6296. the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of	the soviet communist party is that it was surprising- perhaps	quite as much in its own way as the twentieth congress of 1956 which	ended with that famous secret report on stalin.	9.014010978449955
6297. the publication	last july of the party's draft program- that blueprint for	the transition to communism- had led the uninitiated to suppose	that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis	of the khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in	fact been current over the last three or four years	in all theoretical party	journals.	4.46162347135714
6298. these never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of marx	and lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment	of a communist society had now under khrushchev become	an immediate and tangible reality.	9.37665092188263
6299. it seems that khrushchev	himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution	to marxist doctrine with his draft program	his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was in fact very largely	.	6.123000819129293
6300. he and other soviet leaders	responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward	some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship	of the proletariat by an all people's state and also of having	laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of	the whole hierarchy of soviets starting with the supreme soviet itself.	8.039490137189043
6301. their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at	bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct	and active part in running the country.	6.8785736649605544
6302. also elections would be	more democratic; there might even be two or more candidates for voters	to choose from.	7.9630032973307605
6303. no doubt there was still a lot in the draft	program- and in khrushchev's speech- which left many points	obscure.	6.013094376403964
6304. was it the party's intention for example to abolish gradually	the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning	sovkhozes ie state farms	?	7.5836843779773995
6305.  as we know the soviet peasant today	still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on	his private plot; and it is still very far from certain how valid	the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes	the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private	plots to the	kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something	increasingly like a state farm.	6.400105149931518
6306. if one follows the reports of the	congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty	in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this	matter.	12.040697908194447
6307. the draft program was interesting in other respects	too.	9.453700013108643
6308. it contained for example a number of curious admissions about	the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no old-age pensions	no paid holidays; they still benefit far less than the other 50	per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet	union so greatly prides itself on being.	9.335173647456845
6309. over all these	fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;	and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures	of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the ordinary	people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism	is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food.	6.6989024479694725
6310. would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry?	11.336538768443306
6311.  this was something	on which k himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept	on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible	for agricultural production.	7.113590782262136
6312. and as we know the virgin lands are	not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped.	13.783182521330748
6313. one cannot	but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev's	agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the	big surprises provided by this congress- the obsessive harping on the	crimes and misdeeds of the anti-party group- molotov malenkov	kaganovich and others- including the eighty-year-old marshal	voroshilov.	5.129875758019162
6314. molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds	of sins- especially with wanting to cut down free public services	to increase rents and fares; in fact with having been against all	the more popular features of the khrushchev welfare state.	7.0634958338377025
6315. the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one	side of the story: what in the secret councils of the kremlin	molotov had really proposed we just don't know and he has had	no chance to reply.	5.718183767009746
6316. but one cannot escape the suspicion	that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated	anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not	inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on	vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the	transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy.	8.297589882955204
6317. the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful	competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this	congress.	8.22513619130284
6318. mikoyan declared:   molotov altogether rejects	the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the	state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and	to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war.	8.018602026779611
6319. his views in	fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence	who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed	peace.	7.529996275197011
6320. one cannot help wondering whether molotov	and the rest of the anti-party group are not being used as china's	whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers.	8.763437205237762
6321. for	something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese	relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated.	5.1268381322072445
6322. the effect of chou en-lai's clash with khrushchev together	with the everlasting attacks on molotov + co has shifted the whole	attention of the world including that of the soviet people from	the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese	conflict.	7.483586686882214
6323. not only as we know did chou en-lai publicly treat	khrushchev's attack on albania as something that we cannot consider	as a serious marxist-leninist approach to the problem	but	the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to	khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on.	5.674785353497009
6324. it is extremely	doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists	could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends.	11.530410126595852
6325. the big question is whether in the name of a restored chinese-soviet	solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians	to present their humble apologies to khrushchev- or get rid of	enver hoxa.	6.036977794334366
6326. these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy	incident can now be closed.	13.000369843323778
6327. but albania is merely a symptom	of a real malaise between china and russia.	7.621031120983275
6328. khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable	decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence	and would like above all the berlin and german problems	to be settled peacefully; he knows that he was never more popular than	at the time of the russo-american honeymoon of 1959.	7.952552245667941
6329. but	it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere- in the	first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby	which i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago exists on	the quiet inside the party.	5.851290911977589
6330. to these people solidarity and unity with	china should be the real basis of russia's future policy.	8.263173242483026
6331. and the	chinese as the albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that	khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the west.	6.457948765256219
6332. the fact that china	should be supported by north korea and north	vietnam is highly indicative.	14.433139053448986
6333. and one cannot but wonder whether	marshal malinovsky	who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but	also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against	the west wasn't trying to keep the chinese quiet.	5.904702432585662
6334. and this	brings us inevitably to the 30-	or 50-megaton bomb.	8.342976954246248
6335. was not this dropped	primarily in order to appease the chinese- especially after	khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the west in canceling	the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31?	4.943691699856225
6336.    what	does it all add up to?	12.175198509679205
6337.  indications are that khrushchev	favor peaceful coexistence and	the maintenance of the status quo in	the world.	7.015637413458197
6338. the chinese north vietnamese and north koreans on	the other hand feel that militarily russia is strong enough to support	them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark	on before long: with china attacking formosa and the north koreans	and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective	countries.	7.834114539672606
6339. perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult	position than any since 1957 when the anti-party group nearly	liquidated him.	6.331632350947845
6340. he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with	any internal opposition; but if he is up against china's crusading	spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing	choice in his life.	11.906460989931352
6341. he may support china; he	may break with china	or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions	in persuading china to be patient.	6.388699995340581
6342. the next days may show where things	stand.	13.519422842407764
6343. on a misty sunday morning last month a small band of militant	anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field	about fifteen miles east of here.	6.300799830098639
6344. eleven men a woman and a teen-age	boy tramped over cold damp fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour	field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.	6.403433083350122
6345. to the average	american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday	night tv movie.	7.300612930487606
6346. but to the minutemen this is a serious business.	18.855513113403944
6347. they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death	struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.	10.34438125746738
6348. they feel	that world war 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves	up as a last line of defense against the communist advance.	10.090417728507093
6349. their national leader robert bolivar depugh of norborne	mo says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best	suited to defeat the red onslaught.	5.73194255923169
6350. in their maneuvers last month	they wore world war 2 camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded	m-1 rifles.	9.587347504395344
6351. the maneuvers were held in secret	after a regional seminar for the minutemen held in nearby shiloh	ill had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had	arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville ill	and seized four operative weapons including a browning machine gun	two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle.	5.303470035219219
6352. undismayed	by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli's	home at 6:30 am the next day put on their uniforms	and headed for a farm several miles away.	7.616957221122672
6353. a 60 mm mortar and a	57 mm	recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along.	6.44369101760307
6354. the mortar	was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.	9.20115475318068
6355. after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war	2 army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing	squeezed between a long low ridge and a creek-filled gully.	6.437897759616711
6356. here	the two leaders depugh and lauchli hastened to put the group	through its paces.	8.858643188292232
6357. the minutemen were instructed in the use	of terrain for concealment.	9.180120001131415
6358. they were shown how to advance against an	enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge.	10.456322632158601
6359. they practiced movement behind a	smoke screen laid by smoke grenades; and they attempted a skirmish	line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment.	5.247051186679236
6360. eleven dummy	rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar	shooting.	8.411504832948724
6361. mrs depugh the mother of five children and an	active member of her husband's organization participated in all the	exercises.	6.679485795811632
6362. there were no casualties but the guerrillas	admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called	a halt at 9 am to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.	9.534938007327963
6363. i would like to add one more practical reform	to those mentioned by russell kirk dec 16.	9.433137610949741
6364. it has to do	with teachers' salaries and tenure.	14.947412568798356
6365. next september after receiving	a degree from yale's master of arts in teaching program	i will be teaching somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present	shortage of mathematics teachers.	5.00869049793402
6366. i will also be underpaid.	20.513372196527545
6367. the	amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers.	7.966847530937116
6368. teaching	is at present a sellers' market; as a result buyers the	public must be satisfied with second-rate teachers.	7.897893320603434
6369. but this is not	the real problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually	paid on the basis of time served rather than quality.	8.226074435470933
6370. hence all	teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of	years are paid the same salary.	9.883942833335691
6371. i am firmly convinced that considering	the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly	overpaid.	9.706009847775048
6372. it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect	any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how much the public	will pay for shoddy performance.	11.91729982710737
6373. the only hope which good teachers	have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight	of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them.	6.538185482868677
6374. the only hope which	the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis	of merit rather than tenure.	10.43099094218092
6375. here as in all sectors of the economy	quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual	to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.	9.016262032764626
6376. of initiative	on the eve of the great debate on the proposal	to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions	which could practically bring us into the atlantic community	we should face the alternatives on this proposition.	8.164225550407933
6377. what we will	be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective	which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which	we now operate.	7.247118282854145
6378. without this power we lay open any american industry	which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy	to the will of others.	9.377793862141402
6379. it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct	our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we	conduct our political affairs.	10.318991097001966
6380. i disagree with mr burnham's position on the common market	nov 18 as a desirable organization for us to join.	10.041490220022233
6381. for him to	ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of	this kind is difficult to understand.	7.948977307432485
6382. the pressure for our entry to	the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated	trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or	garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.	8.816883657734584
6383. the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing	to those who do not see its relation to political and legal	as well as economic self-rule.	9.202657988197668
6384. in entering this union we will be surrendering	most if not all of our economic autonomy to international	bodies such as the atlantic institute or the oecd	imf and others.	10.79048285696202
6385. to think that we can merely	relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political	or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.	8.336464067140547
6386. if it is not enough that	all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join	this market i refer you to an article in the new york times'	magazine section nov 12 1961 by mr eric johnston	entitled we must join the common market.	9.57151903472119
6387. he says: it	has swept aside petty nationalisms age-old rivalries and worn-out	customs.	4.041446619637108
6388. referring to britain he says we see a nation that	traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its	economy placing this authority in continental hands.	9.936092277087358
6389. h since	the goal of our international planners is a world government this atlantic	community would mark a giant step in that direction for once	american economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question	of time.	6.891534530622905
6390. frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense	they have us over a barrel.	10.317274278574448
6391. listen to what mr johnston has to	say: consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.	5.202627323616335
6392. h we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports	we need.	10.533575676634888
6393. we would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline	widespread unemployment.	9.241746916873636
6394. but the solution to this dilemma	is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community	or economic empire but merely what libertarians like henry	hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years: an	end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry	and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry.	8.013316616228307
6395. create a	free market here give us a sound debt-free money system and we'll	compete with anyone europe and asia combined.	4.623193713043698
6396. in short get this	governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about	european competition or communism either.	7.079541146970738
6397. if we want to preserve	our sovereignty this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international	planning board.	9.291713059151439
6398. if we go into this common market we might	just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees connally	amendments or for that matter conservatism in general.	10.598124956960634
6399. we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided	discussion of the atlantic common market which nr will	be continuing in our pages.	6.4414015056483205
6400. the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the	world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning november	27 anticipating by two days the announcement of the us	treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed.	8.663633341240205
6401. and the army	in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two	years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in	any further army reserve activities.	6.708094857167634
6402. now more than five years later	i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier.	10.248244644735903
6403. but	in spite of this i at present a man 31 years of age and a college	professor have been recalled by direction of the president	to report on november 25th to fort devens massachusetts for another	twelve months of active duty as an sp 4	.	6.801774576063951
6404. today seven years after the date of my initial induction	as a draftee i am assistant professor of philosophy and science	at st michael's college.	8.155147236699161
6405. for after leaving the army in 1956	i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college	and then at the university of toronto.	8.489877224219617
6406. this time added to that which	i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 makes	a total of twenty-two years of education.	8.297827226446723
6407. the possibility	of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american	has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys.	9.155831188846696
6408. with	this no loyal citizen can quarrel.	10.108134418436977
6409. however it seems axiomatic that	the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably	equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably	causes.	7.154119033795195
6410. in my own case i submit that such reasonable and fair	exercise is woefully lacking.	11.993302436242976
6411. taken back into the army now as an	sp 4 i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am.	6.869263354960493
6412. wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from	at this late date it is	impossible for st michael's college to find a suitable replacement	for me.	8.315370587954694
6413. even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal	life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very	compelling reason- i cannot help looking around at the black leather	jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns	of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone	mad.	6.2551348360157215
6414. in news broadcasts i consistently	hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army	referred to as mercenaries.	10.041778967463076
6415. this confuses me no end.	9.848600624355685
6416. if the hessian	troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for	england in the 1770's were mercenaries what shall we call the un	troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to	fight for the united nations?	7.3248703334524725
6417.  if the un troops are not mercenaries	then the hessians were not mercenaries either.	8.757953221985138
6418. and if the foreigners	fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette	and von steuben were mercenaries too as were also the members of the	lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 and of	chennault's flying tigers in the early days of world war 2.	11.9611550756016
6419. it doesn't take a gore vidal to tell you	what's wrong with cherokee textile's slogan pitney-bowes	objects july 1.	3.458278081111476
6420. it's an eighteenth-century negative man!	suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment:  by moving	the term republic to lower case substituting the modern	phrase move ahead for the stodgy keep and by using the postmaster's	name on every envelope	the slogan cannot fail.	3.690387891155196
6421. impending death of pope	in the issue of march 5 1960 you had an	excellent editorial which said:   on trial in jakarta for	having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents	us	pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting	the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence	of indonesia.	4.569070176077053
6422. facing a prosecution which has demanded the	death penalty he said: 'i have participated in the war against	communism in korea and at dienbienphu and i have helped in the evacuation	of north vietnamese to the free world.	7.633810004749781
6423. i have done all this	for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states	which have been threatened by communist domination'.	9.330205389842638
6424. at least in	indonesia khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with	communism!   since then nothing has happened to save the	life of pope.	10.010857585417687
6425. i found recently a very small article in the new	york times:   us	flier loses plea.	7.500654992801259
6426. indonesia court	upholds pope's death sentence.	8.294979379921486
6427. indonesia military supreme	court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence	pope an american pilot.	6.487023618231437
6428. pope was convicted last year of having aided	north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions.	8.8000524101224
6429. he has been in	prison since may 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas.	8.392132775618967
6430. he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency.	16.150354384364896
6431. as	we see pope may appeal to president sukarno khrushchev's friend	for clemency.	6.033274625130606
6432. this possibility is anything but reassuring.	14.429463976638107
6433. the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban	freedom fighters.	8.898984093453455
6434. but who will act now and immediately to save the	life of alan pope?	13.017792998184825
6435.  are tractors available for him?	11.352210605364833
6436.  does anybody	think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot?	10.542836349453617
6437. 	a few days before i saw your mention of what texas	liberals were doing to promote louis capet the week	june 3 another analogy had occurred to me.	5.800004172021541
6438. consider	this table:  louis 14- fdr.	6.328869383837817
6439. h with no strong	men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government.	7.776350891604079
6440. a 'dust-settling' period	of decadence and decline.	8.182163017636087
6441. h he opened his mouth said little and thought not at all.	8.53860153302792
6442. h not completely virtuous	but completely incompetent.	10.864701210959561
6443. and marie antoinette- jacqueline	bouvier.	9.500547087180845
6444. h the beautiful and light-hearted.	14.905800387285987
6445. french revolution- conservative revolution?	6.025742512261564
6446.    truly	that liberals should choose louis 14 as a bogey-symbol of conservatism	is grotesquely ironic considering the louis 14 character	of their grand monarque fdr: not only in his accretion of absolute	power and personal deification	but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.	6.181797624129567
6447. in defeating louis capet john tower's victory in	texas signals once again the end of the divine right of liberalism.	7.657673495236713
6448. it seems to me that nc in his editorial	confrontation sr mar 25 has hit upon the real	problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain	our personal relationship with those who suffer?	10.46780367055416
6449.  this affects us	all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.	8.647791708429923
6450. i know of no other solution than the one nc proposes-	to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that	this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place.	9.318246715370787
6451. never	have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically.	6.730831002015174
6452. thank you for the illustrated editorial confrontation.	18.59493510890808
6453. it is both great writing and profound religion.	13.340923542111502
6454. nc	has said something important so well that this preacher	will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece.	9.689746265063686
6455. i	feel that nc hit the very core of our existence in the editorial	confrontation.	6.8496476371947015
6456. personally it meant a great deal; my	only hope is that it will be shared by many many others.	12.392147714577181
6457. confrontation	should fortify us all whether in southeast	asia or the us.	6.781099363800691
6458. congratulations to nc	for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the	peace corps.	12.76954017460511
6459. i concur that it is necessary for americans to have	a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands.	10.224377378023153
6460. it would	be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted	by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into.	9.602150640462348
6461. the editorial confrontation was certainly direct	in its appear to those of us living here in america.	8.937930914810835
6462. i personally	gained strength from it.	14.998926656529509
6463. thanks for continuing to capture the attention	and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world.	8.03833738045158
6464. nc's editorial confrontation is a stunning piece	of writing.	7.182197626993486
6465. i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone	entering the peace corps to read it.	8.73167463582872
6466. the important people to	humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros h but the schweitzers	and the dooleys and the others like them whose names we will	never know.	9.531483235787773
6467. editor's note: reprints of confrontation	will be included among the material to be distributed to	members of the peace corps.	5.349970825064619
6468. a peace corps official described the	editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the	men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers.	9.859772144521962
6469. bostonian?	12.348350321510317
6470. 	f l lucas's article in sr's	april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the	new english bible.	7.048628439501427
6471. i certainly hope this will be the impression left	in the minds of readers rather than the comment by cleveland amory	in his first of the month column.	9.451532462252464
6472. it is blind fundamentalist	dogmatism to say messing around with the king james version	h seems to us a perilous sport at best.	13.45175318714703
6473. lester markel is on the right track in his article interpretation	of interpretation	sr mar 11.	10.157568013363631
6474. the current stereotype	of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting	the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored	fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished	in this country more than a generation ago.	7.6171996640937065
6475. we don't	need this type of protection any more.	7.640772607814966
6476. the public is now armed with	sophistication and numerous competing media.	11.748495531649393
6477. besides there are no	longer enough corruptible journalists about.	7.434929200072158
6478. the accepted method	of writing news has two major liabilities.	10.364277244469454
6479. first it does not communicate.	12.684467409573262
6480. a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements	of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell	his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute.	9.95861121899008
6481. second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous.	7.238020571952204
6482. the	charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed	innocent people but misled the nation.	8.211486460815083
6483. yet the press was powerless	to put these charges in perspective in its news columns.	8.031643729316563
6484. despite several	years of front-page stories the average citizen was unable to get	a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen	what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way	of communicating.	7.967354447476819
6485. the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.	8.916859501882938
6486. it seems to me the time has come for the american	press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will	do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by	those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve	their own ends.	10.996132751381635
6487. the objective should be to provide a method of getting	into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant	information in the possession of reporters and editors.	7.2797167631053625
6488. i would like to see you devote	some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president	kennedy's activities so far as southern california is concerned.	11.603532181746123
6489. you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised	press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent	opinions.	10.934759604525675
6490. to begin with the all-powerful los angeles times	does not publish a transcript of these press conferences.	8.99492267652378
6491. i	am sure that they did when eisenhower was president.	8.172993298964991
6492. next	because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks	during the middle of the day.	11.974370020177972
6493. up until now the networks have grudgingly	run half-hour tapes at 5 pm or sometimes 7 or 10:30 pm.	5.830529440594833
6494. even then a few of the less interesting questions are	edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator.	11.982745043746123
6495. however last night	the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got	on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley	and brinkley could squeeze into their programs.	6.834334945440551
6496. this is no criticism	of them as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute	news summary.	9.133233735949826
6497. the radio stations did run transcripts	during the evening hours.	8.584864378376396
6498. however by comparing	the tv snatches two different radio station re-runs and the censored	los angeles times version i found that the radio stations	had edited out questions	or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president's answer.	7.780532330122655
6499. i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country	about the abuse he is being subjected to.	9.808950038944667
6500. we out here don't	see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.	11.207906086610842
6501. i don't	know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently	it is not.	8.34276825266631
6502. it also happened with the inauguration which was	not re-run at all during the evening hours and i wrote to the tv	editor of the times.	11.111466193913353
6503. he did mention in his column the fact that	he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand	the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this-	but nothing happened.	5.879791398152316
6504. can you bring the networks' attention	to this?	10.724224113620268
6505. 	i was interested	in james webb young's madison avenue column in which	he raised the question do we need a college of propaganda?	6.086414817954563
6506. 	sr feb 11.	10.982563828180641
6507. in my estimation we definitely	do; and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into	excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die.	8.22635289294824
6508. during	the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare	which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the	various shades of grey in between.	10.12050258544614
6509. we had a couple of schools in this	country the principal one being on the marshall field estate out	in lloyd's neck.	7.857350198000066
6510. there were also a couple in canada and several	in england.	15.527868930018771
6511. the english schools preceded ours and by the time we	got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda	and its teaching.	9.58689070555513
6512. four of us here in the united states attended	first as students then as instructors almost every one of these	schools in england canada and the united states.	13.069244004098348
6513. we set up	the lloyd's neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there.	6.375325682771377
6514. toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something	about propaganda and how to teach it.	12.73453591193382
6515. when the end did	come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped	that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.	7.99247803225225
6516. we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some	sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year	or so.	9.074565840314335
6517. alas no such thing happened.	10.404728971972768
6518. there apparently is no school of	propaganda or psychological warfare.	13.370006187700211
6519. a study at the pentagon and at	the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there.	8.501316006662519
6520. and	not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been	called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way.	10.714645626492125
6521. congratulations	on the article do we need a college of propaganda?	9.586799457806928
6522. 	this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this	critical field in years and i certainly hope it sparks some action.	10.817848301781359
6523. many of us in public	relations were flattered that richard l tobin chose to devote his	editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger	of the public relations society of america and the american public	relations association.	7.670450670635284
6524. i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue	of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet	been published.	11.5084649736224
6525. whether in his forthcoming book c p snow	commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily	autobiographical critic charged him is important.	7.367347937419782
6526. one should be able	to get hold of the book at once.	12.532189488062969
6527. but the attack was made from an advance	copy.	12.357786288985663
6528. if this practice should take root and spread the man who	submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before	he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.	9.215909953352242
6529. editor's note: sir robert watson-watt	wrote on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961: i	have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled 'science	and government'.	4.023322376971297
6530. until the work actually appears i am	not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail.	10.638787093931711
6531. but i have compared	its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin	lectures at harvard from which the book was derived and i can	with confidence challenge the gist of c p snow's incautious	tale.	6.523528026713729
6532. watson-watt's remarks in sr did not then	constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures.	8.984826045516403
6533. representatives of harvard university press which is publishing	the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge	that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print	an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date.	5.570939282530538
6534. the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the	prepublication excerpt.	10.23732651364175
6535. sir robert watson-watt's rebuttal	of sir charles snow's godkin lectures is marred throughout	by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself	from sir charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods	in an unclear incoherent argument.	4.126951020283623
6536. the article	presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning.	10.831040201657196
6537. it calls the	conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike	a perverted conclusion.	7.4025093608852455
6538. it submits	an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing	another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir	charles' account.	10.504365805749476
6539. we are left to choose between the two lindemanns.	13.836949932800929
6540. the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the	result of the tea party.	10.865775336081718
6541. but we are to believe that lindemann actively	supported radar outside the tizard committee and dissembling	discounted it inside?	9.505693733366213
6542.  if so i would lean to sir charles' conception	of the man.	10.666281925794507
6543. i think it was a grave error to print the	article at this time.	10.92723165306809
6544. to the unfortunate people unable to attend the	godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the	book which may dissuade some people from reading it.	8.304599280630486
6545. it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the	violin.	11.841383236650746
6546. certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless	recitals and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with	the chicago symphony orchestra playing the brahms concerto with	his own slashing demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high pale	pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music	or forever finds it closed.	7.832909870279361
6547. there was about that song something	incandescent for this brahms was milstein at white heat.	10.118660435599802
6548. not	the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious	or even the most eloquent.	9.115359287259505
6549. those would be reserved for the orchestra's	great nights when the soloist can surpass himself.	6.3868499652688095
6550. this time the	orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own	high mood.	10.156327165604313
6551. but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only	up to a point.	9.975915027163966
6552. that is when mr milstein thrust straight	to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing	glittering and sometimes spitting mr hendl could go along.	10.043076744987026
6553. but	mr hendl does not go straight to any point.	7.578597509359547
6554. he flounders and	lets music sprawl.	13.464169111288356
6555. there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and	marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra	and music to ultimate fusion.	9.11722463071042
6556. so we had some dazzling and memorable	milstein but not great brahms.	11.089862468337211
6557. the concert opened with	another big romantic score schumann's overture to manfred	which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic	point to keep it afloat.	5.720149800404767
6558. hindemith's joust with weber tunes was	a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent	textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit.	6.134682107706467
6559. it got the kind of scrambled	coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when	the man with the baton lacks technique and style.	8.04135981865157
6560. summer	the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production	of tannhaeuser staged by wieland wagner who is doing all the	operas this time and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch.	7.495213042564443
6561. sawalisch	also conducts the flying dutch opening july 24.	6.229861841696659
6562. parsifal	follows july 25 with hans knappertsbusch conducting and he	also conducts die meistersinger to be presented aug 8 and	12.	7.209438767963177
6563. the ring cycles are july 26 27 28 and 30 and aug	21 22 23 and 25.	6.972158635517202
6564. no casts are listed but	lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano grace bumbry will	sing venus in tannhaeuser.	8.112143746603522
6565. remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago	missed seeing the bolshoi ballet?	8.031866425343713
6566.  remember how by lack of two big	theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet?	10.285492847322361
6567. 	well now we have two big theaters.	7.983159858304344
6568. but barring a miracle and	don't hold your breath for it chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov	ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and	is one of the great companies of the world.	8.666148487402143
6569. before you let	loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times	indeed we did.	6.606685354541419
6570. the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big	theater in mccormick place which sol hurok ballet booker extraordinary	considers the finest house of its kind in the country- and	of course he doesn't weep at the capacity either.	7.173161125963918
6571. allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates	as dec 4 thru 10.	6.896834204041869
6572. later the hurok office made it dec 8 thru	17 a nice long booking for the full repertory.	9.670006344836905
6573. but if you keep a calendar	of events as we do you noticed a conflict.	10.303265157330163
6574. allied arts had	booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec 8 and 9.	9.296967284566225
6575. not la dietrich.	12.603846294600546
6576. allied arts then notified	us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking fly here	to open nov 28 and close dec 2.	7.9793933593362265
6577. shorter booking but still	a booking.	7.451639798633041
6578. a couple of days later a balletomane	told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was	told the newspapers had made a mistake.	9.85009219859941
6579. so i started making	some calls of my own.	10.192223641836808
6580. the kirov ballet	is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium los angeles nov	21 thru dec 4.	9.017269309964917
6581. not a chance of opening here nov 28-	barring that miracle.	7.987341429520973
6582. then why not the juicy booking hurok had held	for us?	9.988578242416683
6583.  well dietrich won't budge from mccormick place.	5.247719039575448
6584. then	how about the civic opera house?	9.649824447112527
6585.  well allied arts has booked	lena horne there for a week starting dec 4.	8.002304034405206
6586. queried about	the impasse allied arts said: better cancel the kirov for	the time being.	5.981113344844293
6587. it's all up in the air again.	3.537123757280537
6588. so the kirov	will fly back to russia minus a chicago engagement a serious	loss for dance fans- and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of	one of the richest bookings in the country.	7.966015264887089
6589. will somebody please	reopen the auditorium?	9.383868673811618
6590. 	paintings and drawings by marie moore of st thomas virgin	islands are shown thru nov 5 at the meadows gallery 3211	ellis av week days 3 p m to 8 p m sundays 3 p m	to 6 p m closed mondays.	7.427514226464554
6591. an exhibition of	evelyn cibula's paintings will open with a reception nov 5 at	the evanston community center 828 davis st.	5.441900050342579
6592. it will continue all	month.	40.86002322329271
6593. abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear	are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame	until nov 5.	4.9044649947953145
6594. in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget the dallas	civic opera will use san francisco's new leni bauer-ecsy	production of lucia di lammermoor this season returning the favor	next season when san francisco uses the dallas don giovanni	designed by franco zeffirelli.	7.390708394812309
6595. h e bates has scribbled a farce called hark hark	the lark! it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible	novels of the season.	6.382296028531113
6596. if there is a moral lurking among the	shenanigans it is hard to find.	19.42327626349323
6597. perhaps the lesson we should take from	these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild	scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.	7.980208247030858
6598. anyway a number of	them meet here in devastating collisions.	9.887702609290756
6599. one is an imperial london	stockbroker called jerebohm.	10.818727375401922
6600. another is a wily countryman called larkin	whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled i believe	in earlier volumes of mr bates' comedie humaine.	6.720296678372956
6601. what's	up now?	8.222989080403314
6602.  well jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the	stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive	rustic simplicities.	8.736051413950223
6603. they want to own a junior-grade castle	or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might	once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded	courtiers.	5.815979732209091
6604. they are willing to settle however in anything	that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at.	10.426847343739526
6605. and of course	larkin has just the thing they want.	10.219946208757893
6606. the name of it is gore court and it is surrounded	by a wasteland that would impress t s eliot.	12.966177772535993
6607. that's not	precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it though.	5.584594968381167
6608. he conjures	herds	of deer and wild birds crowding the air.	10.462959167699635
6609. he suggests	that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor.	7.5424893358509655
6610. the stained-glass	windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling	may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform.	7.91920291403587
6611. the vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions	when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch.	6.507379183116359
6612. larkin has an answer to all that.	11.706274378142007
6613. the spaciousness of the tudor	cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra	television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids.	6.346265889667279
6614. also perhaps	table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented.	7.868918304443877
6615. it's a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble	larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse.	3.472799595155264
6616. he doesn't really need the immense sum of money	he makes them pay.	6.477618083019761
6617. for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot.	8.807217730881382
6618. he has	a glorious wife and many children.	12.934539391897465
6619. when he needs money to buy something	like say the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he	takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies.	6.918290720869896
6620. one of those capital-gains	ventures in fact has saddled him with gore court.	11.601316161290015
6621. he is	willing to sell it just to get it off his hands.	10.715659400859153
6622. and the jerebohms	are more than willing to buy it.	13.143762138909027
6623. they plan to become county people	who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth.	6.025543643921613
6624. one then the other	if in larkin's eyes they are nothing	but piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they	have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.	9.004620627721504
6625. mr bates	shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc.	6.697772484298131
6626. oneupmanship	is practiced by both sides in a total war.	11.198103976929243
6627. first	the larkins are ahead then the jerebohms.	7.640287248877652
6628. after larkin has been persuaded	to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what	he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers.	9.070338052998563
6629. one	of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling's	tales of india does not approve of the way larkin gets	his birds.	6.718663893542834
6630. he doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair	on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance	is entirely sporting.	8.481624939162671
6631. but the brigadier dines on the birds with	relish.	10.452783070756984
6632. it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive	film yet made from miguel de cervantes' don quixote	is the brilliant russian spectacle done in wide screen and color	which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street	playhouses.	7.333106391112277
6633. more than a beautiful visualization of the	illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant	and his squire sancho panza in seventeenth-century spain this inevitably	abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an	affectingly warm and human exposition of character.	4.764140450266671
6634. nikolai	cherkasov the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander	nevsky and ivan the terrible performs the lanky don quixote	and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility	and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.	7.135948442317485
6635. his addle-brained	knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an	age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous	code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as cervantes no doubt	intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely	in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues.	4.937572052910502
6636. cherkasov	does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do.	8.739555662959031
6637. he	treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection	and respect.	4.511815625177236
6638. directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is	studiously	slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and	passing gravely through an impious world.	8.220077224759082
6639. the complexities	of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately	stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in	place of the russian dialogue.	6.831109519694398
6640. the voices of all the characters including	that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform	with the personalities.	9.476535481139534
6641. and the subtleties of the dialogue are most	helpfully conveyed.	12.701602938328179
6642. since russian was being spoken instead of spanish	there is no violation of artistry or logic here.	8.81427059236355
6643. splendid	too is the performance of yuri tolubeyev one of russia's leading	comedians as sancho panza the fat grotesque squire.	4.999058556279022
6644. though	his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don	he gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant dignity-	too.	7.247436602366188
6645. it is really as though the russians have seen in this character	the	oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons.	9.536952645517315
6646. the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played	on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is	one of the best in the film.	10.93034414600421
6647. true the pattern and flow of	the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in	the first half before don quixote goes to the duke's court.	7.001975513508862
6648. but	strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed	episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of	the old boy.	7.37961621490959
6649. there are other good representations of peasants	and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently	photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this	country in the program of joint cultural exchange.	8.13662719866557
6650. also on the	bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called	sunday in greenwich village a tour of the haunts and joints.	6.959827914106129
6651. television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz	which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member	of the family.	7.484894118312948
6652. there seems to be an unfortunate assumption	that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example	could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary.	9.622570853969144
6653. at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for chicago	and all that jazz presented on nbc-tv nov	26.	8.740470463771072
6654. the program came out of the nbc special projects department	and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series.	12.999963088477442
6655. perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines.	7.731447230502591
6656. if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different	department- one with enough confidence in the musical material	to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room	to display their talents.	10.345617052274427
6657. as a matter of fact this latter approach	has already been tried and with pleasing results.	10.5644229247941
6658. a few years	ago a	timex all-star jazz show offered a broad range of styles	ranging from lionel hampton's big band to the free-wheeling	dukes of dixieland.	6.520190130029733
6659. an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live	character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician	and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.	6.9318619354176025
6660. about that same time john crosby's tv series	on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space	is one of the most sensible things a producer can do.	7.670180131119427
6661. in an hour remembered	for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries	went before the cameras for lengthy periods.	8.056902310858126
6662. the program had been arranged	to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration	on the music.	12.399909713179326
6663. cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups	then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work.	4.944238349000967
6664. chicago and all that jazz could not be faulted on the choice	of artists.	11.954503886051452
6665. some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden	gene krupa bud freeman pee wee russell johnny st cyr	joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley.	5.411882523381593
6666. the	jazz buff could hardly ask for more.	9.848788210090584
6667. furthermore garry moore	makes an ideal master of ceremonies.	6.954000583934588
6668. one of the script's big problems	was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances	by musicians of today.	11.161766711358199
6669. nbc had gathered a lot of historical material	which it was eager to share.	8.128565251256843
6670. for example there was sheet music	with the word jazz in the title	to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold.	10.360584009277796
6671. samples	soomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles	passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood	of the late teens and 1920's.	5.297707739253602
6672. however well chosen and cleverly	arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an	interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business which	should probably have been the gathering	of fresh samples of the chicago style.	7.397860379001537
6673. another source of	nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this	view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would	have blotted out the entire glimpse.	5.4959777761280835
6674. similarly in presenting still	photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a	close perusal.	9.538831892004357
6675. chicago and all that jazz may have wound	up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.	7.050637370930323
6676. by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase	for today's artists the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect	example of either.	8.138951205290285
6677. still the network's willingness to experiment	in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily	anticipated.	6.088869002531375
6678. even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous	reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending	her debut as lucia in donizetti's lucia di lammermoor sunday	night.	7.748943690387476
6679. the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of	cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland	took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic mad	scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the	other performers.	6.91693415123659
6680. her entrance in scene 2 act 1 brought some	disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note.	8.549398399043001
6681. thereafter	the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved	judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship	some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization.	4.384702751087892
6682. as she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness	emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost	unprecedented in years of performances of lucia.	9.027236937083515
6683. she topped	the sextet brilliantly.	10.305736566839592
6684. each high note had the crowd in ecstasy	so that it stopped the show midway in the mad scene but the	real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding	at the moment.	8.925026908427492
6685. miss sutherland appeared almost as another person	in this scene: a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura	who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her	role.	5.055831960451917
6686. what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as	miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among	sopranos today.	7.832652647299399
6687. this big flexible voice with uncommon range	has been superbly disciplined.	6.886259285543116
6688. nervousness at the start must have caused	the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly.	9.142713614215161
6689. in	the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous	scene magnificently.	6.290067391775256
6690. technically it was fascinating aurally	spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic.	7.0836914049474
6691. many years have passed	since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable.	8.558061399737399
6692. her debut	over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine.	9.334481660779275
6693. the	performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor	silvio varviso.	6.086595633164207
6694. he injected more vitality into the score than	it has revealed in many years.	10.381217580593637
6695. he may respect too much the italian tradition	of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them	in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.	6.052523679148104
6696. richard tucker	sang edgardo in glorious voice.	9.724366541034502
6697. his bel canto style gave the performance	a special distinction.	6.817794148094201
6698. the remainder of the cast fulfilled its	assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and	limited stage direction proved only serviceable.	11.859001038289174
6699. miss sutherland	first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959.	7.2552186554587825
6700. she	has since turned to bellini whose opera beatrice di tenda	in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her	to new york last season.	7.520827066316086
6701. she will sing la sonambula with	it here next week.	8.596398013990022
6702. anyone for musical ping-pong?	12.952854407424512
6703.    it's really quite fun-	as long as you like games.	2.4377496165138517
6704. you will need a stereo music system	with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and	one or more of the new london phase 4 records.	12.486606647430818
6705. there are 12	of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the	star release.	10.696477654591504
6706. this features	the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various	national bands were marching by your reviewing stand.	8.444999267927924
6707. complete with	crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of	realism this disc displays london's new technique to the best effect.	4.769673982443944
6708. all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed	explanation of this new recording program.	12.283360863900594
6709. no reference is made to the	possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and	it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music.	7.731076595942169
6710. directionality	is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the sounds of	the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension	to the music.	7.882934721627642
6711. you definitely hear some of the instruments close	up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently	more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely	being louder than the ones farther back.	7.437130212392525
6712. this is a characteristic of	good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural	sound.	14.139402297132984
6713. london explains that the very distinct directional	effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods	of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape	channels.	6.887962293753363
6714. these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active	co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two	channels which are impressed on the record.	7.596086912931094
6715. in some of the numbers	the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and	then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.	7.886956803700252
6716. some clue to the character of london's approach in these discs	may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include	the word percussion or percussive.	8.92342652599588
6717. drums xylophones	castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably	well.	6.276817248601984
6718. only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting	in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your	left and others facing them on the wall to your right.	12.452313967711374
6719. they are definitely	in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as	though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a	spirited volley.	7.393794372120734
6720. stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and johnny	keating's kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive	moods	seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements just	didn't have so much character as the others.	5.7137363896694024
6721. there is an extraordinary	sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained	at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies.	10.285226565345623
6722. the penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant	but brassy piano sounds in	.	10.338318656652461
6723. all of the releases however are recorded at a	gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise.	7.959995907874895
6724. practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic	demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system.	9.772340405669166
6725. many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not	realistic.	7.439054270581664
6726. strange but true- authenticity and realism often	aren't related at all.	5.746634568144488
6727. almost every film bearing the imprimatur	of hollywood is physically authentic- in fact impeccably so.	5.575278907038974
6728. in	any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor	bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.	6.6078473423192285
6729. the major studios	maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who	look to this matter.	6.689405333392635
6730. during the making recently of an important biblical	film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only	of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports	arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and	complied with.	8.104155300251344
6731. but alas the authenticity seems to stop at	the set's edge.	7.691171249257409
6732. the drama itself- and this seems to be lavishly true	of biblical drama- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity	at all.	7.698254813340811
6733. the storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic.	8.787046937007625
6734. thus in the story of ruth we have ruth naomi and boaz	and sets that are meticulously authentic.	10.524666875560438
6735. but except for a vague adherence	to the basic storyline- ie that ruth remained with naomi	and finally wound up with boaz- the film version has little to	do with the bible.	5.464367796938366
6736. and in the new king of kings the	plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to	the gospels.	10.67301935258174
6737. earlier this month edward r murrow director	of the united states information agency came to hollywood and	had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.	8.494758939983035
6738. he talked about unauthentic storylines too.	14.642252000992265
6739. he intimated that	they weren't doing the country much good in the cold war.	7.097674335188795
6740. and	to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism.	9.550209210218943
6741. in many corners of the globe he said the major	source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet.	10.506679962910768
6742. would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga	of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge?	7.506641292856578
6743.  yet for	much of the globe hollywood is just that- prime if not sole source	of knowledge.	6.118258069541965
6744. if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge	our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone what conclusions	do you think he might come to?	10.418687070756535
6745. 	francois d'albert hungarian-born violinist who made his	new york debut three years ago played a return engagement last night	in judson hall.	5.58392033276265
6746. he is now president of the chicago conservatory	college.	22.305220361446086
6747. his pianist was donald jenni a faculty member at depaul	university.	7.708925988359363
6748. the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged	by the artists so that for the first half of the program when	the	piano was partially open mr jenni's playing was too loud.	10.44071661064317
6749. in	vying with him mr d'albert also seemed to be overdriving his	tone.	5.509056355528969
6750. this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the	performances however except in the case of the opening work mozart's	sonata in a which clattered along noisily in	an unrelieved fashion.	10.266322263267066
6751. brahm's sonata in a although also	vigorous stood up well under the two artists' strong large-scale	treatment.	4.636687399434341
6752. mr d'albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews	an overly sweet vibrato.	6.698405051839266
6753. he made the most of the long brahmsian	phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work	a handsome performance.	9.15963619352141
6754. a sonata for violin and piano called	bella bella by robert fleming was given its first united	states performance.	8.728563137843292
6755. the title refers to the nickname given his	wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board	of canada.	9.490159583217016
6756. the work's two movements one melodically sentimental	the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a ravel-like	style but they rehash a wornout idiom.	5.807813978423723
6757. they might well indicate conjugal	felicity but in musical terms that smack of hollywood.	7.778134798288387
6758. works	by dohnanyi hubay mr d'albert himself and paganini	indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve	as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase.	6.350279523887146
6759. standard items	by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program.	4.837474804441568
6760. in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york	philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium but her program last night	at town hall was the greek-born pianist's first new york recital	since 1948.	8.899560227808395
6761. miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard	and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the	authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control.	6.737212794061397
6762. and the	tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.	10.478487304367459
6763. since she also	has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the	romantic tradition miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure.	7.02006024747243
6764. she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every	piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.	9.287123006702336
6765. the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers	of this century.	11.113575803780401
6766. it was in them that miss xydis was at her best.	20.719663084115076
6767. the rachmaninoff prelude no 12 op 32 for instance gave	her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities- the	ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them	simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.	4.898728024525818
6768. the	four kabalevsky preludes were also assured rich in color and songful.	8.845217805229556
6769. and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism	and modern bravura that prokofieff needs.	8.3473278145391
6770. miss	xydis'	earlier selections were mendelssohn's variations serieuses in which	each variation was nicely set off from the others; haydn's sonata	in e minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and chopin's	sonata in b flat minor.	4.699984747212051
6771. a memory lapse in the last somewhat	marred the pianist's performance.	7.164250298781984
6772. so what was the deepest music	on her program had the poorest showing.	10.285603393242114
6773. miss xydis was best when	she did not need to be too probing.	10.140974563169934
6774. all the generals who held important commands in world war	2 did not write books.	12.124541889751747
6775. it only seems as if they did.	17.253573785310643
6776. and the	best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written.	10.007490589520353
6777. one	of the very best is only now published in this country five years	after its first publication in england.	8.302467033971281
6778. it is defeat into victory	by field marshal viscount slim.	15.632423353207168
6779. a long book heavily	weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither	so long nor so technical as it was originally.	6.775683090099152
6780. field marshal slim	has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great	an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves are more	interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger.	8.634567079170859
6781. the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of	course the field marshal himself.	9.41845464432234
6782. william joseph slim	first viscount slim former governor general of australia was the	principal british commander in the field during the burma war.	9.106044235179587
6783. he	had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat	of 1942 when the ill-prepared ill-equipped british forces were outmaneuvered	outfought and outgeneraled.	4.725299885845184
6784. he returned in command of	an international army of gurkhas indians africans chinese and	british.	11.233617646657327
6785. and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles	and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most	brilliant campaigns of the war.	8.231469026028966
6786. the forgotten war his soldiers	called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe	enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.	10.645464576900366
6787. parts of defeat	into victory are a tangle of burmese place names and military	units but a little application makes everything clear enough.	5.90293765632337
6788. on	the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.	11.115227053786516
6789. field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes.	9.311207953952252
6790. he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit	mistakes and even a cardinal error.	12.132951725193587
6791. he praises many individuals	generously.	11.6141126138182
6792. he himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent	more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.	9.69068509489783
6793. an army to win	defeat into victory is a dramatic	and lively military narrative.	6.560484143919033
6794. but it is most interesting in its account	of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their	reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle	action.	11.355314075066069
6795. before he could return to burma field marshal	slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite	them with fresh recruits.	7.050392873112797
6796. his remarks about training discipline	morale leadership and command are enlightening.	9.314141091617444
6797. he believed in making	inspiring speeches and he made a great many.	11.742130858024634
6798. he believed in being	seen near the front lines and he was there.	14.114915789890933
6799. for general morale reasons	and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was	short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.	6.730402969267088
6800. other crucial matters required constant supervision:	labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too;	administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with	top brass- british american and chinese; health hygiene medical	aid and preventive medicine; hospitals and nurses	; food and military supplies; logistics and transport;	airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be built.	3.9228721544253715
6801. of a commander	commenting on these and other matters field	marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:   when	in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the	bolder.	5.998155027202267
6802. the commander has failed in his duty if he	has not won victory- for that is his duty.	8.590860486347882
6803. it only	does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which	others may have but which you cannot give them.	7.9898927634461385
6804. so	i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some	of it.	8.949555448054571
6805. field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage	of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders.	9.671929679597211
6806. of the japanese private he says: he fought and marched till	he died.	8.734081680057871
6807. if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to	kill 495 before it was ours- and then the last five killed themselves.	6.946989865317699
6808. brooding about future wars the field marshal has this	to say: the asian fighting man is at least equally brave as	the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental	doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by	slaughter and mutilation around him.	6.748033597720369
6809. he is by background and living	standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand	less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself	when thrown on his own resources.	7.6527621107747
6810. a bunch of young buckaroos from out west who go by the name	of texas boys choir loped into town hall last night and succeeded	in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.	8.803297716958433
6811. actually the	program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded	and they sang it beautifully.	4.584357073622362
6812. under the capable direction of the choir's	founder geroge bragg the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds	in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets	excerpts from pergolesi's stabat mater and all of the	britten ceremonial of carols.	6.5686332587568845
6813. their singing was well-balanced	clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing.	5.464606031499541
6814. the	limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices-	an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional	waver and now and then a bleat.	6.944493139390397
6815. but mr bragg is	a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with	his boys are generally superior.	7.88388037712143
6816. most surprising of all he has accomplished	some prodigies in training for the production of words.	11.985188894915886
6817. the latin	for example was not only clear; it was even beautiful.	7.466390739868479
6818. furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation	of the music.	9.519970771655299
6819. lines came out neatly and in good balance.	7.872206070465515
6820. the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish.	10.559304159134463
6821. a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and	a few other passages enchantingly.	5.761741800558573
6822. other capable soloists included	david clifton joseph schockler and pat thompson.	8.254963943690719
6823. the final	group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and	chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume.	6.315990749151625
6824. boys will be	boys and texans will be texans.	10.255672807547437
6825. the combination proved quite irresistible	last night.	10.91360233302862
6826. the polish song and dance company called mazowsze after	the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week	engagement at the city center last night.	8.133018460611588
6827. a thoroughly ingratiating	company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly	realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all	evening.	7.436084787768382
6828. not that it is all funny by any means though some	of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome	high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious	as it is varied.	9.660417838967403
6829. there is no use at all in trying to follow	it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format	and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses	for identification.	8.803754117908701
6830. the material is all basically of folk origin	gleaned from every section of poland.	10.68153379852175
6831. but under the direction of	mira ziminska-sygietynska who with her late husband founded the	organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated	selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators	and performed altogether professionally.	6.187499199165085
6832. under the surface of the	wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training	and an equally professional sense of performing.	9.604261966355672
6833. since	the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that	this is not the original company; it is more likely the sons and daughters	of that company.	6.901168037193462
6834. the girls are charming children and the men	are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters.	10.485659736146088
6835. the stage is constantly	full of them; indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on	stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers.	6.629422316096302
6836. they can be exuberant	or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they	seem unable to be is dull.	11.544877864371848
6837. to pick out particular numbers is	something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously	excellent to be missed.	6.951867311931463
6838. there is for example a stunning krakowiak	that closes the first act; the mazurka choreographed by witold	zapala to music from moniuszko's opera strasny dwor'	may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see; there	is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and songs from the tatras	contain a magnificent dance for the men.	7.110895188359879
6839. everywhere there are	little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians	is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments	with winning warmth.	6.285885010705528
6840. the matunuck presents king	of	hearts by jean kerr and eleanor brooke.	9.880510411528347
6841. directed by michael	murray; settings by william david roberts.	5.960430195438365
6842. the cast:	producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's	opener at matunuck in jean kerr's king of hearts.	5.605089178235565
6843. the dialogue is sharp witty and candid- typical don't eat	the daisies material- which has stamped the author throughout her	books and plays and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience	liked it.	4.458835774026195
6844. the story is of a famous strip cartoonist an	arty individual whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts	a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.	7.963158016565906
6845. this is	when his troubles begin not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires	and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect	to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.	6.5527778617632215
6846. john heffernan playing	larry larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion.	8.917591526002163
6847. his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.	5.779496167214714
6848. this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint	of david hedison providence's contribution to hollywood who is	appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox.	8.117544774231906
6849. not that	mr hedison does not make the most of his role.	12.21184857754426
6850. but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it	has to be that way.	11.928146380100415
6851. a word should be said for gary morgan a	broadway youngsters who as the adopted son makes life miserable for	nearly everybody and larkin in particular.	6.6752542949869875
6852. and for his playmate francis	coletta of west warwick who has a bit part billy.	11.385345773324287
6853. on the whole audiences will like this performance.	12.260302881969302
6854. it is a tremendous	book lively constantly moving and the matunuck cast does well	by it.	12.691891252552104
6855. the presents epitaph for	george dillon	by john osborne and anthony creighton directed by wallace	gray.	7.482158987476972
6856. the cast:    the angriest young man in	newport last night was at the playhouse where epitaph for george	dillon opened as the jazz festival closed.	7.521338949558792
6857. for the hero	of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered	by more than the lack of beer during a jam session.	7.674803305871212
6858. he's mad	at a world he did not make.	5.868577403292997
6859. furthermore he's something of	a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips.	4.953301028140501
6860. this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards.	27.194440951076125
6861. they not only	think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.	7.48835787931481
6862. it is into this	household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls	out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the	play.	10.957581026220883
6863. an unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only	in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists.	8.489564883259856
6864. by the end of the	third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other	shells.	12.559697446603966
6865. not altogether a successful play epitaph for	george dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in	a lesser work might be crippling.	6.3137611455466045
6866. it is awfully talky for instance	and not all of the talk is terribly impressive.	15.463322316723008
6867. but it strikes sparks	on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten.	10.497734939885843
6868. there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel groom	as dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage	after another.	14.079630278972989
6869. this is an exciting young actor to watch.	12.103150691519685
6870. just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart	whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch.	9.462884451441704
6871. miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an	icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment.	6.907759199257014
6872. also fine are	sue lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female	spider and just as destructive harold cherry as her scratchy	spouse and hildy weissman as a vegetable in human form.	7.325740216328646
6873. wallace	gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with	just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste.	6.798755383257193
6874. still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection	of that pale sustenance despair.	9.446244085323064
6875. the presents where's	charley?	13.2828527665774
6876.  with music and lyrics by frank loesser directed	by christopher hewett choreography by peter conlow musical direction	by samuel matlowsky.	9.237443851454014
6877. the cast:    everybody fell	in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater	and shelley berman was to blame.	6.0895438852087445
6878. one of the finest soft shoe	tunes ever invented once in love with amy is also of course	one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come	out of american musical comedy in our era.	9.861572396012289
6879. so the audience last	night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 got a rousing opening	chorus where's charley?	6.321802306178278
6880.  and berman sifted out all alone	on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering	into being.	8.91720049663662
6881. it is greatly to berman's credit that he	made no attempt to outdo ray bolger.	8.577971545607495
6882. he dropped his earlier and delightful	hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse	called charley's aunt and let himself go with as an appealing	an amy as anybody could ask.	9.478281633345347
6883. in brief berman played	himself and not bolger.	9.59612087771105
6884. the big audience started applauding even	before he had finished.	10.875936291776082
6885. the whole production this week is fresh	and lively.	9.103257488081507
6886. the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous	gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days.	9.843325130134826
6887. the ballet work	is on the nose especially in the opening number by the new ashmolean	marching society and students' conservatory band along	with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later.	5.8773901181080985
6888. berman whose	fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist	proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.	10.552689531041919
6889. sparrow-size	virginia gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful	smile made a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon as the real	aunt was positively	monumental in the very best gibson girl manner.	5.301099819461823
6890. all told where's charley?	13.958213404100489
6891.  ought not to be missed.	15.085561932677512
6892. it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only	a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right mr	berman.	11.225760130619697
6893. the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c	edwin knill's and martin tahse's production of	at veterans memorial auditorium.	4.7052385729382
6894. the book is by jerome	weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyrics by sheldon	harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costumes and	lighting by william and jean eckart musical direction by jack elliott	and the production was directed by mr abbott.	7.6104721796793005
6895. the cast:	this is one of the happier events of the season.	9.427870504452297
6896. the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night	and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians	are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the little	flower rides to break a lance again.	7.792962014297114
6897. i saw fiorello!	performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company	is every bit as good and perhaps better.	7.690582714592363
6898. certainly in the matter	of principals there is nothing lacking.	13.206110264335544
6899. bob carroll may not bear	quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley	does but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello	as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and	remember that this wasn't really laguardia come back among us again.	5.334601281972652
6900. then rudy bond was simply grand as ben the distraught	republican party district chieftain.	9.06643052175854
6901. and paul lipson as morris	the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley's dinner was	fine too.	5.549201428154287
6902. as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity	and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest	little man.	10.280915074758681
6903. charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie	who became the second mrs laguardia singing and acting with	remarkable conviction.	5.517629982773648
6904. jen nelson as thea his first wife managed	to make that short role impressive.	7.841943144263373
6905. and little zeme north a dora	with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of	her love for floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then	is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings.	5.406420028595086
6906. such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual	treatment of on the side of the angels and politics and poker	were handled splendidly and i thought rudy bond and his band	of tuneful ward-heelers made little tin box even better than	it was done by the new york cast; all the words of its clever	lyrics came through with perfect clarity.	8.032242164605302
6907. the party at floyd's	penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic	through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic	statement of the era's nonsense.	5.616938660042502
6908. laguardia's multi-lingual	rallies when he is running for congress are well staged	and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical	theater.	6.47093099359198
6909. martin tahse has established quite a reputation for	himself as a successful stager of touring productions.	6.325628740510535
6910. not a corner	has been visibly cut in this one.	11.917669241459018
6911. the sets are remarkably elaborate	for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place and they	are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness.	5.6151347421804685
6912. being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience	with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their	eyes.	10.435290069458015
6913. i'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this	it has all been done in superb style	and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts	who enjoys good musical theater.	4.979056704271864
6914. presents	an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed	by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells.	6.964799667376748
6915. the cast:	since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich brown	senior while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists i suppose	i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on where the	boys are but i shall do nothing of the sort.	5.143331574509891
6916. instead-	and not just to prove my objectivity- i hasten to report that it's	a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of	reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort	lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with	the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group-	that is to say sex.	7.3144495220200785
6917. the answers the girls give struck	me as reasonably varied and healthily individual.	7.29505899074796
6918. if most of them weren't	exactly specific- well that's the way it is in life i guess.	9.909295718446142
6919. but at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't	profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems	instead.	6.181779371883875
6920. where the boys are also has a juvenile bounce	that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy.	10.752709619472373
6921. there are some sharp	and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations- the best	of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where	a mermaid is performing.	5.887819414233822
6922. most of the female faces are	new or at least not too familiar.	16.5806855594928
6923. dolores hart is charming in a leading	role and quite believable.	6.229068746983869
6924. i was delighted with paula prentiss'	comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one's	highest hopes might ask.	7.492775462295396
6925. a couple of the males made good comedy too-	jim hutton and frank gorshin.	7.1193886221602884
6926. the only performance which	was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux but since someone	had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things	do happen at these fracases i suppose this was the attitude the	part called for.	9.262225886506844
6927. i must say however that i preferred the acting that	had something of a biting edge to it.	9.366656618969815
6928. to anyone who remembers	newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the	boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz	festival ought to prove entertaining.	9.677416994569363
6929. the second feature	is a british detective story that	will talk your head off.	7.275645131913117
6930. the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james	was never more evident than in his letters.	9.692726699947857
6931. here was a man with an	enormous gift for living as well as thinking.	14.60007338964613
6932. to both persons and ideas	he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish	for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and	quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment.	7.583033022828951
6933. for	this latest addition to the great letters series under the general	editorship of louis kronenberger miss hardwick has made a selection	which admirably displays the variety of james's genius not	to mention the felicities of his style.	5.452174346871609
6934. and how he could write!	his famous criticism of brother henry's third style is surely	as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter's intricate	air castles as henry himself could ever have produced.	5.865776649771513
6935. his letter	to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant	forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up	penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing	good humor.	6.307401882285757
6936. most of all his letters to his philosophic	colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help	to explain whitehead's reference to james as that adorable genius.	9.549121630097321
6937. miss hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual	friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life	lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.	6.895107792032952
6938. this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where	there seems to be an increasing lack of communication- or even desire	for communication- between differing schools of thought.	9.447116387231427
6939. it holds	an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual	has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people	who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human	virtues.	6.818906128932624
6940. to his harvard colleague josiah royce whose philosophic	position differed radically from his own james could write	different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other	social influence ever has and in converse with you i have always felt	that my life was being lived importantly.	7.495801088633953
6941. of another colleague	george santayana he could write: the great event in	my life recently has been the reading of santayana's book.	6.147012060251879
6942. although	i absolutely reject the platonism of it i have literally squealed	with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position	is laid down on page after page.	8.033792369078594
6943. writing to his colleague	george herbert palmer- glorious old palmer as he addresses	him- james says that if only the students at harvard could really	understand royce santayana palmer and himself and see that	their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life	and worth fighting for then harvard would have a genuine philosophic	universe.	5.639712451869271
6944. the best condition of it would be an open conflict	and rivalry of the diverse systems h.	11.352124021249146
6945. the world might ring with the	struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other.	7.538659050410098
6946. the belaboring is of course jocular yet james was	not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless we measure him by	that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who	stakes all on his vision of god.	7.279219590884891
6947. to james this vision never quite	came despite his appreciation of it in others.	8.470283780087678
6948. but there is a	dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one	correspondent:	you ask what i am going to 'reply' to bradley.	10.275857153061141
6949. but why need one reply to everything and everybody?	10.86483156983789
6950.  h i think	that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.	10.236420852563366
6951. all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statements	of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible	impersonally h.	6.274476383030371
6952. as far as the rising generation goes why not simply	express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly	will displace the other.	10.649942551561363
6953. here again 'god will know his own'.	7.4389705832125825
6954. the collected works of james thurber now numbering 25 volumes	represent a high standard of literary	excellence as every schoolboy knows.	9.442233446201538
6955. the primitive-eclogue quality	of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall	is equally well known.	6.000682650545301
6956. about all that remains to be said is that the	present selection most of which appeared first in the new yorker	comprises a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little	more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the	book.	10.860465553613784
6957. the one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial	article entitled: how to get through the day.	6.391608873852863
6958. it is repeated	at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs	the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources	including palindromes paraphrases	and parodies.	8.736839924289526
6959. the tyranny of trivia suggests	arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber.	7.564714544896365
6960. and new vistas	of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled:	friends romans countrymen lend me your ear-muffs	such a phrase as drifts through dream and the new vocabularianism.	6.104644963725939
6961. some of thurber's curative methods involve strong	potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended	for use only in extreme cases.	5.767669452200248
6962. a burlesque paean	entitled: hark the herald tribune times and all the other	angels sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture	ballyhooey.	6.991491161558977
6963. how the kooks crumble features an amusingly	accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv	commercials and the watchers of the night is a veritable	waking nightmare.	4.698942412322278
6964. a semi-serious literary document entitled	the wings of henry james is noteworthy if only for a keenly	trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult	later period by modest owen wister author of the virginian.	6.045519957132035
6965. james he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible	h namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces	upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions.	7.403561889820631
6966. he	would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you	could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings	and complexities.	12.603422934869165
6967. equally penetrating in its fashion is	the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation:	so much has already been written about everything that you can't	find out anything about it.	5.647940186196575
6968. or the mildly epigrammatic utterance	: woman's place is in the wrong.	8.313395745665405
6969. who	but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences?	6.13289858590014
6970. 	a tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny	though it would be hard to explain why.	7.591470264358452
6971. one of them banged the sash	of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped	out of sleep and out of bed.	8.35328186998051
6972. 'it's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly	and i sighed with relief.	5.422514272935638
6973. 'thank god for that' i said;	'i thought it was a human being'.	4.404480600440683
6974. in a sense	perhaps thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter	who first conceived the startling fancy of	a picture window in the abdomen.	8.452799050803286
6975. that is it is literally a picture	window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture- trees	or flowers.	4.157473871035644
6976. this is something like what thurber's best effects	are like if i am not mistaken.	10.845227529288683
6977. though no longer able to turn	out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches	thurber has retained unimpaired	his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness.	5.688393310034352
6978. in	his concluding paragraph he writes: the devoted writer of humor	will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can.	8.286010531470792
6979. for many	readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight.	8.547530557938378
6980. the latest low is a puzzler.	13.51272689120034
6981. the master's hand has lost none	of its craft.	5.439261673351109
6982. he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions	of political and diplomatic life in the fifties.	10.587443207275024
6983. the reader	meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse and	becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like	the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the	nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out.	6.080330103554156
6984. but there	is a difference between the present volume and the early low.	15.483316195990716
6985. there	is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings	show.	8.56286564347411
6986. but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were	on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning.	13.616656935667919
6987. anyone	can draw his own conclusions from this difference.	7.039002582378518
6988. it might be	argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish	the artist with drama in a lower key.	10.754058845965526
6989. but this argument cannot be	pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings	of its leaders in respect to corrosion.	7.568539848158415
6990. the communists wield	a power unknown to hitler.	12.018485581664825
6991. and the leading issue that of piecemeal	aggression remains the same.	9.432998601846387
6992. do we ourselves	offer mr low less of a crusade?	13.100754292210333
6993.  in the thirties we would	not face our enemy; that was a nightmarish situation and low was	in his element.	6.643571139855286
6994. now we have stood up to the communists; we are stronger	and more self-confident- and low cannot so easily put us to rights.	8.033709966305844
6995. or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere?	9.52258800825088
6996. 	it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they	do not outrage him now.	7.760999598332364
6997. he writes confucius held that in times	of stress one should take short views- only up to lunchtime.	6.357497387637984
6998. whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above	the level of the capably sardonic.	10.804659532130698
6999. dulles?	12.348350321510317
7000.  he does not seem to have	caught the subtleties of the man.	21.601590395011495
7001. mccarthy?	12.348350321510317
7002.  the skies turn dark	but the clouds do not loose their wrath.	9.907269033129927
7003. suez?	12.348350321510317
7004.  low seems to have	supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently	so there is no fire in his eye.	9.47831945071262
7005. stalin's death	churchill's farewell to public life hillary and tensing on everest	quemoy and matsu- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.	4.0483381074357085
7006. instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles.	17.39651031065289
7007. did low decide to let well enough alone when	he made his selections?	7.48279993941729
7008.    he often drew the bomb.	16.39599297442763
7009. he showed puny	men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines.	8.323384207279775
7010. and khrushchev turned	out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all.	10.395970196025424
7011. look in this book for weak mortals and only	on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale.	7.380605762942937
7012. read the moderately	brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once	in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas.	10.65881821841842
7013. a gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man city slicker	lebensraum specialist- tries to take over catfish bend in this	third relaxed allegory from mr burman's refreshing louisiana	animal community.	4.300530568359094
7014. the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he	arrives from new orleans accompanied by one wharf rat.	9.587693926629324
7015. but like all	despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows	more threatening toward those who won't follow- such solid citizens	as doc raccoon; judge black the vegetarian black snake;	and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in	washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.	4.368470680774853
7016. as soon as the fox	has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who	of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination	campaign	in the city.	10.562824647273429
7017. about the very things	they train the mink	and other animals to fight.	7.296988736805476
7018. and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that	he won't have anyone around that's against him and setting out	to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.	5.959655731050566
7019. robert	hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal	fable that mr burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish	bend series.	7.280395475578862
7020. he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be	given fewer prizes.	12.433368368966416
7021. but it's hard to imagine mr burman as a nobel	laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous	fables.	5.532721961751772
7022. in substance they lie somewhere between the southern	dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris and	the polished witty fables of james thurber.	7.94072554312905
7023. george kennan's account of relations between russia and the	west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 is the	finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.	8.836749224661428
7024. it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: scrupulous	scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization	and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.	8.01406515226647
7025. in short the book based largely on lectures delivered at harvard	university is both reliable and readable; the author possesses	an uncommonly fine english style and he is dealing with subjects	of vast importance that are highly topical for our time.	5.871343819954269
7026. if mr	kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis	of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars	and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic- well the	record itself is not too encouraging.	7.530543571083358
7027. mr kennan takes careful	account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical	atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken.	6.132139797195745
7028. but he rejects	perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-communist	influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin	which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high	point at the yalta conference in february 1945.	10.928855183450844
7029. after all	alger hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he	gave secret state department documents to soviet agents was at yalta.	6.169125516887455
7030. and harry dexter white implicated in fbi reports	in communist associations was one of the architects of the morgenthau	plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have	simply handed germany to stalin.	10.059682209125102
7031. one item in this unhappy scheme was	to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors	among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength.	6.319572801126105
7032. it is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and	childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had	more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than	treason or sympathy with communism.	11.441959898373323
7033. mr kennan sums up his judgment	of what went wrong this way:	you see	first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable	american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender:	the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as	a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given	status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and	total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought	to the complete destruction of the enemy's power no matter what disadvantages	or complications this might involve for the more distant	future.	6.544698728574857
7034. recognizing that there could have been no effective	negotiated peace with hitler he points out the shocking failure to	give support to the anti-nazi underground which very nearly eliminated	hitler in 1944.	8.191028574585543
7035. a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge	of russian language history and literature kennan recalls how at	the time of hitler's attack on the soviet union in 1941 he penned	a private note to a state department official expressing the hope	that never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in	the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries.	5.454385865647288
7036. with justified bitterness the author speaks of what	seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the	nature of the russian communist movement about the history of its	diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had	been going on in poland and the baltic states.	9.88360567323872
7037. he also speaks of	franklin d roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only	he could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone	like fdr himself ideological preconceptions would melt and	russia's co-operation with the west could be easily arranged.	4.937234411649867
7038. no wonder khrushchev's first message to president kennedy	was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of roosevelt.	9.919812942045887
7039. this fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in	personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 and	the two instalments of the russian revolution.	7.612982979160072
7040. the first of these	involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government	in march 1917; the second the seizure of power by the bolsheviks	in november of the	same year.	8.569031228216705
7041. as kennan shows the judgment of the allied governments	about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession	of defeating germany.	7.261244510345756
7042. they were blind to the evidence that nothing	could keep the russian people fighting.	11.671077427964974
7043. they attributed everything	that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue.	7.916213331867583
7044. this	more than any other factor led to the fiasco of allied intervention.	10.109189047413757
7045. as the author very justly says:   had a world war not been	in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the	imagination have been an allied intervention in north russia.	6.620194661860998
7046. the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated	by communist propaganda; here kennan operating with precise	facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking.	7.166262190658659
7047. dictators	of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's	vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators	whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may	be selected.	5.353743145777246
7048. on stalin:   this was a man of incredible criminality	of a criminality effectively without limits; a man apparently	foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity;	a man in whose entourage none was ever safe; a man whose hand was set	against all that could not be useful to him at the moment; a man who	was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators	in crime h.	6.857672885477766
7049. and here is kennan's image of hitler	stalin's	temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of	weaker peoples and his later enemy:   behind that charlie	chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered	his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate	orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices	the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency	to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities:	shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed- like	stalin- with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing	his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and	resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift stalin did not	possess: the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion	and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word.	4.57365383307394
7050. two criticisms	of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment	of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges- there is	no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan.	6.680569173467277
7051. and	in a concluding chapter about america's stance in the contemporary	world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come	to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: how to deal with	a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.	4.532993767481017
7052. but one should not ask for everything.	16.81749259431273
7053. mr kennan who has recently	abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently	appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia is not the only man who	finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.	7.300121071977272
7054. the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations	is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical	narrator.	11.848060600624398
7055. the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter	political	or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit	and charm.	6.741235997418065
7056. in donnybrook there is quite a different eire a	rural land where singing dancing fist-fighting and romancing are the	thing.	8.118450201776335
7057. there is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence	and no one gets killed.	14.228856421234267
7058. by and large robert mcenroe's adaptation	of maurice walsh's film the quiet man provides	the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if	not a superlative one.	7.659389597683815
7059. this is the tale of one john enright	an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring	and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become	a quiet man.	8.210851697977901
7060. but innesfree where ellen roe danaher and her	bullying brother will live is no place for a man who will not use	his fists.	11.535356033472445
7061. so enright's courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded	considerably thereby providing the tale which is told.	5.489925543366648
7062. you may be	sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with	the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way	to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means.	11.139247053511236
7063. then there is a matchmaker one mikeen flynn a role for which eddie	foy was happily selected.	9.100435056106164
7064. now there is no reason in the world why	a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe	dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck	except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.	10.150263177837035
7065. mr foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it	until he is practically perfect.	6.5164436162864945
7066. his matchmaking is naturally incidental	and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes	him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.	8.54231619831728
7067. art lund a fine	big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates	enright.	6.791106981919036
7068. although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic	technique that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have	anyway.	8.376269793385282
7069. joan fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she	has a temper whether she really has one or not plays ellen and sings	the role very well too.	5.557799865165357
7070. if the mettle which ellen exhibits has	a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind; she fits into the general	scheme well enough.	8.39583975338674
7071. susan johnson as the widow spends the	first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented	death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new	one.	7.8392550157164855
7072. she has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues	of the evening.	10.736582292555566
7073. then there are a pair of old biddies played	by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf	of stock irish characters but they put such a combination of good	will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining.	6.247356324684919
7074. and in the role of will danaher philip bosco roars and sneers	sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british	army if he chose.	10.504269935775218
7075. donnybrook is no brigadoon	but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some	excellent dancing.	6.004089360147892
7076. the ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally	competent.	12.393377721358215
7077. it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after	the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy sez i	does.	9.747808323002237
7078. a toast to the bride sung by clarence nordstrom playing	a character called old man toomey is quite simple direct and	touching.	8.024612543812005
7079. the men of innesfree are got up authentically in	cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine.	7.088984026325787
7080. so is	that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep	under jack cole's expert choreographic direction.	6.804206227264996
7081. the male dancers	sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and	stimulating.	7.724753541485325
7082. rouben ter-arutunian in his stage settings	often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr cole has placed couples	or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.	7.42023463825064
7083. there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty	good time at donnybrook unless they are permanently in the	mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable	irish.	9.023751673489945
7084. we can all breathe more easily this morning- more easily	and joyously too- because joshua logan has turned the stage show	fanny into a delightful and heart-warming film.	6.432120496696306
7085. the	task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol's original trio	of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting	them again on the screen after their passage through the broadway	musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed.	5.307777275487472
7086. more than	the fans of pagnol's old films and of their heroic star the great	raimu were looking askance at the project.	7.355106186267052
7087. the fans of the musical	were too.	9.693628136056246
7088. but now the task is completed and the uncertainty	resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music	hall yesterday.	10.726087094645875
7089. whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show whether	partial to music or no you can't help but derive joy from this	picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.	5.928304456493527
7090. some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in	the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow.	12.837359127461076
7091. a tiny handful never did make the concert.	8.756146152263549
7092. but after a fifteen-minute	delay the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage	for the afternoon's proceedings.	8.198330008763698
7093. they faced a rather small audience	as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures	of the afternoon.	7.41084985822913
7094. it was an excellent concert.	25.42609256205644
7095. paul	paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid	musician and the philharmonic plays for him.	6.074351382390965
7096. their collaboration in	the beethoven second symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding.	8.406333240411755
7097. it was not a heavy ponderous beethoven.	17.40139265676251
7098. the music sang nicely	sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced.	9.767286903889207
7099. the franck symphonic poem psyche is a	lush	sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again.	5.423422811079997
7100. fortunate	for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor; if	it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.	7.52278090211366
7101. mr paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic	elements of the score.	6.392932905557068
7102. he did not let the strings for instance	weep whine or get hysterical.	13.547276706632717
7103. his interpretation was a model of refinement	and accuracy.	9.505642187091356
7104. and in the prokofieff c major piano	concerto with zadel skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner.	11.157548685162608
7105. mr skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping	and tonally percussive.	6.126448006184617
7106. he swept through the music with ease in a	non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner.	9.210565105449655
7107. an impressive technician	mr skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot.	6.9848705750210875
7108. his tone is the	weakest part of his equipment; it tends to be hard and colorless.	9.680389594995253
7109. a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this	concerto needs.	7.52395829660864
7110. it is after all a non-romantic work	; and the composer himself	was called the age of steel pianist.	10.801378692547523
7111. but granted all this one	still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than	mr skolovsky supplied.	7.3934623578241165
7112. taken as a whole though it was	a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra.	10.52955714070992
7113. mr skolovsky	fully deserved the warm reception he received.	7.552864162961833
7114. a new work on	the program was nikolai lopatnikoff's festival overture	receiving its first new york hearing.	8.17959955756011
7115. this was composed last year as	a salute to the automobile industry.	9.011118545275076
7116. it is not program music though.	27.361649586071376
7117. it runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical	and featureless.	11.123100107771364
7118. la gioconda like it or not is a singer's opera.	11.086790105967523
7119. and	so of course it is a fan's opera as well.	7.292490583729084
7120. snow or no the fans	were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance	of the ponchielli work.	9.982528278591655
7121. so the plot creaks the sets	are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy	and not very well connected with what the singers were doing.	5.848227036656812
7122. after	all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed	with no less than six leading parts.	9.574472847700303
7123. one of those parts	is that of evil evil barnaba the spy.	10.865783528330986
7124. his wicked deeds were carried	on by anselmo colzani who was taking the part for the first time	with the company.	9.243088421873694
7125. he has the temperament and the stage presence	for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone.	7.760963210775631
7126. what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing	that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after	all a very oily character.	10.22518152876163
7127. regina resnik as laura and cesare	siepi as alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect	to this season; they have both sung these parts here before.	5.07334371637948
7128. laura	is a good role for miss resnik and she gave it force dramatic color	and passion.	8.397584101615875
7129. mr siepi was as always a consummate actor;	with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently.	5.564788539959517
7130. part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the	vocal chords.	18.678917427538853
7131. his singing was strong and musical; unfortunately his	voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.	6.093947468927521
7132. eileen farrell	in the title role mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker	as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and	all contributed to a vigorous performance.	6.883125336560466
7133. if only they and fausto	cleva in the pit had got together a bit more.	8.738818164862977
7134. melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no	better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could	be imagined.	7.838904002327556
7135. their vanguard album	is a good sample of the special	elegant art of english madrigal singing.	6.899003661476504
7136. it also makes a fine introduction	to the international art form with good examples of italian	and english madrigals plus several french chansons.	10.198991154719273
7137. the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better	than anyone else.	7.301828635810466
7138. the original impulses came to england late	and continue strong long after everyone else had	gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like.	8.763201114812333
7139. even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian	interregnum the practice of singing together- choruses catches	and glees- always flourished.	5.20000113029986
7140. the english never again developed	a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier	great age the way say the opera in italy blotted out the italian	madrigal.	9.058618901462989
7141. latter-day interest in elizabethan singing	dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead	of similar revivals in other countries.	6.349729929730125
7142. as a result no comparable	literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more	often performed than the english madrigal.	11.657980828393239
7143. naturally mr	deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant	when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their	countrymen: william byrd thomas morley and thomas tomkins.	5.175292796754914
7144. there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency	to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.	12.873765431321287
7145. both techniques give the music purity and clarity.	8.028771756919367
7146. claude	jannequin's vocal description of a battle	is	lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other	chansons by jannequin and lassus.	8.249531939208536
7147. only with the more sensual intense	and baroque expressions of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo	does the singing seem a little superficial.	6.289475409420897
7148. nevertheless the	musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently	reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period.	7.556338455072238
7149. the	works are presented chronologically.	7.985549884977639
7150. texts and translations are provided.	9.587557300422638
7151. the elements of elegance and color in jannequin	are strong french characteristics.	10.194732306446339
7152. baroque instrumental music	in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled	and quite abstract.	8.072177616669643
7153. in france it remained always more picturesque	more dancelike more full of flavor.	8.155779851624244
7154. couperin and rameau	gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense	of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close	clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.	8.55222277087275
7155. both composers turn up on new imports from france.	8.261960407794344
7156. bam	is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is	editions de la boite a musique.	7.603862488838362
7157. they specialize in out-of-the-way	items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention.	7.193320006902689
7158. of couperin le grand occupy	two disks and reveal the impeccable taste	and workmanship of this master- delicate flexible and gemlike.	7.535084204010531
7159. the concerts- nos 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented-	are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian	sense.	5.2362556339950395
7160. the sonatas la francaise la sultane l'astree	and l'imperiale are often more elaborately worked	out and in fact show a strong italian influence.	6.903011483903517
7161. couperin	also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk	called	.	5.940936589670411
7162. jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit but bodin de	beismortier corrette and mondonville are hardly household words.	6.35416003407688
7163. what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal	the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo.	7.924289575544233
7164. the couperin la steinkerque with its battle music brevity	wit and refined simplicity already shakes off corelli and points	towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era.	6.709641940572657
7165. if	couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more.	6.94567430549282
7166. all these records have close attractive sound and the performances	by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.	9.971126901488821
7167. rameau's	recorded by l'orchestre de	chambre pierre menet turn out to be harpsichord	pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.	5.57769247611616
7168. the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes	inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.	8.549650017050007
7169. maitres	allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music	by pachelbel buxtehude rosenmueller and telemann well performed	by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket	.	4.450571842493914
7170. rococo music- a lot of it- was played in carnegie recital	hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored	this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts.	8.170399890218183
7171. works by j c bach anton craft joseph haydn giuseppe	sammartini comenico dragonetti and j g janitsch were	performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff flutist	josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist.	4.438727190723957
7172. since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all	it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown	accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven	to boulez.	7.329675110456115
7173. thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century	charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday	night.	6.487137808841513
7174. each might find a useful place in a varied musical program	but taken together they grew quite tiresome.	8.868578458814842
7175. the performances	were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying	some by soloists proving rather trying.	6.723491554458415
7176. ellie mao soprano and frederick fuller baritone presented	a program of folksongs entitled east meets west in carnegie	recital hall last night.	7.061432621820398
7177. they were accompanied by anna mi lee	pianist.	11.974431661122562
7178. selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos	and duets in a broad range of languages.	8.6736752221168
7179. songs from china and japan	were reserved exclusively for miss mao who is a native of china	and those of the british isles were sung by mr fuller who is	english by birth.	6.568863486948882
7180. this was not a program intended to illustrate	authentic folk styles.	16.43645085546683
7181. on the contrary miss mao and mr fuller	chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such	as mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten.	7.496748650098544
7182. thre	was	therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been	the case otherwise.	8.414404853461944
7183. the performances were assured communicative and	pleasingly informal.	8.561454534053698
7184. what was omitted from a neglected education were	those essentials known as the facts of life.	12.2527221891211
7185. chabrier's	little one-act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at town hall	is a fragile precious little piece very french not without wit	and charm.	4.643237598865933
7186. the poor uneducated newlywed a certain gontran de boismassif	has his problems in getting the necessary information.	9.006092912289203
7187. the humor	of the situation can be imagined.	9.156151287030514
7188. it all takes place in the	eighteenth century.	20.40027659054399
7189. what a silly artificial way of life chabrier	and his librettists chuckle.	9.700769924574741
7190. but they wish they could bring it back.	16.506301427080192
7191. chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where	the classical rationalist tradition	becomes virtually neo-classicism.	5.282700157987854
7192. the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste	and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or	mawkish.	8.084987471694735
7193. the simple clever production was also able to tread	the thin line between those extremes.	7.688047603783016
7194. arlene saunders was charming as	poor gontran.	8.750500588045817
7195. yes arlene is her name; the work uses the old eighteenth-century	tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced	youth to a soprano.	6.53485607215143
7196. benita valente was delightful as the young wife	and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.	8.606146795582552
7197. the work was presented as the final event in the town	hall festival of music.	9.032284001887719
7198. it was paired with a darius milhaud opera	the poor sailor set to a libretto by jean cocteau a	kind of grand guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and	gets done in by his wife.	8.523795842658139
7199. with the exception of a few spots	milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties	odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration.	6.846148692366799
7200. had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon.	11.27046236244208
7201. sat there	and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right	before my eyes and the eyes of some 5500 other people.	6.447259589195493
7202. i make	this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she brought	up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female	reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote	in the paper the next day:   judy garland has arrived	in london.	7.517699464211278
7203. she's not plump.	4.746697687792299
7204. but who cares when the lady sings?	15.44467612934965
7205.  certainly not the largest	afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the	most attentive and quiet.	6.853987707419461
7206. they applauded every number not only at its	conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes	at the first chord.	10.13470030936147
7207. and judy sang the lovely old familiar things	which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions	of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings.	5.6943396003008155
7208. things like when you're smiling almost like being in	love do it again born to wander alone together	who cares?	6.9297345549805645
7209.  puttin' on the ritz how	long has this been going on?	5.209184556717421
7210.  and her own personal songs	like the man that got away and the inevitable over the	rainbow.	13.193377653444752
7211. miss garland is not only one of the great singers	of our time but she is one of the superb showmen.	11.842869040239027
7212. at the start of	her program there were evidences of pique.	15.630282369355953
7213. she had held to the letter	of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4	pm the appointed hour although the music at newport people had	tried to get the program underway at 3.	5.675200495940918
7214. then there was a bad delay	in getting mort lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.	9.3626379985222
7215. along about 4:30 just when it was getting to be about time	to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side judy	came on singing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket	that flapped in the wind.	6.787212074851442
7216. her bouffant coiffure was fortunately	combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk	breeze was blowing.	9.996687843297401
7217. in her first song she waved away one	encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter	the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm lenses	and shoot at extreme range.	5.776405627174106
7218. there also came a brief contretemps	with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during	a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and	she made the tart observation that i never saw so much moving about	in an audience.	9.132917081257913
7219. but it didn't take judy garland showman	long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at	newport and that you have to learn to live with it.	9.232173326826437
7220. before her chore	was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling	microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining	in the informal atmosphere.	7.527270875242795
7221. and time after time she really	belted out her songs.	8.897897166540755
7222. sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged-	which was the way i felt about her come rain or come	shine- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her	shatteringly beautiful beautiful weather.	7.349645293553642
7223. to her partisan	audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than	a critic striving to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their	haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough.	5.899932231746011
7224. they were rewarded with splendid exciting singing.	12.412972643326265
7225. her rockabye	your baby was as good as it can be done and her really	personal songs like the man that got away were deeply moving.	9.999476336302399
7226. the audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard	over the rainbow- although the fellow that kept crying for	get happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway.	7.227438048794567
7227. she	was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with	its cheers and applause and flowers.	6.432165017391008
7228. all went home happy except	the newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6:35	might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of	their happy hour at the cocktail bar.	6.31484696735445
7229. in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning	in the northern skies.	8.592001315718665
7230. this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the	evening- flashes in the distance but no storm.	10.003752920213683
7231. several times	it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder	from jerry mulligan's big band which is about as fine an aggregation	as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond	found count basie working in a kansas city trap.	5.975757775250848
7232. mulligan's	band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it	does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the	big concert aggregations.	7.259587874265937
7233. but what is equally impressive is	the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan's	baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer's arrangement	of django's castle.	5.562476722664938
7234. for subtle swinging rhythms	i could admire intensely mulligan's version of weep and	the fireworks went on display in 18 carrots for robert a sax	tribute to johnny hodges.	6.890257664044592
7235. there was considerable contrast	between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the	jazz messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such	a small group.	7.744537508725612
7236. unfortunately blakey doesn't choose to work much	of the time in this vein.	8.335280894192586
7237. he prefers to have his soloist performing	and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.	7.378938440758324
7238. what we did get however was impressive.	16.437908850940783
7239. a few drops	of rain just before midnight when sarah vaughan was in the midst of	her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly	but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listeners	didn't care whether they got wet.	7.009409602817523
7240. miss vaughan was back	in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time-	like a fine wine.	7.567905909878731
7241. after the spate of female vocalists we have been	having all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried	to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed	that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than	ever.	7.821984247169685
7242. the evening program was opened	by the jazz three a newport group consisting of steve budieshein	on bass jack warner drums and don cook piano.	8.95147777166029
7243. this was a	continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night	when the eddie stack group also local talent went on first.	7.144838629215992
7244. putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple	purpose: it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in	this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux;	it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have	come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance	to perform before the famous newport audience.	7.569821838032181
7245. the jazz three	displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set	but as the emergency accompanists for al minns + leon james the	superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three	successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution	of the blues to a spot on the evening program.	5.291303228947018
7246. sings	julie wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists	sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old	oldies as hard-hearted hannah the vamp of savannah and	the delightful sunday.	7.46423270314667
7247. she frosted the cake with the always reliable	bill bailey.	7.949115615833791
7248. from this taste of the 1920s we	leaped way out to stan getz's private brand of progressive jazz	which did lovely subtle things for baubles bangles and beads	and a couple of ballards.	7.737212794920352
7249. getz is a difficult musician to categorize.	8.40850605941575
7250. he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than	for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has	a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising	is over.	8.00918497827134
7251. in this he is sticking with tradition however far removed	from it he may seem to be.	8.702699368185739
7252. george shearing	took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of	vibes guitar bass drums shearing's piano and a bongo drummer.	6.714507048522123
7253. he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung	from jazz to latin american things like the mambo.	8.835806023119813
7254. shearing himself	seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport	appearances.	11.151144740586595
7255. a very casual pleasant program- one of those	easy-going things that make newport's afternoon programs such a	relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh	breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came	to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.	5.104521717697447
7256. divided	almost equally into two parts it consisted of the evolution of	the blues narrated by jon hendricks who had presented it last	year at the monterey calif jazz festival and an hour-long session	of maynard ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band.	6.516198561573844
7257. hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small	audience of small children right on stage with him.	7.162095126785445
7258. tracing the blues	from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country	and the west indies he stressed the close relationship between	the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches.	8.819370110708626
7259. addition	to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz	he had big miller as a preacher-singer and hannah dean gospel-singer	while oscar brown jr an extremely talented young	man did a slave auctioneer's call a field-hands' work song and	a beautifully sung negro lullaby brown baby which was one of	the truly moving moments of the festival.	4.0930824654530635
7260. one of those delightful	surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs	was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones drumming	to old man river which seems to have been elected the favorite	solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.	8.807597694124713
7261. demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues	was michael babatunde olatunji who plays such native drums as	the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest.	4.990371314450857
7262. he	has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of	last year's afternoon concerts.	8.757772379403615
7263. hendricks had billy mitchell	tenor	sax; pony poindexter alto sax; jimmy witherspoon	blues singer and the ike isaacs trio which has done	such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical	examples.	4.811468602334725
7264. it all went very well.	22.05305423164498
7265. pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know	the interesting material contained in schubert's sonatas.	6.326552685844123
7266. music	lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent	example played for rca by emil gilels.	8.067980401299419
7267. he has chosen sonata	op 53 in d.	11.772830514638125
7268. the playing takes both sides of the disc.	14.211025016402077
7269. perhaps	one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often	is their great length.	6.346841909814779
7270. rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness	of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention	with the gilels playing.	6.256457272074716
7271. his technique is ample and his musical ideas	are projected beautifully.	6.736344423240941
7272. the male chorus of the robert	shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style.	9.716063413600832
7273. the group is superbly	trained.	14.277927774287882
7274. what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type	of song is in question.	11.551814916207585
7275. do you say chantey as if the word were derived	from the french word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think	of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the french-canadian	use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as	a boat-yard?	6.655986678645999
7276.  i say chantey.	24.249732364993754
7277. either way the robert shaw chorus	sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame	spelled out in terms of agreeable listening.	7.716515948215559
7278. if your favorite song	is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.	12.352652989178642
7279. the london label offers	an operatic recital by ettore bastianini a baritone whose fame	is international.	5.951200072990856
7280. murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry	street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons	in the premiere of his latest work signal and the repetition	of an earlier one journal.	7.661221759365643
7281. signal is choreographed	for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais.	6.206805292603436
7282. its abstract decor is by john hultberg.	10.646172525857638
7283. program note reads	as follows:   take hands h this urgent visage beckons us.	4.717034520859852
7284. here as in journal mr louis has given himself	the lion's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is	capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting	physical movements.	11.166925712439006
7285. indeed both journal and signal	qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.	6.084327235918729
7286. but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and	it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.	11.808713237207566
7287. one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations	could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is	too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.	7.223577746518179
7288. it may be of course that mr louis is consciously trying to create	works that anticipate an age of total automation.	14.024835343033681
7289. but it may be	also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics	at the present time.	8.866898133816681
7290. one thing is certain however and that is that	he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours	of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be.	9.887115369413056
7291. a brisk satirical spoof of contemporary	american mores entitled an american journey was given its	first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night	by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company.	4.703536995793582
7292. choreographed	by mr nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that	also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris' once	upon a time h as well as her women's song and	mr nagrin's indeterminate figure.	7.362630960044479
7293. eugene lester	assembled a witty and explicit score for an american journey	and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.	5.419245408140583
7294. mr nagrin has described four places each with its scenery	and people added two diversions and concluded with a	toccata for the young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation	of rock'n'roll dancing.	7.49594094556602
7295. the places could be anywhere	the idiosyncrasies	and foibles observed there could be anybody's and	the laugh is on us all.	5.92481253443715
7296. but we need not mind too much because mr	nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever	almost all the way.	10.809555757901473
7297. miss tamiris' once upon a time	h is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures	that bother them somehow.	7.132097259033734
7298. unfortunately the man and	woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the	menacing figures failed to make them any more so.	9.818892281505466
7299. nor did the dancing	involved really seize the attention at any time.	9.174699295056506
7300. the music here russell	smith's tetrameron sounded good.	9.499177663389338
7301. all the performances	of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company	with mr nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers seemed	to be fine shape.	5.837026533329727
7302. the symphony of the air greatly assisted by van cliburn	last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall	off to a good start.	7.531689438020374
7303. at the same time the orchestra announced that	next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie and	that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each	of them in five different communities.	7.50916970935943
7304. this news announced	by jerome toobin the orchestra's administrative director brought	applause from the 2800 persons who filled the hall.	7.245617571543734
7305. they showed they	were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there	so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln	center of the new york philharmonic the philadelphia orchestra	and the boston symphony.	7.058424726086823
7306. this season the orchestra has already	taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription	concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county	center in white plains.	9.783245588342677
7307. the details of the suburban concerts	next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced	later mr toobin said.	8.777282220809555
7308. the concertos that van	cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return	from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky the rachmaninoff	third and the prokofieff third.	9.391862278737259
7309. it was pleasant last night therefore	to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded	the emperor.	7.396241517942889
7310. the young texas pianist can make	great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities	of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.	9.548231507561377
7311. but they	were not what distinguished his performance.	9.750861514256938
7312. the elements that did	were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the	third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger	moments of the opening movement and the final rondo.	8.889989229854493
7313. mr	cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne.	10.44833302301935
7314. alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that	he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of	broodinf poetic mystery.	9.813678671512617
7315. the collaboration was remarkable as it was	in both the other movements too.	7.2989389286147075
7316. mr wallenstein who	will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the leonore	overture no 3 and the fourth symphony.	10.031296905331653
7317. the orchestra	was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively.	7.44892226360584
7318. and although	there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at	its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed	tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven.	10.379023947472914
7319. igor oistrakh	will be the next soloist on feb 4.	6.735030487064344
7320. there are times when one suspects that the songs that are	dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be	better than many of those that are left in.	10.393224657030917
7321. today in the era of the	integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all	development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter	how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does	not perform the function required of it.	6.424913637361352
7322. in the more casually	constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties	there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song	of merit.	11.642678808589462
7323. yet there is the classic case of the gershwins' the	man i love.	9.756750321875412
7324. deemed too static when it was first heard in lady	be good in philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score.	10.190638833485709
7325. it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version	of strike up the band and again abandoned shortly before the	entire show was given up.	9.372306904038345
7326. it finally reached broadway in the second	and successful version of strike up the band in 1929.	12.308880471653849
7327. another song in strike up the band- i've got a crush	like the gershwins richard rodgers and	lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them.	5.3367634968708355
7328. if one	of mr rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than	interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure mr hart	was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance	in another show.	8.267876860480786
7329. several of these double entries have been	collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney along with rodgers	and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york	and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly	heard rodgers and hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing	album	.	6.19498994509691
7330. among the particular gems in this collection	is the impudent opening song of the garrick gaieties	an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from	rodgers and hart in the years that followed; dorothy loudon's	raucous listing of the attractions at the roxy music hall from	i married an angel; and the incisive style with which charlotte	rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of i blush	a song that was cut from a connecticut yankee.	6.41145082272459
7331. altogether	fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by	a quintet of able vocalists.	5.996715443899546
7332. norman paris has provided them with extremely	effective orchestral accompanimen   turning to the current	musical season on broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals		has been transferred to an original cast album	that has some entertaining	moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited	by the show might lead one to expect.	7.605855570254134
7333. robert morse singing with comically	plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible	for the high spots in frank loesser's score.	6.9626429088384105
7334. rudy	vallee who shares star billing with mr morse makes only two	appearances.	9.097787876133687
7335. he shares with mr morse a parody of the college anthems	he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia	martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice.	6.917170633628058
7336. in general mr loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist	than he has as composer.	11.668434904364554
7337. like mr loesser jerry herman	is both composer and lyriist for	c	but in this	case it is the music that stands above the lyrics.	6.466440290811163
7338. for this story of	an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel mr herman	has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles.	9.104530965861892
7339. there are the full-bodied resourceful	voices of robert weede mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the	most of mr herman's lilting melodies and for an occasional	change of pace the bright humor of molly picon.	5.5100566453157285
7340. mr herman has	managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american	ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both	idioms.	9.774643166055602
7341. not content to create only the music and lyrics noe^l	coward also wrote the book and directed	a saga of life on a	cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr coward's more	memorable works.	6.587994821648398
7342. the melodies flow along pleasantly as mr coward's	songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut-to-a-familiar-pattern	quality.	7.806576822795262
7343. elaine stritch who sings with a persuasively	warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other	members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr coward's songs.	6.01987904003613
7344. with three fine russian films in recent months on world	war 2- the house i live in the cranes are flying	and ballad of a soldier- we had every right to expect	a real soviet block-buster in the day the war ended.	6.988567509597714
7345. it	simply isn't not by a long shot.	4.931406415267112
7346. the artkino presentation with english	titles opened on saturday at the cameo theatre.	10.077133093744722
7347. make no mistake this gorky studio drama is a respectable import-	aptly grave carefully	written performed and directed.	5.454650483283758
7348. in describing the initial allied	occupation of a middle-sized german city the picture has color pictorial	pull and genuinely moving moments.	7.9129855249865235
7349. told strictly from the viewpoint	of the russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over	the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple at both sides of the conflict's	aftermath.	5.950877494420873
7350. unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this	romance at the expense of everything else.	11.107124534879086
7351. tenderly and rather tediously	the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse	and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they	don't want to hurt.	5.456763610495428
7352. it's the old story war or no war and more	than one viewer may recall hollywood's titanic several seasons	back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of	a society dilettante.	4.528255212426549
7353. not that the picture is superficial.	15.571621044948856
7354. under	yakov segal's direction it begins stirringly as crouching soviet	and nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first	surrender gesture.	6.475497035327288
7355. one high-up camera shot is magnificent as the germans	straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square	and drop their weapons.	5.284997421874098
7356. only	once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic	sense of sharing a rare experience.	9.41738935455222
7357. ring of bright water by	gavin maxwell is just that- a haunting warmly personal chronicle	of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands.	4.9990499570811835
7358. he has married me with h a ring of bright	water	begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title	and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the	author conveys.	8.587067220691196
7359. the place is camusfearna the site of a long-vanished	sea-village opposite the isle of skye.	7.072473908589828
7360. it is a land of long fjords	few people a single-lane road miles away- and of wild stags greylag	geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters.	7.905999015332193
7361. how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna his furnishing	the empty house with beach-drift the subtle changes in season over	ten years is a moving experience.	5.58858298970452
7362. just the evocations of time and	place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today	seems almost lost would be enough.	9.73565227031331
7363. there	is mijbil an otter who travelled with maxwell- and gave maxwell's	name to a new species- from the tigris marshes to his london	flat.	4.15125179280393
7364. it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more	engaging animal in all literature.	15.534887114737348
7365. this is not only a compliment to	mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings	in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened	otter cub's journey by plane from iraq to london then by train	to camusfearna with affectionate detail.	6.791764966280025
7366. mij as his owner	was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits.	8.790231621810484
7367. he liked to nip	ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth.	7.696997928652692
7368. he preferred	sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow.	14.061896474642957
7369. systematically he	would open and ransack drawers.	6.952036530943066
7370. given a small ball or marbles he would	invent games and play by himself for hours.	9.467727390282098
7371. with curiosity and elan	he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself	for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting	with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell who nearly lost his life	in doing so.	4.87040914930551
7372. a year and a day of this idyll is described for the	reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality	is charted but self-discovery as well.	10.950142029739757
7373. in the solitude of camusfearna	there had been no loneliness.	9.916818752343225
7374. to be quite alone where there	are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some	pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness h	a sharpening of the senses.	7.618811687901556
7375. now with the increasing interdependence	between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need	that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.	6.855194821173356
7376. two other people	in time shared mijbil's love: h it remained around us three	that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable	world of wave and water h; we were his trinity and he behaved	towards us h with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation.	7.045146136656421
7377. in turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his	worship.	9.551521087998063
7378. the brief details of mijbil's	death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy.	8.59563393239163
7379. man to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible	in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract	symbol of the savage in man.	6.3604854122195675
7380. but then through a strange coincidence	maxwell manages to acquire idal a female otter and the fascinating	story starts once more.	9.297945593089402
7381. one is not sure who emerges as	the main personality of this book- mijbil with his rollicking ways	or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller	and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an	unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid	and unabashed.	5.899157852148139
7382. this reviewer read the book when it was first brought	out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement.	13.403707031368223
7383. now gavin	maxwell's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world.	6.116624148573697
7384. the performances of the comedie francaise are the	most important recent events in the new york theater.	12.262964014298438
7385. they	serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats	as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that	prevailed in the 17th century.	6.721335938647602
7386. on the contrary the old plays are continually	being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has	only a brief history at the comedie.	9.690985838609217
7387. of course the well-received	revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds	us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism.	8.072897435778431
7388. the directors of	the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient	a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this	season closed their plays after one performance.	8.241296100481128
7389. but they are aware	of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full	houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic	classic.	7.131963283211937
7390. in france novel approaches to the classic french	plays are frequently attempted.	11.829784675239175
7391. the government pays a subsidy	for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who	sometimes put moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve	interesting results.	5.890514310265451
7392. so far as i know the comedie has never	put moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century but	they do reinterpret plays and characters.	11.155934908060877
7393. last season the comedie's	two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can	expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine's phedre	and moliere's school for wives.	4.604607206377327
7394. the new	phedre was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient greek;	perhaps that is the comedie's equivalent for thrusting this	play's characters into our own time.	6.430007852013022
7395. the speaking of the lines seemed	excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the	spirit of 17th century elegance.	8.041642294122743
7396. a few literary men defended what they	took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but	the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.	9.388900728297028
7397. the new school	for wives was interpreted according to a principle that	is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy- the	idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.	5.77137023524078
7398. among the moliere specialists of some years ago louis	jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while fernand ledoux	often performing at the comedie made them more gross than moliere may	have intended.	10.109668297214478
7399. apparently jouvet and ledoux attempted just	these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in the school	for wives.	6.607466648804293
7400. i say apparently although i saw jouvet as	arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death; by	that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments	of the comedy.	9.964009245307501
7401. arnolphe it will be recalled is a man	of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be.	7.181043184534415
7402. the part can lend itself to serious treatment; one influential	french critic remarked: pity for arnolphe comes with age.	7.273258152006913
7403. accordingly at the comedie last year jean meyer played	a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into	a tragedy.	6.479513521472542
7404. but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the	play became only comedy acted rather slowly.	9.957493299151768
7405. wisely the comedie	has brought moliere's tartuffe on its tour and has left	the school for wives at home.	5.581186891301448
7406. tartuffe is the religious hypocrite	who courts his benefactor's wife.	7.694592229739327
7407. jouvet played him as a sincere	zealot and ledoux at the comedie made him a gross buffoon or	so the historians tell us.	6.94644361168515
7408. louis seigner who formerly played	the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux is the tartuffe of the present	production which he himself directed.	7.93957145013036
7409. his tartuffe observes the	golden mean.	7.876971692099422
7410. his red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares	bespeak his sensuality.	8.430252120372309
7411. but his heavenward glances and his pious	speeches are not merely perfunctory; of course they do not reflect	sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his	pious impersonation.	7.1189134356083414
7412. occasionally seigner draws some justly	deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another.	7.9850564580588435
7413. the	whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone	who has seen seigner in his other parts.	7.323085932187933
7414. his normal specialty is playing	the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never	mean or sly.	6.347448540253707
7415. here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of	meanness and slyness.	7.748037125779958
7416. seigner is the dean of the company the	oldest actor in point of continuous service.	13.654489772000161
7417. in that function he helps	to rebut another legend about the comedie.	8.497903040168849
7418. we are often told that	the comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who	are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but	probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage.	7.29400337202674
7419. seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the	company; among his other parts are the leads in the bourgeois	gentleman and the imaginary invalid.	6.544653029954329
7420. in moliere's	farce the tricks of scapin robert hirsch undertakes	another of the great roles.	8.43389935880117
7421. here some innovation is attempted.	10.51512416720841
7422. to begin with scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever	servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master.	9.999031381373637
7423. hirsch's	scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical	agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he	serves.	4.884867771680789
7424. hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities	he has observed in the city toughs of the real world.	12.868287215409936
7425. and surely	his scapin has a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seems to	make him his own master and nobody's servant.	5.254370236268026
7426. django reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy was a true artist	one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and	flow into many channels.	7.297070211578792
7427. there is hardly a jazz guitarist in	the business today who doesn't owe something to django.	7.650550914883923
7428. and django	owed much to louis armstrong.	12.7994142573037
7429. he told once of how he switched his	style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records	he bought in the flea market in paris.	6.93364986562139
7430. it was the first jazz he	had heard.	23.33824602369877
7431. django who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in	belgium and who died in 1953 in france was an extraordinary man.	6.541581576609906
7432. most	of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep	with a cigarette.	9.72930154214274
7433. and this was before he began to play his startlingly	beautiful jazz.	11.559597837009484
7434. you can catch up with him- if you haven't	already- on rca-victor's album.	7.962598631783983
7435. djangology made	up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of	the hot club of france.	5.588398706276023
7436. this is a choice item and grappely deserves	mention too of course.	13.831517262059691
7437. he is one of the few men in history who	plays jazz on a violin.	12.336417091415207
7438. they play: minor swing honeysuckle	rose beyond the sea bricktop heavy	artillery djangology after you've gone where	are you my love?	5.831432127908763
7439.  i saw stars lover man	menilmontant and swing 42.	8.986785949543286
7440. all this is great	proceedings- get the minutes.	12.987493038284477
7441. kid ory the trombonist chicken	farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz.	6.8832161526647715
7442. he dates	back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans.	11.984813199016623
7443. his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years	than he cares to remember.	6.54340191119993
7444. good time jazz has released a nice	two-record album which he made.	8.253100938144009
7445. he is starred against alvin alcorn	trumpet; phil gomez clarinet; cedric haywood piano; julian	davidson guitar; wellman braud bass and minor hall drums.	3.8988216485239775
7446. the set contains high society do what ory	say down home rag careless love jazz me blues	weary blues original dixieland one-step bourbon	street parade panama toot toot tootsie	oh didn't he ramble beale street blues maryland	my maryland 1919 rag eh la bas mood	indigo and bugle call rag.	5.344084180539231
7447. all this will serve	to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those	who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late	to lay hands on the gems.	7.090575759345061
7448. mischa elman shared last night's lewisohn stadium concert	with three american composers.	6.39903607366109
7449. his portion of the program-	and a big portion it was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century	concertos for the violin: to wit the mendelssohn and the	tchaikovsky.	4.162902607449093
7450. that is an evening of music-making that would faze many	a younger man; mr elman is 70 years old.	7.270126295275182
7451. there were	8000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they	heard elman.	9.222794025096272
7452. but with all due respects and allowances it must	truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet	more mannered than musical.	10.343638038002346
7453. the occasion was sentimental; so was the	playing.	7.129379999995256
7454. the american part of the evening consisted of paul	creston's dance overture william schuman's chester	from new england triptych and two works of wallingford riegger	dance rhythms	op 58 and a romanza for strings op	56a.	7.061237688485337
7455. the creston is purely a potboiler with spanish english	french and american dances mixed into the stew.	6.465022232114738
7456. the riegger	with its latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale;	like his sweet attractive romanza it belongs to what the composer	called his non-dissonant category of works.	7.128138592659469
7457. the schuman	chester takes off from an old william billings tune with	rousing woodwind and brass effect.	6.128158046005866
7458. all these- potboilers	or no- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively	colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors.	8.18465709346395
7459. it	was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change.	5.942296094850489
7460. we have	alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well	as the lively performances of the stadium symphony.	9.370054640364966
7461. a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the	wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of a question of adultery	yesterday's new british import at the apollo.	6.400402733522173
7462. since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation	that would often arise the film's extensive discussion of the	problem seems at best superfluous.	9.39649899237312
7463. in its present artless low-budget	form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.	6.8613612823981125
7464. with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced	sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive.	8.168906714127987
7465. the explanation	offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage	to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile	accident.	7.331977857011071
7466. anthony steel as the husband is a jealous type	who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action	adulterous.	7.954769744584996
7467. the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction	of don chaffey as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father	and anton diffring as an innocent bystander.	5.782246191066509
7468. after a protracted	hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language	than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one's surprise	leaves the legal question unresolved.	7.362672569728125
7469. when the husband drops the case	and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in	the first place.	7.666208808897002
7470. for its final change of bill in its london season	the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one	of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the	royal opera house covent garden.	8.22760141048053
7471. no doubt the underlying idea	was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished	its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased.	7.6331311348151765
7472. and please it did in every sense of the word for it had	the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical	of london audiences.	14.362465043805605
7473. at the end of the program indeed there was a	demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes and nothing could stop	it.	9.075265479224544
7474. alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic	technical bit from the closing number taras bulba but even	then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined	not to go home at all.	8.100135471188914
7475. only a plea from the house manager john collins	finally broke up the party.	9.88338321514655
7476. but for all the manifest	intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for	instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level	it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.	13.568608808524084
7477. the taras bulba excerpt is a rousing version of	gogol's ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music	of soloviev-sedoi.	4.755951854059375
7478. it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women	and it contains everything in the books- lusty comedy gregarious	cavorting and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt	to make the human body perform.	8.302882526558209
7479. yuri soloviev oleg sokolov alexei	zhitkov lev sokolov yuri korneyev and mr livshitz were the	chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent.	5.060823705287704
7480. at	the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus	ballet bayaderka which opened the evening.	6.323579837462886
7481. what	a man this petipa was! and why do we in the west know so few of	his ballets?	6.1019828470332245
7482.  this scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn	hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily	beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human-	which of course is altogether fitting.	6.683724212948866
7483. the ensemble enters	in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness	and adagio is the general medium of the piece.	6.84952078287895
7484. its	ballerina olga moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and	ludmilla alexeyeva inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make	up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments.	6.188257354671362
7485. sergei vikulov as the	lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the	work is designed to belong to the ladies.	6.6640411408160505
7486. the middle section	of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal	merit but all of them pretty good at that.	12.57742915747091
7487. they consisted of a new	arrangement of nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by irina	kolpakova and mr sokolev with a large ensemble; a winning	little snow maiden variation by the adorable galina kekisheva;	two of those poetic adagios in greek veils	by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna	zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other; an amusing character	pas de cinq called gossiping women; a stirring flames	of paris pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky	and a lovely version of fokine's le cygne by olga	moiseyeva which had to be repeated.	3.9310015048200357
7488. vadim kalentiev was the	conductor.	10.232996538570879
7489. it was quite an evening!	a year ago today when the democrats were fretting and frolicking	in los angeles and john f kennedy was still only an	able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility	of the presidency theodore h white had already compiled masses	of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960.	6.443916575418916
7490. as the	pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated mr	white took more notes.	9.095846859923046
7491. he traveled alternately with mr kennedy	and with richard m nixon.	8.145283515046671
7492. he asked intimate questions	and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates'	in-groups.	14.541926946877059
7493. he assembled quantities of facts about the nature	of american politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course	of the closest presidential election in american history.	6.530204333680608
7494. those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about	that election; how little we know of what there is to be known is	made humiliatingly clear by mr white in the making of the president	1960.	12.123217251467311
7495. this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly	interesting one.	11.814125145992044
7496. what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism	turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history.	11.391801984959917
7497. mr	white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter.	7.53083489146587
7498. his	zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere	his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the	effectiveness of his book.	7.1004747994529405
7499. as a dramatic	narrative the making of the president 1960 is continuously	engrossing.	14.85500519436363
7500. and as an introduction to american politics it is highly	educational.	18.651263231512242
7501. the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr	kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns.	6.895681441032476
7502. he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential	hopefuls: five democrats- senator hubert h humphrey	senator stuart symington senator lyndon b johnson adlai	e stevenson and mr kennedy- and two republicans- governor	rockefeller and mr nixon.	6.040956588857216
7503. then in chronological	order mr white covers the primary campaigns the conventions and	the presidential campaign itself.	6.973111065446471
7504. in the process he writes at length	about many related matters: the importance of race religion local	tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television.	9.757502054018357
7505. mr white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions.	8.544056616881644
7506. he frequently	cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's	mouth from numerous insiders and from mr kennedy himself; but	never from mr nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and	distrust.	6.712554535146341
7507. rarely in american history has there been a political	campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less	says mr white.	6.004796581800546
7508. mr nixon he believes has no particular political	philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign.	9.26414449071912
7509. although a skillful	politician and a courageous and honest man mr nixon mr white	believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort	in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and	damaged his chances on television.	5.114609681400255
7510. mr nixon is a broody	moody man given to long stretches of introspection; he trusts only	himself and his wife.	7.871602644283831
7511. h he is a man of major talent- but a man	of solitary uncertain impulses.	7.96922037708965
7512. h he was above all a friend seeker	almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked.	10.0954657888522
7513. he wanted to identify	with people and have a connection with them; h the least inspiring	candidate since alfred m landon.	7.33795227724281
7514. mr kennedy	mr white believes had mastered politics on so many different	levels that no other	american could match him.	8.152343606507829
7515. calm dignified composed	superbly eloquent mr kennedy always knew everything	about everybody.	5.7990922975771815
7516. he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous	volunteers.	11.529192117349485
7517. every decision was made quickly on sound grounds.	8.899118981216427
7518. efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance.	10.163276720318075
7519. mr kennedy	did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.	6.999894724582758
7520. mr white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a	democrat himself who expects mr kennedy to be a fine president.	11.417199086890529
7521. throughout the making of a president	mr white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on	candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and	illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play	key roles.	6.3008155885997645
7522. and he makes many interesting comments.	15.962954288217043
7523. here are several:	the root question in american politics is always:	who's the man to see?	6.2148223706542325
7524.  to understand american politics is simply	to know people to know the relative weight of names- who are	heroes who are straw men who controls who does not.	8.606497351587127
7525. but to operate	in american politics one must go a step further- one must build a	bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection.	6.6122287025748765
7526. in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform	nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose	beyond expressing emotion.	11.40383241440937
7527. all platforms are meaningless:	the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience	of the candidate the party chooses to lead it.	6.132170681163982
7528. nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium which had begun with	the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night	continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an	evening of french operatic excerpts.	7.83940080317407
7529. miss pons is certainly	not	70-no singer ever is- and yet the rewards of the evening again	lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in	present accomplishments.	5.5715383378747765
7530. the better part of gallantry might be perhaps	to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown	and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which	she had chosen to sing.	7.522145823299107
7531. no orchestra however could be expected	to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as	miss pons encountered last night.	6.262239806574533
7532. in all fairness there were flashes	of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate	vocalism.	11.498173192064606
7533. one such moment came in the breathtaking way	miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer's shadow song.	6.917115727268118
7534. the years suddenly fell away at this point.	12.545169441221411
7535. on the whole however one	must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch	her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.	8.46525195668247
7536. sharing	the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau	making his stadium debut on this occasion.	6.696323336988329
7537. mr verreau began shakily	with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed	beyond middle volume.	6.1324918915798285
7538. later on this problem vanished and the flower	song from bizet's carmen was beautifully and intelligently	projected.	8.136093006470324
7539. radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach	the minority listener.	6.789458453043341
7540. lower costs and a larger number of stations	are the key factors making such specialization possible.	9.165049643873594
7541. the	mushrooming of fm outlets offering concerts	lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had	a fair amount of publicity.	5.620952446133958
7542. not so well known is the growth	of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners-	an audience which in the united states comprises some 19000000	people with $20000000000 to spend each year.	8.198719869946178
7543. of course	the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching.	9.682716057538986
7544. he even	buys a lot of the products he sees advertised- despite the fact that	the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any	but white models in commercials.	9.276820715383145
7545. but the growing number of	negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support	of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they	approach new prospects.	5.763582940507319
7546. it is estimated that more than 600 stations	do a significant amount of programing for the	negro.	16.49487887401739
7547. at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this	audience in about half of the 50 states.	10.587185706523234
7548. these and other figures	and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor	magazine a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers.	9.552714729874625
7549. for	10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics	of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching	this market through radio.	7.013168623620699
7550. in the past 10 years sponsor	observes these trends have become apparent:  negro population	in the us has increased 25 per cent while the white population	was growing by 18 per cent.	9.829483807165314
7551. the forgotten 15 million- as	sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey- has become	a better-remembered 19 million.	4.827452198709912
7552. advertisers are changing their	attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways	of speaking to it.	11.045729444994226
7553. stations programing to negro listeners	are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational	economic and cultural levels.	6.400118127776419
7554. futhermore the station which	wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement	projects not simply serve on the air.	7.951317123706908
7555. in the last decade	the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15	per cent and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per	cent according to a research man quoted by sponsor.	6.090514766721821
7556. a year	ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which	the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business.	7.988975641741759
7557. the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population	growth.	9.53485075163946
7558. it also brought home proof of something a casual observer	might have missed: that more than half of the us negroes live	outside the southeastern states.	11.917616516898917
7559. also the state with the largest	number of negroes is new york- not in the south at all.	8.264899644014326
7560. in new york city wlib boasts more community service programs	than any other negro station and one of the largest negro	news staffs in america.	11.881196592406996
7561. and wwrl's colorful mobile unit	cruising predominately negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder	of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.	4.340454005722851
7562. recently wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases	of employment agency deceit.	8.202889903609554
7563. a half-dozen other stations in the new	york area also bid for attention of the city's negro population	up about 50 per cent in the past decade.	5.367106646740126
7564. in all big cities outside	the south and even in small towns within the south radio stations	can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners.	10.38112752426807
7565. the keystone broadcasting system's negro network includes	360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total	us negro population.	5.8091784864456395
7566. one question which inevitably	crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the	negro is moving into a fully integrated status.	10.5290901258701
7567. whatever the	long-range impact of integration the owners of negro-appeal radio stations	these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal.	6.444294115637387
7568. advertisers	have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names	they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.	8.538863605496177
7569. and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro	disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only	from a fact sheet.	7.429157992919357
7570. what sets negro-appeal programing apart from	other radio shows?	8.11630877032569
7571.  sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular	negro bands and singers; rhythm-and-blues mood music; race	music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs.	4.313227049837511
7572. furthermore news	and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects	and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station.	6.93993171910104
7573. advertising	copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro	concern.	6.888627037941339
7574. sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony	station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious	of quality and and does not wish to be associated with radio	which is any way degrading to his race; he tends to shy away from the	hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio	programs famous.	7.460659045145025
7575. the sociological impact is perhaps most	eloquently summed up in this quotation of j walter carroll of ksan	san francisco:   negro-appeal radio is more important	to the negro today because it provides a direct and powerful	mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements	and desires.	5.384990450077417
7576. it will continue to be important as a means of orientation	to the negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make	adjustment to the urban life.	15.355156423445155
7577. negro radio is vitally necessary during	the process of assimilation.	7.4547950132150405
7578. presentation of the life and times of john sloan in	the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human	values in art.	8.92968889092972
7579. staged by way of announcing the gift of a large	and intimate sloan collection by the artist's widow helen farr	sloan to the wilmington society of the fine arts the exhibition	presents a survey of sloan's work.	5.640380831587739
7580. from early family portraits	painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of	the fine arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed	in his last year and still part of his estate.	10.534393056721777
7581. few	artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they	lived.	7.683152190360354
7582. few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with	so little bitterness.	11.211689800188983
7583. the paintings drawings prints and illustrations	all reflect the manners costumes and mores of america in the first	half of the present century.	7.087099079639681
7584. obviously sloan's early years	were influenced by his close friend robert henri.	7.453261855008646
7585. as early as	1928 however the sloan style began to change.	9.285430446965664
7586. the dark pigments of	the early work were superseded by a brighter palette.	9.73769212364757
7587. the solidity of	brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual	abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies	and studio nudes.	6.103082079425169
7588. the exhibition presents all phases of sloan's	many-sided art.	11.477350066293246
7589. in addition to the paintings are drawings prints	and illustrations.	14.741584566199132
7590. sloan created such works for newspaper supplements	before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the	streets of new york thereby building for america an incomparable	city survey from paintings of mcsorley's saloon to breezy clotheslines	on city roofs.	7.397408736548739
7591. one of the most appealing of the rooftop	canvases is sun and wind on the roof with a woman and child	bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds.	8.578613953055543
7592. although	there are landscapes in the show	the human element was the compelling	factor in sloan's art.	7.655616378225428
7593. significant are such canvases as	bleeker street saturday night with its typically american	crowd; the multifigure traveling carnival	in which action is vivified by lighting; or carmine	theater 1912 the only canvas with an ash can	although sloan was a member of the famous eight and of the	so-called ash-can school a term he resented.	4.741177193151396
7594. not all	the paintings however are of cities.	12.320913212206452
7595. the exhibition touches briefly	on his sojourn in the southwest	indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western	.	7.330721403311003
7596. the fact that sloan was an extrovert	concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his	art as a human chronicle.	13.160990792323236
7597. there are 151 items in the wilmington	show including one painting by each member of the eight	as well as work by sloan's friends and students.	7.459976542737584
7598. supplementing the	actual art are memorabilia- correspondence diaries books from the	artist's library etc.	5.451131878940528
7599. all belong to the collection being given	to wilmington over a period of years by mrs sloan who has cherished	such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at	the art students league new york in the 1920's.	6.62816737356563
7600. to	enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries the delaware	art center will maintain	a complete file of photographs of all sloan works as well as	a card index file.	7.822289594596478
7601. the entire sloan collection will be made available	at the center to all serious art students and historians.	8.353671817722853
7602. the	current exhibition which remains on view through oct 29 has tapped	14 major collections and many private sources.	8.078016277526283
7603. any musician playing beethoven here where beethoven was born	is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care.	5.987299973931049
7604. in	a sense he is offering bonn what its famous son	never did- the sound of the composer's mature style.	6.802578762944888
7605. robert	riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded	23rd beethoven festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the	style.	6.719237201255791
7606. his readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative	without being presumptuous.	8.884269659778285
7607. the 32 c minor variations	with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another	leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.	6.49354869011623
7608. the d minor sonata op 31 no 2 introduced by dynamically	shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative-	single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way	toward the idea to come.	8.077139984974403
7609. these inwardly dramatic moments showed the	kind of opera style of which beethoven was genuinely capable	but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.	6.384605146040857
7610. two late sonatas op 110 and 111 were played with similar insight	the disarming simplicities of the op 111 adagio made plain without	ever becoming obvious.	6.93725760922035
7611. the two were separated from each other by	the six bagatelles of op 126.	7.8705471988417575
7612. herr riefling in everything he	gave his large beethoven hall audience proved himself as an interpreter	of unobtrusive authority.	8.150370831270319
7613. volker wangenheim who conducted	bonn's sta^dtisches	orchester on the following evening made	one more conscious of the process of interpretation.	5.553083593019935
7614. herr wangenheim	has only recently become the city's music director and is a young	man with a clear flair for the podium.	6.854194323060323
7615. but he weighted the eighth	symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed	considerably at odds with the music.	7.663907124604851
7616. he might have been hoping to all	appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction	with the choral fantasy at the end of the program could amount	to something like the ninth; but no amount of head-tossing could	make it so.	9.501550410335776
7617. the conductor's preoccupation with the business	of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first	orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto but when he put	his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed	it did so with plenty of spring.	6.050617028759585
7618. the concerto's soloist	hans richter-haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though	without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on	the previous evening by herr riefling.	6.7112223424066055
7619. his was a burgomaster's	beethoven solid and sensible.	5.948479367042704
7620. everybody returned after intermission	for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano chorus	and orchestra in c minor made up by its composer to fill	out one of his programs.	7.924894698361885
7621. the entrance of the sta^dtisches gesangverein	was worth all the waiting however as the	young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.	7.3344165732152575
7622. the	last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most	compositional categories brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester	and rundfunkchor to bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance	of the missa solemnis.	5.995134023657788
7623. a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray	resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood	on the shell of a great tortoise.	6.607001794870853
7624. this theory eventually proved inexact.	14.984761099428423
7625. but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known	bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.	9.031023537821474
7626. it is the business of cosmologists the scientists who	study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great	cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors.	12.290978632881185
7627. these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy	principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain	phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge.	6.65017654991931
7628. in	the autumn of 1959 the british broadcasting corporation presented	a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology.	8.181974067955997
7629. three	of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other	acted as a moderator.	6.828029139855866
7630. the participants were professor h bondi	professor of mathematics at king's college london; dr w	b bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college	london; dr r a lyttleton a lecturer at st john's	college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the	university of cambridge; and dr g j whitrow reader	in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology	london.	5.676756617951268
7631. dr whitrow functioned as moderator.	8.68257491245581
7632. the	programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments	have been published in a totally engrossing little book called rival	theories of cosmology.	8.23301498851955
7633. dr bonnor begins with	a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on	the general theory of relativity.	7.532408823897036
7634. first of all and this has been calculated	by observation the universe is expanding- that is the galaxies	are receding from each other at immense speeds.	10.508599623194776
7635. because of this	dr bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated	by stars and whatever else is there.	8.744246489088969
7636. this expansion has been going	on for an estimated eight billion years.	10.733649384974553
7637. dr bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts	that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and	reverse itself and that the contraction will set in.	7.105454331721512
7638. then after many	more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a	common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again.	9.704389896938858
7639. professor bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory.	6.631310470376089
7640. he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually	being created in space.	8.574290037510266
7641. for this reason he says the density	of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are	zooming away in all directions.	9.857037284999139
7642. new galaxies are forever being formed	to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.	10.263159615607922
7643. if this	is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years	ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe	is expanding.	9.235517377972407
7644. for new galaxies to be created professor bondi	declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be	created in an area the size of your living room once every few million	years.	10.634812999163222
7645. he contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on	which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because	some slight error must be assumed in such experiments.	5.773809861681148
7646. dr	lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe	and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons.	9.343204971671682
7647. protons	and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract	each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen-	the basic building block of matter.	6.158654152315964
7648. the charges of the electron	and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr	lyttleton is not so sure.	9.7669750400522
7649. suppose says dr lyttleton the proton	has a slightly greater charge than the electron	.	6.708010131336902
7650. this would give the hydrogen atom a slight	charge-excess.	15.050028510321539
7651. now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface	of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the	gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms	in the sphere.	7.143180110599957
7652. because electrical forces are far	more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot	away from the sphere.	9.515084742312895
7653. dr lyttleton then imagines the universe	as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from	it.	6.0595770005315
7654. this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the	universe.	15.199265120775541
7655. this slim book while giving the	reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the	universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has.	6.235964360622634
7656. several	photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with	the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors	were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost	every field.	7.529220973229994
7657. it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists	of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made	satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up	new vistas to science.	7.266991403046746
7658. presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet	rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.	5.578136333027867
7659. these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the	earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic	theories.	6.5110710387069535
7660. there would seem to be some small solace in	the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time	accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought	ladder from which to peer at alien regions.	11.352720004769422
7661. in doing away with	the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed	a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.	6.522145586543698
7662. and although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even	now be finding its match in the imagination of man.	10.462445265935862
7663. roots the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th	st	which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual	and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl.	6.7568782764257
7664. highly successful	in england before its transfer to new york most of roots is	as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are	gaudy.	8.23334191008171
7665. only in its final scene where beatie bryant	shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual	lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile	the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch	for most of the first two and one-half acts.	6.308695310554327
7666. the burden of mr	wesker's message is that people living close to the soil	are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people	city-bred intellectuals imagine.	7.618897439745018
7667. rather they are genuine clods proud	of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating	influences of aesthetics or thought.	6.290140761042121
7668. they care no more for politics	says mr wesker than they do for a symphony.	10.83271012348804
7669. seeming to have roots	in the soil they actually have none in life.	6.725495092255491
7670. they dwell in short	in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are	commonly reported to have lived.	9.695954759921017
7671. but this is a theme which does	not take so much time to state as mr wesker dedicates to it.	10.002042994420517
7672. so	much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest	of the theatergoer	.	8.69114723791941
7673. the messy meals the washing	of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such	a thing as redundancy.	6.993666340599901
7674. now for the good points.	19.20288021747077
7675. miss doyle	as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a	warm smile.	6.321496431554087
7676. she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has	become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie	and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating	including a dose of good british socialism.	9.503706541401694
7677. but while she	is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open	before her ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and	instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull	he sends beatie a letter of dismissal.	6.455184038626837
7678. beatie getting	no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she	has lost a lover she has gained her freedom.	7.739736735345022
7679. despite a too long sustained	declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see	why british audiences apparently were impressed by roots.	5.945677893548605
7680. there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including	william hansen's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic	father and katherine squire's vigorous characterization of a farm	mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter or anyone	else.	6.581196396666317
7681. but i am afraid mr wesker's meat and potatoes dish	isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences.	6.5170091429939765
7682. shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain	that disrupted wednesday night's much ado about nothing opening	the season of free theatre in central park.	7.384517461855923
7683. the new	york shakespeare festival which is using the wollman memorial skating	rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed	began bravely.	6.5236767918382
7684. joseph papp impassioned founder of the festival and	director of much ado had a vibrant colorful production under	way.	8.343311663624867
7685. using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with	shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture.	6.275733705875449
7686. the audience	filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto	the lawns outside the fence.	9.09608228931206
7687. the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick	so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised	chuckles.	6.389723996257722
7688. the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges also	familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of	writers' heads evoked laughter.	6.616522500641766
7689. the vivacity of the masquers'	party at leonato's palace with the spanish motif in the music and	dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon cast a spell of	delight.	5.544173501811047
7690. as much ado turned serious while the insipid	claudio rejected hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall.	9.946119732940378
7691. at	first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas	were opened.	7.9903126902539965
7692. but the rain came more heavily and men and women in	light summer clothes began to depart.	11.008903947850184
7693. the grieving hero and her father	leonato followed by the friar left the stage.	7.6169149129961164
7694. a voice on the	loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance	would resume in ten minutes.	9.6963627027959
7695. more than half the audience departed.	19.145794100981284
7696. some remained in the wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats	or with newspapers to cover their heads.	9.775059273077073
7697. others huddled under the trees	outside the fence.	7.864571553198843
7698. twenty minutes after the interruption although	it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth	act where it had been stopped.	13.150453250945153
7699. beatrice and	benedick took their places on the stage.	6.850378883289147
7700. in their	very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus	had foreseen this moment.	10.29606690795677
7701. said benedick: lady beatrice	have you wept all this while?	5.868956242627711
7702.    replied beatrice:	yea and i will weep a while longer.	7.916082636050679
7703. the heavens refused	to give up their weeping.	8.822075070650394
7704. the gallant company completed act 4	and got through part of act 5.	9.554113806101794
7705. but the final scenes could not	be played.	10.80623253087535
7706. if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour	are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort.	10.979566152128024
7707. the parks department has done an admirable	job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare.	7.0378019941584204
7708. one could	hardly blame newbold morris the parks commissioner for devoting	so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short	notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony	its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the	villains.	7.220643330616418
7709. eldon elder who designed the stage also created	a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background	and shakespeare's lighthearted mood.	5.016193694888316
7710. mr papp has directed a	performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious	business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style	would be preferable.	7.694519723774676
7711. elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at	hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints.	6.854306760715272
7712. still a demurrer or two must be entered.	11.44226014883224
7713. schwarzkopf is	of course schwarzkopf.	7.851655819202926
7714. for style and assurance for a supreme and	regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her.	10.864413248839584
7715. if the voice	is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful	instrument controlled and flexible.	8.784643506736703
7716. put to the service of lieder	of schubert brahms strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical	way it made its effect with ease and precision.	8.736449134829712
7717. but what has	been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism.	9.024668614425876
7718. instead	of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical	expression miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic	sin of artistic pride- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads	a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the	music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch	imposed from the outside.	6.830797723710001
7719. the symptoms saturday night were	unmistakable.	10.400356420662607
7720. clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little	too melodramatic.	7.492639615835131
7721. there was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh	there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in	the interest of effect.	7.999284887400317
7722. the result was like that of a beautiful painting	with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness.	14.955234037999402
7723. there were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes	the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication.	8.20270989605068
7724. miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist john wustman often achieved	the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition.	7.536792696756852
7725. all the more	reason why there should have been no place for the frills; miss	schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.	7.844329942649373
7726. the dance dancers and dance enthusiasts	had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night	than all had had two nights earlier when stadium concerts presented	the first of two dance programs.	9.22554251135105
7727. on saturday the orchestra	was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently	in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved.	9.282679775771403
7728. there was additionally a bonus for the saturday-night	patrons.	17.77458742729091
7729. alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first	new york performance of mr ailey's roots of the blues	a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival.	5.90455234977407
7730. otherwise the program included as on thursday the	taras-tchaikovsky design for strings the dollar-britten	divertimento the dollar-de banfield the duel and	the pas de deux from the nutcracker.	6.581682740729145
7731. maria tallchief	and erik bruhn who danced the nutcracker pas de deux were	also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from don quixote	another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.	5.3400895565457
7732. among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening	elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in	their roles in the duel a work that depends so much upon the	precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.	8.316797026816689
7733. mr	ailey's roots of the blues an earthy and very human modern	dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of	the evening.	5.7450169064794485
7734. as brother john sellers sang five blues	to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep	shepard mr ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile	dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and	ecstatic.	7.165587619378488
7735. their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm	fan.	7.006732176997737
7736. he wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive	in a yellow and orange dress.	9.704486789533675
7737. the cat-like sinuousness	and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and	slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes	almost frightening tensions.	5.479560034760264
7738. roots of the blues may	not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super-charged impact.	9.210691749789184
7739. perhaps it is better to stay at home.	13.052311851755755
7740. the armchair traveler	preserves his illusions.	12.175371758704376
7741. this somewhat cynical comment may	be found in blue skies brown studies a collection of travel	essays by william sansom who would never consider staying home for	long.	6.8843571537121
7742. mr sansom is english bearded formidably cultivated the	versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and	of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something	midway between.	7.58534609140002
7743. the only man alive who seems qualified by	his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance	of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell	mr sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration	worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of	a hungarian beauty and an american multimillionaire	.	5.793523134921747
7744. the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible	if taken in too thick slices.	12.859633976056978
7745. there are sixteen essays	in blue skies brown studies.	12.767093810231893
7746. most of them were written between	1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines.	13.503631479164978
7747. all	are well written and are overwritten.	7.815782877487132
7748. but even if mr sansom labors	too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from	his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can	charm and astound.	9.34997476285112
7749. too many books and articles are just assembled by	putting one word after another.	7.908737131352794
7750. mr sansom actually writes his	with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense	relish in all the metaphorical resources of english with a thick shower	of sophisticated cultural references.	7.771675504561279
7751. i like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells	and looks like its color its particular kind of life.	7.970850815257608
7752. this is	an exact description of what mr sansom does.	11.959219143046539
7753. he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches	an individual or quotes his opinions.	6.541156046152693
7754. it is an over-all impression	mr sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details	of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture	and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere	and of echoes of the past.	7.900276674763092
7755. william sansom writes only about	europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london	vienna the french riviera and the norwegian fjords.	6.534206353261152
7756. but no	matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original	mind and his own sensitive reactions.	9.579725624485041
7757. a writer lives at best in	a state of astonishment he says.	7.920143607538916
7758. beneath any feeling he has of	the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it	all.	10.50522293136286
7759. to transmit that feeling he writes.	9.6898165886857
7760. this may not be true of	many writers but it certainly is true of mr sansom.	14.97708529058302
7761. so in these	pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st torpetius	that still persists in st tropez; at the sun and the	heat of mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an englishman	than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas	city; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's	finest restaurants la bonne auberge which is situated on the seacoast	twenty miles west of the nice airport; and at the infinite variety	of london.	5.75476039010457
7762. mr sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular	way which recalls the statues of bernini	and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto.	8.481751295287268
7763. he can coin a neat phrase:	a street spattered with an invigoration of people; tulips	with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears; after a	snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity.	4.105468380479171
7764. and for	all his lacquered almost byzantine self-consciousness he can make	one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison.	7.018005079579825
7765. from afar	in one of his best essays mr sansom expresses	his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio	himself that dot the environs of vicenza.	6.878212842994189
7766. how far that pedimented	and pillared style has shed its influence mr sansom reminds	us thus:   the white colonnaded cedar-roofed southern mansion	is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england	to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south	the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza: the old mind of	andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair	on a southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise	firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light	and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns	framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple	of mating lips.	6.223152380656358
7767. nice even if a trifle gaudy.	8.514632722871672
7768. blue skies	brown studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs.	9.012260268445731
7769. in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over	the absence of original drama on television but not for years have	many regretted the passing of new plays on radio.	6.956859704971543
7770. wbai the listener-supported	outlet on the frequency-modulation band has decided	to do what it can to correct this aural void.	6.853201617241818
7771. yesterday it offered	poised for violence by jean reavey.	7.50481160851057
7772. wbai is on	the right track: in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis	on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre	as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue	to demonstrate.	8.060341615092163
7773. unfortunately poised for violence was not	the happiest vehicle with which to make the point.	7.9820704298688545
7774. mrs	reavey's work is written for the stage- it is mentioned for an off-broadway	production in the fall- and in addition employs an avant-garde	structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension	is to be encouraged.	5.866992368264225
7775. the play's device is to explore society's	obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group	of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting	rather than just be themselves.	4.5877090755266945
7776. in a succession of scenes they appear	in different guises- patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and	participants in a family picnic- but in each instance they inevitably	put ugliness before beauty.	6.988044127754795
7777. somewhere in mrs reavey's	play there is both protest and aspiration of merit.	6.122194138869034
7778. but its relentless	discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that	after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt.	9.438718601952342
7779. moreover	her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous	assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own	right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.	5.10767193717748
7780. but quite	conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the	work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve	the burden on the author's words.	8.498271005484028
7781. which in itself is an immediate	reward of the wbai experiment; good radio drama has its own	special demands that badly need reinvigoration.	5.487701831658785
7782. a weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere	archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music	is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.	7.701500033995682
7783. titled what's	new in music?	5.98764201487249
7784.  the enterprising program is heard saturday	afternoons on radio station wqxr.	10.623295406674258
7785. the brief notes	introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and	many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by	the hand through an often difficult maze.	5.694608986176133
7786. the show is programed and	written by the station's assistant continuity editor chuck briefer.	7.756868928224089
7787. the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings.	10.212684244384102
7788. last saturday's interesting melange included ernst toch	karlheinz stockhausen richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from	a new space opera by the swedish composer karl-birger blomdahl.	6.241560361543247
7789. other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american	composer a particular type of music or the music of a given	country.	6.843193903953747
7790. it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is	set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene.	12.841074563227703
7791. but	one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of	the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera that further opportunity	would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety	and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.	6.810890926808419
7792. the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square	garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before	it brings its long american tour to a close.	10.296026512214823
7793. it is not simply	giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york	engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers	that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's	heart.	8.947405627857655
7794. it is good to see those numbers again.	22.543191967861006
7795. the suite	of old russian dances that opened that inaugural program	with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into	typical moiseyev vigor and warmth; the amusing yurochka	in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance; the	lovely polyanka or the meadow;	the three moldavian dances entitled zhok; the sweet and funny	little dance about potato planting called bul'ba; and	the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called city	quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been	and they are welcome back.	4.455545025388989
7796. so for that matter are the newer	dances- the kalmuk dance with its animal movements that genial	juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called the platter the	rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called summer the	three shepherds of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs	and of course the trenchant rock 'n' roll.	6.573373252582058
7797. as autumn starts its annual sweep few americans and canadians realize	how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring.	5.158331467903305
7798. spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire	land surface of the earth.	10.72316536204862
7799. the only other regions so blessed are the	british isles western europe eastern china southern chile and	parts of japan new zealand and tasmania.	6.579772101378442
7800. their autumn tints are	all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson gold	purple bronze blue and vermilion that flame up in north america.	7.41639033418894
7801. jack frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle;	in fact a freezing autumn dulls the blaze.	5.624066948123237
7802. the best effects come	from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain	followed by sunny days and cool nights.	9.048113346771903

7839. though the subject- segregation	in her native south- has been thoroughly worked miss mccullers	uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm	franny	and zooey.	3.5208285437253233

7889. ago it was bruited that the primary character	in erich	maria remarque's new novel was based on the marquis alfonso	de portago the spanish nobleman who died driving in the mille miglia	automobile race of 1957.	5.673063328403205
7890. if this was in fact mr remarque's	intention he has achieved a notable failure.	11.276621252830056
7891. clerfayt of heaven	has no favorites resembles portago only in that he is male and	a race-driver- quite a bad race-driver whereas portago was a good	one.	5.186309429991014
7892. he is a dull unformed and aimless person; the twelfth marquis	de portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate.	8.459406462751666
7893. one	looked forward to mr remarque's ninth book if only because	not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile	racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised.	4.900228879888634
7894. unhappily	heaven has no favorites does not alter the record except to	add one more bad book to the list.	8.333274099989433
7895. mr remarque's conception	of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble.	5.646325879255096
7896. he proposed throwing	together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced	on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery.	9.066373877536417
7897. his	treatment of it is something else.	10.74616546354242
7898. his heroine chooses to die- the	price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being	higher than she wishes to pay.	7.2213367272389535
7899. her lover precedes her in death at	the wheel and presumably he too has chosen.	6.9083119313199814
7900. between the first meeting	of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement mr remarque	has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse some demure	and rather fetching love-making pleasant talk about some of the	countryside and restaurants of europe and a modicum of automobile racing.	6.464840795975415
7901. the ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing;	the love-making perhaps because it is pale and low-key when	one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is	often charming; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.	4.967927628238462
7902. this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and	it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author	drawn clerfayt as say a tournament golfer.	10.122198360976176
7903. hazards to life and	limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant.	6.638104788513485
7904. race-drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit	and since it was obviously mr remarque's intention to establish	automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have	expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques	but of mores and attitudes.	7.052706404201617
7905. the jacket biography describes	him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although	i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records	or the literature.	6.397844053460936
7906. perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal.	12.892130120964628
7907. the	book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary	for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities	of racing.	7.577903886353686
7908. the necessity is not clear to me and in any case	to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car	which or whom he calls giuseppe parked on the place vendome	sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around	him is not a liberty; it is an absurdity.	7.197363938869373
7909. but it is in the	matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of	the book that remarque's failure is plainest.	9.150630138948264
7910. clerfayt is neurotic	preoccupied and passive.	10.709193490315402
7911. to be human he believes is to seek one's	own destruction: the freudian death-wish cliche inevitably	cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers.	4.832341925353034
7912. in point of fact	the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy	technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the	passion they feel for the work by which they live.	9.527916988177818
7913. a clerfayt may moon	on about the face of death in the cockpit; a portago could say	as he did say to me if i die tomorrow still i have had twenty-eight	wonderful years; but i shan't die tomorrow; i'll live	to be 105.	5.0161776822097375
7914. clerfayt transported may think of the engine	driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood.	9.116461495496976
7915. the italian	master piero taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy	though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles	an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae.	5.212260259631717
7916. clerfayt	driving	sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell;	the briton stirling moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all	time believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related	to ballet.	6.198789383391786
7917. errors in technical terminology suggest that	the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything	mr remarque hoped to tell us.	4.915739862344186
7918. however my principal	objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers	pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine-masters	of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.	7.409178768227051
7919. is leaderless according to this book.	11.46280912715913
7920. in	contrast	the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev tito	and mao.	8.0056010956613
7921. against this invincible determination to communize the	whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals	and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common	good of all.	6.795134610629914
7922. it is field marshal montgomery's belief that	in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really	care about democracy or christianity; about 30 per cent call themselves	christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered	respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and	believers in democracy.	11.649758003259432
7923. but these western countries do care	about themselves.	10.672302217486667
7924. if say the russians	intended to stop tom jones' going to the pub then tom jones	would fight the commies.	7.840890158852234
7925. but he would fight for his own liberty rather	than for any abstract principle connected with it- such as cause.	6.7093091806962315
7926. for all practical purposes the west stands disunited undedicated	and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.	10.536253994872428
7927. with	this barrage montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the	blunderings of the west.	5.982406576185185
7928. never given to mincing words he places heavy	blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly	america.	8.606223723566682
7929. at war's end leadership in western europe passed	from britain because the labour government devoted its attention	to the creation of a welfare state.	7.059165706982734
7930. with britain looking inward overseas	problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united	states.	10.73786546018213
7931. montgomery believes that she started well.	9.6446411072141
7932. america	gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend	and foe alike.	9.65542424279685
7933. she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into	prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.	6.284425044948904
7934. america has divided more than she has united the west.	11.825519995507184
7935. the reasons	are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with	dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked.	7.27360137671519
7936. however she	really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by	a quality of leadership that is basically needed.	12.626158509772718
7937. but the greater	reason for fumbling stumbling american leadership is due to the	shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor.	7.118280668145194
7938. they are determined montgomery writes not to be surprised	again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not	only unnecessary but also creates nervousness h among other nations	in the western alliance- not to mention such great suspicions among	the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful	coexistence or disarmament is not possible.	8.365632986205933
7939. the net result	is that under american leadership the general world situation has	become bad.	7.507990448351786
7940. to monty the american people who in two previous	world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the	nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war.	10.45468647289399
7941. faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states	must be relied upon to lead.	6.6415837239129285
7942. the path to leadership is made clear.	14.05718989001707
7943. montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west's own	house in order.	6.398971894320928
7944. such a man must be able and willing to give clear and	sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations	will have absolute confidence.	15.823352904201204
7945. this leader must be a man who lives	above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of	the united states namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany	that the east german government does not exist that events in	japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired that the true government	of china is in formosa that mao was the evil influence behind	khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 and that	either china or russia wants or expects war.	5.990333429955705
7946. such a leader	must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity	about which it has always talked.	10.213801497384086
7947. after drastically overhauling nato	western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that	tear apart the east and west.	7.12184441230543
7948. major to this effort is to get all	world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970.	9.597124280296333
7949. the	west should make the central proposal; but the east would have	to show sincerity in carrying it out.	5.296859063399981
7950. but where is the	leader who will handle all these things for us?	11.879069208197093
7951.  montgomery knew	all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy.	10.418094955100019
7952. the man whom he	would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle.	10.726929206351764
7953. he alone	has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach	a decision.	8.064397267503148
7954. but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france's	lost soul.	11.80771990846142
7955. whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous	path to leadership.	6.730385322045456
7956. the leader montgomery envisages will need	to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life	allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans	to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency	and be honest and morally proper.	7.329323833332774
7957. all in all montgomery calls for a	leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.	7.989061145690764
7958. as far back as moses thence to cromwell	napoleon lincoln churchill and nehru montgomery attempts	to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men.	9.229471980420096
7959. he believes that	greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented	by churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history	as a political failure if it had not been for hitler's war.	7.302712848171479
7960. however montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory	and practice.	10.986942420673056
7961. most of what is said about his great men of history	has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary	scene.	10.113824971379502
7962. like eisenhower he holds the militarist's suspicion	of politicians.	9.042232518965669
7963. however at the same time montgomery selects as	his hero de gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions.	8.27977537213487
7964. monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement	and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support.	7.622665848586988
7965. for the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access	by the reader to his true thoughts.	8.085411988422026
7966. nevertheless montgomery	has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world.	10.640771165738874
7967. it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership.	10.079014621989488
7968. and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form	can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the	current shape of events.	13.029207296536057
7969. no common thing for a listener	to hear a singer live for the first time only after he	has died.	8.891527757258922
7970. but then mario lanza was no common singer and his whole	career public and non-public was studded with the kind of unconventional	happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital	only when he has ceased to be a living voice.	9.155062254627394
7971. it is a kind	of justice too that it should originate in london's royal albert	hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers	have entertained the thousands it will accommodate	.	7.652869484190256
7972. to be sure lanza made numerous concert	tours here and abroad but these did not take him to new york	where the carping critic might lurk.	10.422119540740379
7973. the reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving	public the	horse-playing public- all these and others fill substantial roles	in us life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating	public.	5.149986441844152
7974. the department of agriculture averaged out us	food consumption last year at 1488 lbs per person which allowing	for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry	every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow	down 8 lbs or more a day.	8.34596356026123
7975. that mother hen of the weight-height	tables the metropolitan life insurance co clucks that 48 million	americans are overweight.	5.686223342295696
7976. through previous centuries eating	changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just	getting enough.	7.94046159600829
7977. now big forces buffet food.	9.917881875620527
7978. for the first time in history	the us has produced a society in which less than one-tenth	of the people turn out so much food that the government's most	embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million	tons of surplus farm produce.	8.109645822412206
7979. in this same society the plain citizen	can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than	he can consume.	7.140486164223406
7980. refrigeration automated processing and packaging	conspire to defy season and banish spoilage.	7.843558993190803
7981. and in the wake of the new	affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american	interest in how what people eat affects their health.	8.175894495452164
7982. to eat is human	the nation is learning to think to survive divine.	10.735801433133568
7983. not all the concern for health is well directed.	10.731383893908758
7984. from the fusty	panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the us has progressed	to curds concentrates and capsules.	9.305628495240008
7985. each year reports the american	medical association ten million americans spend $900 million on	vitamins tonics and other food supplements.	5.983983627918047
7986. at juice bars in los	angeles' 35 health stores a new sensation is a pink high-protein	cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry-flavored	no-cal which sells for 59 per 8-oz glass.	5.486338045523063
7987. grocery stores	sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all.	6.115447555435832
7988. but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet	and health and a big group of us scientists wants to supply	them.	10.977558051729115
7989. the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university	of minnesota's physiologist ancel keys 57 inventor of the wartime	k ration and author of last year's bestselling	eat well and stay well.	6.119841511275111
7990. from his birch-paneled office in the	laboratory of physiological hygiene under the university's football	stadium in minneapolis	blocky grey-haired dr keys directs an ambitious $200000-a-year	experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations	and is still growing.	5.044523033052927
7991. pursuing it he has logged 500000 miles suffered	indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected	physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10000 individuals	from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini.	5.44006710841516
7992. he has measured	the skinfolds of neapolitan	firemen studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters analyzed	the mealie-meal eaten by capetown coloreds and experimented	on minneapolis businessmen.	6.669554533192986
7993. keys's findings	though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche.	5.705364973129204
7994. vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on	.	9.779401127904402
7995. readings of the number of milligrams	of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting	heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram	which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack.	7.135992845477965
7996. already	many an american knows his count and rejoices or worries depending	on whether it is nearer 180.	8.749269323788074
7997. out	of cholesterol come keys's main messages so far:    americans	eat too much.	3.8547754392271276
7998. the typical us daily menu says dr	keys contains 3000 calories should contain 2300.	8.722348613158388
7999. and extra weight	increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack.	8.425078407318052
8000. americans eat too much fat.	13.411978530548758
8001. with meat milk butter	and ice cream the calorie-heavy us diet is 40% fat and most	of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind says dr keys	that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary	disease.	4.3082503574921205
8002. throughout much of the	world food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population	has trouble getting the 1600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.	7.695788914849426
8003. the deficiency diseases- scurvy tropical sprue pellagra- run	rampant.	5.064601816720378
8004. in west africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies	must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals	a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or red johnny a growth-stunting	protein deficiency	that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites	and lingering tropical disease.	7.72534046010809
8005. in the well-fed us	deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years.	7.63138465689153
8006. today	as harrison's principles of internal medicine a standard	internist's text puts it the most common form of malnutrition	is caloric excess or obesity.	6.327576840898524
8007. puritan new england regarded	obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin.	6.559331994716633
8008. says	keys: maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral	the fat man would start to think.	7.6951614157143275
8009. morals aside the fat man	has plenty to worry about- over and above the fact that no one any	longer loves him.	6.360265647975516
8010. the simple mechanical strain of overweight says new	york's dr norman jolliffe can overburden and damage the	heart for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac	body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it	was built.	7.853129732893599
8011. the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to	pay higher premiums.	7.544006270535883
8012. he has- for unclear reasons- a 25% higher	death rate from cancer.	5.307838887581181
8013. he is particularly vulnerable to diabetes.	13.97923318888681
8014. he	may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess	body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.	6.714583937038827
8015. physiologically people overeat because what dr jolliffe	calls the appestat is set too high.	6.068066934599666
8016. the appestat which adjusts	the appetite to keep weight constant is located says jolliffe	in the hypothalamus- near the body's temperature sleep and water-balance	controls.	6.088745069666387
8017. physical exercise raises the appestat.	8.072224046538926
8018. in moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances	appetite; but because liquor	has a high caloric value- 100 calories per oz- the heavy	drinker is seldom hungry.	5.627723296469152
8019. in rare cases diseases such as encephalitis	or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying	nearly all sense of satiety.	6.667274784056451
8020. far more frequently	overeating	is the result of a psychological compulsion.	14.157812970212557
8021. it	may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity- or in children	simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging.	5.193758206060004
8022. some	families place undue emphasis on food: conversations center on it	and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment.	6.475546863045154
8023. the	result says jolliffe: the child gains the feeling that food	is the purpose of life.	6.054479986100124
8024. food may act as a sedative giving temporary	emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does.	8.814040621058368
8025. reports	dr keys: a fairly common experience for us is the wife who	finds her husband staying out more and more.	5.631483951808093
8026. he may be interested in	another woman or just like being with the boys.	12.273074223523027
8027. so she fishes around	in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake.	6.726448709182056
8028. it's a matter of	boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something	because she's being deprived of something else.	4.409065231923544
8029. for the	army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers and the gobblers to	the downright gluttons- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely	won.	5.247247136586393
8030. physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants	as the amphetamines	as dangerous crutches	for a weak will.	6.735623349102274
8031. keys has no such objections to metrecal	quaker oats's quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are	currently winning favor from dieters.	4.726480558468627
8032. metrecal is a pretty complete	food he says.	10.07632851749633
8033. it contains large amounts of protein vitamins	and minerals.	10.791024918367663
8034. in the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose	weight on it- 20 30 or 40 lbs.	9.775418007780527
8035. but keys worries that the	metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological	adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.	6.72413610944792
8036. despite his personal distaste for obesity	dr keys has only an incidental interest	in how much americans eat.	8.740409290577412
8037. what concerns him much more is the relationship	of diet to the nation's no 1 killer: coronary artery disease	which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills	500000 americans a year- twice the toll from all varieties of	cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents.	5.150634297750153
8038. cholesterol	the cornerstone of dr keys's theory is a mysterious	yellowish	waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol.	6.052272952419241
8039. scientists	assume that cholesterol	is somehow necessary for the formation of	brain cells since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total	solid weight.	4.6371604856691855
8040. they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones.	16.102447141327573
8041. they	suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and	they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the	circulatory system.	8.093010083041142
8042. but they cannot fully explain the process of its	manufacture by the human liver.	13.474257411316193
8043. although the fatty protein molecules	carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble	cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the	body.	7.337092269813467
8044. a remarkable substance says dr keys quite apart	from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries.	10.443964000617358
8045. when thus deposited keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible	for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks.	6.450066792084764
8046. explains	keys: as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream	they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery.	7.299185856296672
8047. the proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left	behind.	8.646415123408081
8048. as cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the	artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.	8.080591352810032
8049. eventually says keys one of two things happens.	8.44901741695294
8050. a clot forms	at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes	a heart attack.	13.111274463960202
8051. or the deposits themselves	get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that	an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied	by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured.	5.657817410661288
8052. ordinarily the human liver synthesizes	only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation	of fats and for production of bile.	7.400807778526613
8053. even eggs and other cholesterol-rich	foods eaten in normal amounts says dr keys do not materially	affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood.	6.942772790353365
8054. during world war 2 doctors in the netherlands	and scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses of nazi	occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping.	9.201008492397087
8055. not until long after the war- 1950 in fact- did they get	a hint of the reason.	6.171051822576264
8056. that year sweden's haqvin malmros showed	that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe	restrictions on fatty foods.	7.194727747805062
8057. that same year the university of california's	dr laurance kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood	fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood	cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to	rise.	5.84679939812425
8058. here keys and others such as dr a e ahrens of	the rockefeller institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference	between vegetable and animal fats- and even between different	varieties of each.	7.345517128213803
8059. all natural food fats fall into one of three	categories- saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated.	5.601498548237698
8060. the	degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the	fat molecule.	11.106933339232157
8061. saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens.	7.085404632188788
8062. mono-unsaturated	fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule	and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.	6.770610842895149
8063. the three fats have similar caloric values	but each exerts a radically different influence on	blood cholesterol.	6.3032983871001
8064. as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is	much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed.	15.399024646164209
8065. just what	is meant by spirit and by matter?	8.770373913177687
8066.  the terms are generally	taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic	elements in the common experience of all.	10.967030473655347
8067. yet in the contemporary	context this is precisely what one must not do.	10.069917615942103
8068. for in the modern world	neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon	elements of experience.	10.951061110092704
8069. we are in a transitional stage in which	many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected.	8.815173485959564
8070. when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional	meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions	and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.	9.964215165418159
8071. one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the	almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit.	10.490474541686178
8072. just a few centuries	ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of	material entities.	13.096791073932202
8073. not only in popular thought but in that of the highly	educated as well was this true.	10.01737599721236
8074. demons fairies angels and a host	of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential	world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars.	9.91746467430966
8075. in such a world	the words matter and spirit both referred to directly	known realities in the common experience of all.	9.080671100265839
8076. in it important elements	of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general	which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally	and spontaneously.	9.353214004832592
8077. the progress of science over these last	few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific	categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world	of the entities which previously populated it.	7.013484435771585
8078. in carrying out this	program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service	for which it can claim due credit.	9.781911999709097
8079. the objectification of the world	of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the	experience of spirit could justify or support.	6.726992328623042
8080. science is fully competent	to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object	in space and time.	9.794117207951974
8081. when therefore it turned its attention to the	concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world	of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed	as actual elements of external reality.	6.189750403637941
8082. in doing so science has unquestionably	cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous	and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular	superstitions.	10.60531861277468
8083. there have been indeed many important and valuable gains	from the development of our present scientific view of the world	for which we may be rightly grateful.	8.765916894141302
8084. all this has not however	been an unmixed blessing.	13.680978846160713
8085. the scientific debunking of the spirit world	has been in a way too successful and too thorough.	9.126748196713336
8086. the house has	been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means	or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience	of spirit.	8.945602707679205
8087. although the particular form of conceptualization which	popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit	was undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which led to such	excesses remains with us as vividly as ever.	7.153361217055732
8088. we simply find ourselves	in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure	and meaning of this range of our experience.	10.384079708809251
8089. there is no framework	or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and	no part	of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we	can refer this experience.	10.448374634520778
8090. science has simply left us helpless and powerless	in this important sector of our lives.	9.14897700106683
8091. the situation in	which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur	miller's play the crucible which deals with the salem witch	trials.	6.3077136100812625
8092. as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community	of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century.	14.07086496296003
8093. aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides	the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community.	7.759954725074153
8094. the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting	the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns	which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any	age.	8.371957238195167
8095. there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people.	12.807952765863194
8096. instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective	of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things	enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take	the witches and devils which are under discussion.	10.334244033655253
8097. a teenage girl abigail	williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle	the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods	in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with	these evil beings.	6.044152449976617
8098. for all involved in this discussion the devil is	a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night	the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually	can be seen flying through the air.	8.948162743181383
8099. as the play unfolds however	the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil	which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community.	7.133866930616662
8100. everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it.	9.196391104895504
8101. it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail	and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through	the whole town until all have been infected by it.	6.935800484939843
8102. it grows terribly	and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery	moral disintegration and destruction.	9.499059132393885
8103. the audience leaves the play	under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit	in its living active manifestation always evokes.	7.70100746252646
8104. if one asks	about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works	within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give	than spirit.	11.784425963244502
8105. this is not to attempt to say what spirit is but	only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a	common experience.	9.570289877406987
8106. in the end the good man john proctor expresses	what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire	a fire is burning! i hear the boot of lucifer i see his filthy	face! the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and	concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with	formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from	detecting the real devil when he came among them.	8.912076398900547
8107. we marvel at their	blindness for not seeing this.	9.128210153408487
8108. yet are not we of the mid-twentieth	century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the	devil just as bad off as they- only in a different way?	8.658406760954998
8109.  in our	disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are	unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in	this play.	8.018251181921208
8110. we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare	speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment	to that which has already been discredited and proved false.	11.540660088703557
8111. even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score.	8.449426466165553
8112. in	a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the	first act of the play he says at one point: however that experience	never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld	or the existence of lucifer's many-faced lieutenants.	8.89502104922755
8113. and his	belief is not to his discredit.	12.064249099310658
8114. better minds than hale's were-	and still are- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond	our ken.	7.781580429633792
8115. on the other hand a little later on he says:	since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god's	beard and the devil's horns but the world is still gripped between	two diametrically opposed absolutes.	5.812451644841371
8116. the concept of unity in which	positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good	and evil are relative ever-changing and always joined to the same phenomenon-	such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences	and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas h.	8.27503304500424
8117. when we see	the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's	worthlessness- until redeemed- the necessity of the devil may	become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time	again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church	or church-state.	5.872004814911531
8118. apparently he does not intend	that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being	actually real.	11.090266383589361
8119. yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that	the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and	potency of that which came over salem.	7.631678593859151
8120. it casts a spell upon them	so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence	of an evil power.	12.982375977744967
8121. it is not enough in accounting for this feeling	to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together	to produce a cumulative effect.	9.254244524899878
8122. for this does not account for the	integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as	the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness	which comes over those who watch the play like a spell.	9.387865700683482
8123. the	reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions	to the contrary.	6.279047250572346
8124. there is	nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and	universally felt than spirit.	12.981574961979913
8125. apart from spirit there could be no community	for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any	community its unity cohesiveness and permanence.	7.48104806173053
8126. think for example	of the spirit of the marine corps.	15.297901786291858
8127. surely this is a reality we	all acknowledge.	8.74153916905672
8128. we cannot of course assign it any substance.	13.353398297583137
8129. it	is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time.	10.230763407333205
8130. yet	it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and	known.	10.056316963531911
8131. so it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the	spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street	corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux	klan.	6.675860400908966
8132. every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit	is the center of its unity and identity.	13.023554068314803
8133. in searching for clues	which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit	the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove	the most fruitful.	7.56248413999189
8134. for it is primarily in community that we know and	experience spirit.	17.364180917572433
8135. it is spirit which gives life to a community and	causes it to cohere.	12.509475198243395
8136. it is the spirit which is the source of a community's	drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from	the world outside so that the community grows and prospers.	12.503139554088198
8137. yet the	spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community.	7.955633489695482
8138. the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable	ideas.	15.697727350598889
8139. one characteristic of the spirit in community is	its givenness.	12.737237829447333
8140. the members of the community do not create the spirit	but rather find it present and waiting for them.	13.056492018588918
8141. it is for them a given	which they and they alone possess.	13.04606634820278
8142. the spirit of the marine corps	was present and operative before any of the present members of it came	into it.	14.021019584144016
8143. it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it	so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future	recruits to find as they come into it.	9.577110282387412
8144. if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be	understanded of the people- and this it must not be forgotten	is one of the goals of the perennial theological task- there is	no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of	representation.	9.029148868132445
8145. this does not mean that mythological language as	such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.	11.547445801465933
8146. the absurd notion	that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological	concepts completely misrepresents bultmann's intention.	7.382560162815788
8147. his point	is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded	as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing	the christian kerygma.	7.95362932459729
8148. when we say that a mythological mode	of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned	as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding	of existence.	9.550869387952341
8149. mythological concepts may by all means still be used	but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers	that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological	terms.	6.951165194263815
8150. the statement is often made	that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual	stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting	the christian faith.	10.860452982034419
8151. but this statement is completely unconvincing.	13.3149610992168
8152. if bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered	to	the evidence is overwhelming that he does	not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of	traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant.	8.622424059497387
8153. nor is	it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our	culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly	estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been	communicated.	6.6270443910555485
8154. on the contrary even in the heart of the bible	belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there	the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under	way together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself	and his world.	9.727336337523989
8155. in fact it is in just such a situation	that the profundity of bultmann's argument is disclosed.	9.457936183232455
8156. although	the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do	not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity	with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence.	10.791361918741849
8157. this is	especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle	class.	9.07308860773403
8158. time and again in counseling and teaching one encounters	members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity	the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage	and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.	9.214251967285007
8159. the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture-protestantism	so often observed to characterize the preaching	and teaching of the american churches.	6.952259762161874
8160. in the absence of a truly adequate	conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable	need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at	hand- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of	folk religion current in the situation.	9.71199445303942
8161. this is not to say that	the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent	peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely	cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized	gospel.	7.632248448615035
8162. but it is to say that this need is far more important for such	infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.	19.023401543679814
8163. however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly	as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements	of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference	to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.	7.306136527792916
8164. to be	sure when this is pointed out a common response among certain churchmen	is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd	and to take solace from paul's castigation of the wisdom of	the wise in the opening chapter of first corinthians.	8.199594384308643
8165. but can	we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation?	9.354518678978495
8166.  can the church	risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their	wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness	of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways	of talking about the same thing?	9.077681842329971
8167.  can we continue to alienate precisely	those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation	our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious?	5.950623291380903
8168. 	there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church	derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from	that god is completely independent of his creation and	so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.	8.857766556909052
8169. by analogy	the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the	world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be	the church.	8.55415593891083
8170. but as scripture everywhere reminds us god does	have need of his creatures and the church a fortiori can ill afford	to do without the talents with which the world by god's providence	presents it.	9.218607418618857
8171. and yet this is exactly the risk we run when	we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel	in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured	men.	8.703536451947357
8172. until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened	men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources	on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.	8.144867925808345
8173. in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted	that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved;	and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when	we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction.	5.973105389663379
8174. but the main point	here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the	demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable.	10.66004329921192
8175. this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without	condition.	12.507400476507003
8176. if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise	say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then	my only choice is to refuse to be a christian.	12.911721177161109
8177. expressed differently:	if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ	is some form of self-destruction whether of the body or of the mind-	sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus- then there is	no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.	4.867659416975825
8178. this must be	stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding	chapter.	13.67920946608397
8179. modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has	come of age; and though this process by no means represents	an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from	the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still	a positive step forward; and those of us who so richly benefit from	it should be the last to despise it.	6.641320621869472
8180. in any event it is an irreversible	step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we	have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has	seen fit to place us.	14.464560629307764
8181. to say this of course is to take up a	position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred	years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern	period in theological thought.	10.27105490429483
8182. we have aligned ourselves with that	liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among	the great names in its history those of schleiermacher ritschl	herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and	the early barth and in part at least bultmann.	8.083913689787174
8183. it is to this same	tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and	a half of american theology also belong.	11.002271397905949
8184. for we must number here not	only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention	those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of	the brothers niebuhr and tillich as	well.	8.723473161605868
8185. finally we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously	neoliberal movement that developed at the university	of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work	of alfred north whitehead.	6.533519774797182
8186. what makes this long and diverse	tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it	have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively	modern world.	10.087124794196905
8187. although they have also been concerned to stand squarely	within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited	no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity.	7.044856546240403
8188. they have insisted rather on living fully and completely	within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god	have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.	10.463612455118064
8189. when we say then that today in our situation the demand for	demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply	saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring	achievement.	8.752248365641119
8190. however much we may have to criticize liberal theology's	constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive	to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it.	8.373981429497233
8191. in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking	the deadlock into which bultmann's attempt to formulate such a	theology has led.	5.88839143125723
8192. for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives	to his position variously represented by the other participants	in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative.	10.866969690822582
8193. if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be	accepted	by theology unconditionally the position of the right is	clearly untenable.	10.800426516530978
8194. whereas bultmann's center position is structurally	inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds	alone the general position of the right as represented say	by karl barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of	the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material	grounds we have just considered.	8.12810996090035
8195. it follows then provided	the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative	is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented	on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least	is found in much that is significant in american and english theology.	7.44801944184701
8196. in order to make the implications of our position as clear	as possible we may develop this argument at greater length.	13.29459201883199
8197. we	may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other	than the three typically represented by bultmann barth and buri.	7.188478395159444
8198. to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms	of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more	than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless	question.	11.50496045530036
8199. thus if what is at issue is whether all s	is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p	or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question	is false.	7.338150637226299
8200. hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology	myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether	only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted;	for in either event the first possibility is excluded.	10.034256394541814
8201. therefore	the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand	by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive	positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third	but really pseudo position of bultmann.	6.425373292989998
8202. a second point requires more extended comment.	11.974735453515434
8203. it will be recalled	from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the right	as represented by barth rests on the following thesis: the	only tenable alternative to bultmann's position is a theology that	rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization	and existential interpretation; accepts instead a	special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and	in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus	christ by means of statements that from bultmann's point of	view are mythological.	4.947791716978071
8204. one hundred years ago there existed in england the association	for the promotion of the unity of christendom.	15.84449443336292
8205. representing	as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman	and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable	to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was	condemned by the holy office in 1864.	6.1088127664542275
8206. now again in 1961 in	england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly	discussed as christian unity.	9.412714754887201
8207. the church unity octave january	18-25 was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various	churches.	7.667885087548503
8208. many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict	whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian	unity in 1961 than there was in 1861.	12.98314232564725
8209. but it must be readily seen	that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these	hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side.	8.0794758034637
8210. for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly	universe has written.	11.048824340642778
8211. i came to england last summer to	do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman.	9.82359848431133
8212. as an	american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions	and expectations; being intellectually influenced by newman	and the general 19th-century literature of england i knew only a	protestant-dominated	country.	6.639393982846011
8213. since arriving here however i have formed	a far different religious picture of present-day england.	5.963258565189593
8214. in representing	part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my	own personal experiences reactions and judgments; but my primary aim	is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing	and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the	present religious	state of england.	7.604034862680947
8215. since the protestant clergy for the	most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman	collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman	catholic cleric.	6.182509142293398
8216. in any case i have always been treated with the	utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where	anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest.	8.44469083078573
8217. nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism.	8.18116241274294
8218. on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well	as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires	and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not	concerned with the historical significance of the day.	8.701652661471853
8219. a birmingham	newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the	true story of guy fawkes which began:   when you	pile your	guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the	true story of guy fawkes you will remember?	5.902467919390852
8220.  in the 355 years since	the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten	so here is a reminder.	12.532417769743978
8221. the article proceeded to give an inaccurate	account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1.	7.3841005422235355
8222. in	spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the	conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's	the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very	small one which did not enjoy a gracious	hearing from the general public.	8.278197445576659
8223. the return of the catholic hierarchy	in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact	was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty.	7.766790883209616
8224. in 1864 newman professedly	had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in	order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers.	9.28486381084273
8225. now in 1961 the catholic population of england is still	quite small; yet it represents a very	considerable percentage of the churchgoing population.	6.756283536402677
8226. a protestant	woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham	oratory church on sunday mornings.	10.971669975308664
8227. she found	this a marvel because as she said only six per cent of english people	are churchgoers.	8.982147997425145
8228. she may not have been exact on this number but	others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than	ten.	11.906783101412975
8229. from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly	attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during	services.	6.705798297456342
8230. a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of	a large city university following anglican evensong at which there	was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a	hundred.	7.843455902279242
8231. the protestants themselves are the first to admit the	great falling off in effective membership in their churches.	7.6501369586319665
8232. according	to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england	the total of confirmed members is 9748000 but only 2887671	are registered on the parochial church rolls and over 27 million	people in england are baptized into the church of england but	roughly only a tenth of them continue.	9.91277111556254
8233. an amazing article in the	manchester guardian of last november entitled fate of redundant	churches states than an archbishops' commission reported	last month that in the church of england alone there are 790	churches which are redundant now or will be in 20 years' time.	6.291535179199725
8234. a further	260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948.	10.480751749782208
8235. and	in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has	authorized	the demolition or more often the sale of 764 chapels.	7.173612030752086
8236. most of	these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither anglicans	nor	nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics	and have done so.	8.848855843562127
8237. while it must be said that these same	protestants have built some new churches during this period and that	religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason	for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are	going to church.	6.651755266487741
8238. it should be admitted too that there is a good	percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics	.	16.939924120577565
8239. still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear	from the remarks of many people that protestants are decreasing and	catholics increasing.	7.83863131900158
8240. an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly	but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true.	11.63087287807988
8241. a century ago	newman saw that liberalism would	gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and	that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable	breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own.	5.605543681067952
8242. that day is perhaps today 1961 and it seems no longer very meaningful	to call england a protestant country.	9.578229230263307
8243. one of the ironies	of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively	speaking many real christians to unite.	11.426589375350247
8244. many english	catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are	in a new ascendancy.	10.464833704245635
8245. the london universe devoted its centenary	issue	last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress	during the last one hundred years.	6.391566163405857
8246. with traditional nationalistic spirit	some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism	at its best.	8.625870067539255
8247. i have found myself saying with other foreigners here	that english catholics are good catholics.	8.892759754292829
8248. it has been my experience	to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone	in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses	at mass.	10.718207283934749
8249. they hope of course to reclaim the non-catholic	population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction	they recite by heart the prayer for england:   o blessed	virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother	look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us	all who greatly hope and trust in thee h.	5.181346077301476
8250. intercede for our separated	brethren that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the	chief shepherd the vicar of thy son h.	8.116581656463973
8251. a hymn often to be	heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories	in england's ancient faith that endured persecution and which	proclaims: faith of our fathers: mary's prayersshall win	our country back to thee.	4.498932907016714
8252. the english saints are widely venerated	quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs	and cardinal newman will soon be canonized.	10.752110509695232
8253. because they	have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have	always strongly resented the charge of being un-english.	7.456612321208743
8254. i	have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it	is still in the air.	9.167766110430996
8255. for example a writer in a recent number of the	queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the	only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion	that they are 'un-english'.	7.293461869129174
8256. in this connection it has been	observed that the increasing number of irish catholics priests and	laity in england while certainly seen as good for catholicism	is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic	english catholics especially when these irishmen offer to remind	their christian brethren of this good.	9.241341047509087
8257. one of the	more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century	is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities.	7.803911655537888
8258. at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics	partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854.	14.360889807449526
8259. moreover	for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the	city to care for their religious needs.	6.45962638299349
8260. now not only are there considerably	more laity as students and professors at oxford but there	are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable	and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university.	7.645557073163752
8261. some catholic priests lecture there; catholic seminarians attend	tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students.	4.733761391342129
8262. further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable	position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it	in the mass media of england.	9.016094894520279
8263. the general tone of articles appearing	in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the	sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic	church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant	churches.	6.415042921835098
8264. on successive sundays during october 1960 paul ferris	wrote articles in the observer depicting	clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist	church.	12.209328015483973
8265. the catholic priest though somewhat superficially	drawn easily came out the best.	7.657156065707981
8266. there were many letters of strong	protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed	portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters	and without really very much to do as clergyman.	11.262490573393857
8267. such a series of	articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian	england.	8.086954922325663
8268. there was so much interest shown in this present-day	venture that it was continued on bbc where comments were	equally made by an anglican parson a free church minister and a catholic	priest.	9.59165568965248
8269. catholic priests have frequently appeared on	television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal	footing with protestant clergymen.	6.067859606934685
8270. a notable example of this was	the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool	dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr	ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury.	8.777119343876892
8271. the good	feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now	well known in england.	7.021091045771775
8272. the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary	has been televised several times in recent months.	9.509835326783428
8273. and it was	interesting to observe that bbc's television film on christmas	eve was the bells of st mary's.	6.977417371539014
8274. of course	the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern	of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr	fisher then anglican archbishop of canterbury to the vatican	last december.	9.246150865875418
8275. it was the first time an english primate has done	this since the 14th century.	11.755001697180779
8276. english catholics reacted to this event	with moderate but real hope.	8.84291539982784
8277. almost daily something is reported	which feeds this catholic hope in england: statistics of the increasing	numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants; news of	a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic	priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a catholic nun	had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during	the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a	respectable periodical that catholics if the present system is still	in operation will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords	in the next generation; a report that 200 protestant clergymen	and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at	a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave.	4.657541801274573
8278. the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal.	22.967928665571
8279. the straight	line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality.	7.08282385665725
8280. but	how can one figure symbolize both?	9.401575356806818
8281.    christianity declares that	in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal	concur.	9.714423608119441
8282. perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique	and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as irenaeus.	8.45553815601911
8283. to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical	individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic	aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself	with man's history.	6.78883406057712
8284. yet this utterly individual historical person	must also contain within himself the common history of mankind.	9.05263227932366
8285. his	history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in	it.	7.550564042635688
8286. his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the	crucifixion of jesus.	11.210556395467533
8287. each man can identify himself with the history	and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified	himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a	new humanity.	8.398540956718342
8288. not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral	represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has	motion as well as recurrence.	10.351671364139168
8289. as represented by a spiral history may	in some sense be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event	remains unique.	6.822943168947579
8290. christ is both unique and universal.	10.989487874118836
8291. the first	turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam.	7.9369519389588
8292. as	origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning	so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of	christ.	13.707355353143262
8293. whence then comes the substance of the first man?	8.571350931282232
8294.  from	god's will and wisdom and from virgin earth.	7.7741268865296576
8295. for 'god had	not rained' says the scripture before man was made 'and there	was no man to till the earth'.	4.582308696570202
8296. from this earth then while it was	still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity.	11.216660033881123
8297. irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private	individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity.	7.627510447469115
8298. adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed	perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development	toward perfection.	17.95737306480793
8299. they were in fact children.	17.620940254123337
8300. irenaeus does not	claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for	him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the	fall.	8.657327332251825
8301. existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence	of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity	into history.	6.183126737723943
8302. historical existence is a created good.	10.582598031109338
8303. the biblical	symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: so	god created man in his own image; in the similitude of god he created	him.	6.441851308713628
8304. there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where	the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished so	most notably in the statement: if the holy spirit is absent	from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and being	left carnal he will be an imperfect being possessing the image	of	god in his formation but not receiving the similitude of god	through the spirit.	8.819272306805725
8305. thus the image of god is that which makes	a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of god by contrast	is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature.	9.006744290964187
8306. recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that	he does not consistently maintain this distinction.	8.736960947611912
8307. he does not mean	to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through	the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly	mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.	8.077351643895987
8308. therefore irenaeus describes man's creation as follows:	so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur and become lifted	up as if he had no lord because of the dominion that had been	given to him and the freedom fall into sin against god his creator	overstepping his bounds and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance	towards god a law was given him by god that he might know	that he had for lord the lord of all.	8.117219301665516
8309. and he laid down for him certain	conditions: so that if he kept the command of god then he would	always remain as he was that is immortal; but if he did not he	would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken.	6.578270954371569
8310. these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal;	yet he did not stop being human as a result.	8.868854745114618
8311. there is no justification	for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image	of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the	later theological distinction between the image of god and	the similitude of god.	8.593164139162148
8312. man was created with the	capacity for immortality but the devil's promise of immortality	in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality.	7.429203619704669
8313. he was in the	words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality.	8.792278221052259
8314. the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man	did not believe this.	9.696416238787693
8315. eve was disobedient; for she did	not obey when as yet she was a virgin.	5.616820786460667
8316. and even as she having indeed	a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin h having	become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and	to the entire human race; so also did mary having a man betrothed	to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become	the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race.	8.322116616882322
8317. because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere	potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created	as children irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience	as being due no doubt to carelessness but still wicked.	7.2793490521682
8318. his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts	him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin	mary.	12.842242007096301
8319. that parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too;	for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man	so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought	death into the world and all our woe.	9.219757806753131
8320. with this act of disobedience	and not with the inception of his individual existence man	began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from	the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality.	8.585346391108725
8321. at	the nadir of that circuit is death.	8.425872565976173
8322. along with the fruit they did	also fall under the power of death because they did eat in disobedience;	and disobedience to god entails death.	9.69715289731152
8323. wherefore as they became	forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it.	7.327610752864967
8324. this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam	and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday	as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday; he sees	a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath.	9.011493056578486
8325. in	any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of	the tree they obtained mortality instead.	6.47874230788756
8326. the wages of sin is death.	18.011573980451907
8327. man's life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with	god must now be conformed to the shape of death.	4.8855991903684055
8328. nevertheless	even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs	to god and he still rules.	9.620723538700455
8329. even death therefore has a providential	as well as a punitive function.	8.162176303089373
8330. wherefore also he god	drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree	of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture	to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that	he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded	him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable.	8.189229617992838
8331. but	he set a bound to his state of sin by interposing death and thus	causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the	flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at	length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god.	7.642666937631228
8332. this	idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well	into the scheme of irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for	the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ.	6.977216454558633
8333. as man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that	christ could bring many to life.	8.189509105746064
8334. it is probably fair to say	that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of	sin is.	13.99855346755407
8335. this applies to his picture of adam.	12.693771277433864
8336. it is borne out also	by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation	to the next.	11.410743471967649
8337. it becomes most evident in his description of	christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but	whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality.	7.370267387825848
8338. this emphasis	upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem irenaeus	shares with many early theologians especially the greek-speaking ones.	6.255987161114152
8339. they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility	which can mean deliverance from	time and history.	10.47877189968513
8340. death reminds man of his sin but it reminds	him also of his transience.	10.37420811589553
8341. it represents a punishment that he knows	he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives	his life within the process of time.	8.278402761437116
8342. these two aspects of death cannot	be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified.	10.794975313466493
8343. the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as	altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of	death cannot be separated.	7.380192592299091
8344. such efforts almost always find themselves	compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and	then older and then still older in short whether adam's life was	intended to be part of the process of time.	8.567281209866996
8345. if it was then it must	have been god's intention to translate him at a certain point from	time to eternity.	8.411192585960395
8346. one night so some of these theories run adam would	have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve;	and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal.	10.892884554117177
8347. the	embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an	illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for	some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the	natural order of time and change.	7.018079867367519
8348. on the other hand christian	faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal	existence.	17.34456987107292
8349. it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law.	15.250218570858765
8350. if	this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea	of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that	temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state	into which man is put by the will of the creator.	10.127563727207654
8351. this seems to have	been the conclusion to which origen was forced.	10.46034962087898
8352. if death receives	more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives	less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ	begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal	ie created existence.	10.999660059034406
8353. such an interpretation of death radically	alters the christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation	from not salvation in time and history.	6.679565831447957
8354. because christianity	teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of	christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision	of the christian understanding of the work of christ.	11.453914839250944
8355. furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly	is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right	to refuse to accept persons it dislikes.	6.220371181813971
8356. the unitarian clergy were	an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood	in the back bay- and parker was definitely not a gentleman	either in theology or in manners.	6.404121694996986
8357. ezra stiles gannett an honorable	representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the	issue in 1845 insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated	and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force	could exist.	5.597311859782103
8358. even so gannett judiciously argued the association could	legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor	assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard	to their correctness.	9.67202615628995
8359. we today are not entitled to excoriate	honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who	barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their	congregations.	6.501093394994195
8360. one can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-	that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture	to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker	use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should	come to occupy it.	7.710355577689794
8361. finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen	as gannett's son explained in the biography of his father	they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title	of christians.	5.577249525845629
8362. their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for	intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry	to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a natural religion.	7.980004060783905
8363. grant all this- still when modern unitarianism and	the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults	parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker	received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience.	4.894061783521845
8364. whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation	of parker and the fraternity on january 23 1843- while it	may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker	leave the association while it may plead that dr n l frothingham	had every warrant for stating the difference between trinitarians	and unitarians is a difference in christianity; the difference	between mr parker and the association is a difference	between no christianity and christianity- despite these supposed	conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh	of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite	brought itself officially to expel parker.	6.725375233157497
8365. had it done so the blot	on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard	divinity school assemble today to honor parker's insurgence other	than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi.	5.664094860099727
8366. happily for posterity then the boston association did	not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close	for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality.	9.58652613694789
8367. fortunately	the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol	defended parker's sincerity as did also gannett and chandler	robbins; whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and	rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship.	6.030728641731395
8368. in the	hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the	hand	and requested parker to visit him- whereupon our burly theodore	again burst into tears.	6.778654267806329
8369. all this near tragedy which to us borders	on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always	warming ourselves with a glow of complacency.	7.545661724799472
8370. it was indeed a near	thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england	did triumph.	12.759044536942959
8371. to the extent	that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying	he asked for it.	6.764027966797325
8372. yet even after all these stratagems the conscience	of christian liberality is still not laid to rest any more than is	the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance	for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson's the divinity school	address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.	7.382232450710842
8373. in both cases	the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant	apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought	to the test it behaved shabbily.	5.722271088324474
8374. suppose they both had ventured into	realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen	settle frank differences of opinion?	7.513936688486634
8375.  is it after all possible	that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity	they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any	conservative has ever to worry about?	6.996944732862222
8376.    however there is a crucial	difference between the two histories.	17.030133015797553
8377. emerson evaded the problem	by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked	out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his	departure preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious	veneration.	5.164769881559194
8378. parker insisted upon not resigning even when the majority	wanted him to depart upon daring the fellowship to throw him	out.	9.063305700777734
8379. hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards	a canker within the liberal sensitivity.	8.382274468273165
8380. he still points an accusing	finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support	him nor the energy to cut his throat.	10.26265907672447
8381. actually the dispute	between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and	social was a real one a bitter one.	8.247056487225551
8382. it cannot be smoothed over by	now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or	by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections	to him.	9.4596288709388
8383. the fact is incontestable: that liberal world of unitarian	boston was narrow-minded intellectually sterile smug afraid	of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm	and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle	foundations were threatened.	5.678745449114108
8384. parker along with garrison and	charles sumner showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs	mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery.	8.376210046732691
8385. nevertheless	we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace;	their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists	is clear-cut.	5.770086090518234
8386. but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within	the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository	of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by	holding him up as the champion of freedom.	8.841719351708216
8387. even though his theological	theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation	he phrased is very much with us.	7.745733841855527
8388. it has been endlessly rephrased	but i may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves	obliged to become intolerant?	9.31482746416836
8389.  and then as they become aware	that they have reached the end of their patience what do they to	their dismay learn for the first time about themselves?	9.510593705707995
8390.    there	can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel	in enforcing its canons of behavior.	9.481975059501483
8391. the gentle channing revered	by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville	that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant	spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and	action: no city in the world is governed so little by a police	and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.	5.855402385526371
8392. we stand more in awe of one another than most people.	13.119609510148944
8393. opinion is	less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod	of iron.	5.865080561954301
8394. even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius	channing added- remember this is channing not parker!-	that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart should	he speak without book and consequently break some law of speech	or be hurried into some daring hyperbole he should find little mercy.	7.080489562082513
8395. channing wrote this- in a letter! i think it fair to	say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons.	4.741055247362255
8396. but theodore	parker commencing his mission to the world-at-large disguised	as the minister of a twenty-eighth congregational church which	bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the	founders made explicit	from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish	society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel	difference about clerical decorum.	7.564179155091686
8397. because he spoke openly with what	channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- parker	vindicated channing's further prophecy that he who committed	this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals	were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.	4.866952601503445
8398. an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an	institution and only within those defined limits a license.	8.267463527782288
8399. by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should	i am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the	battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest.	7.245979958634844
8400. he	arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had	to respond with at the least resentment.	8.783968374697807
8401. what otherwise could the	lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when	told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three	archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually	cried 'holy holy holy is the almighty	dollar'?	5.798639614037186
8402. 	nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan	stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be	astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of	rage as parker snarled at them thus: talk about the catholics	voting as the bishop tells! reproach the catholics for it! you	and i do the same thing.	6.384551250717809
8403. there are a great many bishops who have never	had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not	to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar	a pope much nearer home.	7.575851160773882
8404. boston has been controlled by a few capitalists	lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and	the preachers what to think.	9.33843534036825
8405. parker meant business.	11.163583134021476
8406. and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended	them: even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria	and are worse than those who deceived them- which implied that they	were very bad indeed.	7.4063822315465355
8407. it was duty he said that his parents	had given him as a rule- beyond even the love that suffused his	being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied- and	it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted	him by the age of fifty.	7.75244993518959
8408. parker could weep- and he wept astonishingly	often and on the slightest provocation- but the psychology of	those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to	massacre his opponents.	6.271202998965505
8409. if it gave me pleasure to say hard things	he wrote i would shut up forever.	9.915842084162758
8410. we have to tell ourselves	that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because	he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter	tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than	fire.	11.072880643258143
8411. because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself	up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england	he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's	consciences.	6.800159153774825
8412. our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how	strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very	issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its	christian survival that of the literal factual historicity of the	miracles as reported in the four gospels.	8.960621007995549
8413. it is idle to ask why we	are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety	decides anew	that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the	water into wine at eleven a m on the third of august a	d 32.	7.603062712015766
8414. we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed.	16.958600488796844
8415. so we are	the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right	side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass	on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode.	6.276491589006324
8416. we have not	the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working	in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard	divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most	formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying	that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked	miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine.	7.852253208867072
8417. i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty	into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about	which i have not a shadow of doubt.	8.468799606369075
8418. it has been my lot all through	life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with	them the deepest and most vital of all questions the nature of the	hope of a life beyond this.	11.234543372529894
8419. i have also constantly engaged in scientific	work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science	as well as in the religions in the world.	9.459584195053363
8420. in an amateurish yet in	a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology	astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation	of the advances being made in these fields.	9.397156635797112
8421. at one time i became	disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent	inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a higher	criticism of the bible to refute which i felt the need of a better	knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology for it seemed to me that	to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.	8.092086585813647
8422. doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while	and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the	bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have	been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:	attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bible-loving	generation and a critical doubting bible-emancipated race.	7.672694030053648
8423. although	still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i	stood outside shivering in the cold.	6.890980766674158
8424. in one thing the higher	critics like the modernists however overreached themselves in claiming	that the gospel of john was not written in john's time but	well after the first century perhaps as late as 150 ad.	9.047851163517992
8425. now	if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking	through his servant it is john's gospel.	8.414366200039483
8426. to ask me to believe	that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the	events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the	spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any	of those recorded in the bible.	8.455654982479215
8427. here i took my leave of my learned	friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern	name of pragmatism or the thing that works.	7.811364031788835
8428. test it try it and	if it works accept it as a guiding principle.	10.386105775111497
8429. so i put my	bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and	then tested it to see how it worked.	7.628543393644481
8430. as a short possibly not the best	method i looked up word in the concordance and noted that	the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god's personal	message to man.	7.951764793416593
8431. the next traditional step then was to accept it	as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would	accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to	its conditions according to christ's invitation and promise that	if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether	it be of god or whether i speak of myself.	6.052045636888797
8432. the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance	of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly	different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of	our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man	by the virgin mary the saviour of the world.	12.101432068229615
8433. i believe	therefore that we are without exception sinners by nature alienated	from god and that jesus christ the son of god came to earth	the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay	the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives christ	as his personal saviour is born again spiritually with new	privileges appetites and affections destined to live and grow in	his likeness forever.	7.484595214627616
8434. nor can any man save himself by good works or	by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural	fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally	expressing itself through such avenues.	7.86270488750951
8435. i now ever look for	christ acording to his promises and those of the old testament as	well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness	over the whole earth.	6.842344226183471
8436. to state fully what the bible	means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to	formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and	friends.	8.482601640121544
8437. the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as	bread is food for the body.	8.72335598061009
8438. again as faith reveals god my father	and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me	daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer.	7.944891576379739
8439. i place his	precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability dismissing	cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed	to him.	6.750471026532615
8440. i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ	who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him	even though called to stand alone before the world.	9.047331628602391
8441. our lord's	invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see.	5.8009153696153195
8442. i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld	a very sick man in terrible pain.	10.093303763043517
8443. as i ministered to his needs	i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i	learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and	nurse but also the lord.	8.091663430289092
8444. in his heart he had that peace of which	the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace	i give unto you: not as the world giveth give i unto you.	10.164974474456814
8445. let	not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid.	7.531059987915813
8446. what	a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by	the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very	dear to him.	10.379960604065255
8447. he was about to leave them to depart from this world	and return to his father in heaven.	10.769982759483847
8448. before he left them he promised	that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts	and minds.	10.378639373672707
8449. i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who	has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ.	10.083306841215801
8450. it makes	my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord's guidance	while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.	11.469487572168562
8451. how	often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking	for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents	not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and	his creatures.	6.2470761946167075
8452. looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote	these blessed words almost three thousand years ago: thou wilt	keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee: because	he trusteth in thee.	6.174157318119761
8453. are you longing for peace in your heart?	11.407917402120434
8454. 	such a calm and assuring peace can be yours.	8.201975104232357
8455. as only a member	of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise	one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits	that are promised to those who are his own.	11.31444320864572
8456. perhaps you are	not his child.	15.492329675742111
8457. perhaps you do not know if you belong to him.	13.593343229324297
8458. you	may know that you are in god's family and be just as sure of it as	you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father.	11.325872595548823
8459. god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that	whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life	and as many as received him to them gave he power to become	the sons of god even to them that believe on his name.	9.624159350455265
8460. it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that	he gives his peace; not that empty peace the world offers but a deep	abiding peace which nothing can destroy.	11.870874277589259
8461. why not open your	heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your saviour	and	let him fill you with peace that only he can give.	7.626748996434832
8462. then	with the hymn writer of old you can say:   i am resting today	in his wonderful peace   resting sweetly in jesus' control.	5.835464719440233
8463. i am kept from all danger by night and by day   and	his glory is flooding my soul.	7.590417151962017
8464. satellites sputniks rockets	balloons; what next?	7.404781715275503
8465.  our necks are stiff from gazing at	the wonders of outer space which have captured the imagination of the	american public.	6.191777645799994
8466. cape canaveral's achievements thunder forth from	the radio television and newspaper.	6.557998643966819
8467. while we are filling	outer space with scientific successes for many the inner space	of their soul is an aching void.	6.372404520204287
8468. proof?	16.542242831953253
8469.  an average of 50 suicides	are reported in america each day! one out of every three or	four marriages end in divorce! over $200000000 is paid yearly to	the 80000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful	mankind who want to know what the future holds! delinquency	juvenile and adult is at an all-time high! further proof?	4.53429614287896
8470.  read	your daily newspaper!   unfortunately in our rush to beat	the russians we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ:	what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world	that includes outer space and lose his own soul?	5.916204244591254
8471.  or what	shall a man give in exchange for his soul?	8.615272094039502
8472. .	16.542242831953253
8473. gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business	according to god's standards.	6.078976547577407
8474. it is true that we must	keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments; only	a fool would think otherwise.	11.000573120177249
8475. but we must not forget man's soul.	11.783905690005525
8476. is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news	that god put his son	jesus christ on earth to live and die to	save our hell-bound souls?	8.714501231601332
8477.  for god so loved the world that	he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should	not perish but have everlasting life.	8.965112302498484
8478. never	forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.	9.024702464250653
8479. your spiritual	inner space helps determine the spirituality of america	as a nation.	6.238271905966141
8480. we trust you are not one of the 70000000 americans	who do not attend church but who feel that various forms of recreation	are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great.	10.300495330548006
8481. is forgiveness of past sins assurance of present help and	hope of future bliss in your orbit?	6.937503601111154
8482.  or are you trying the devil's	substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within?	8.23006837464706
8483.  pleasure	fame and fortune drowning your troubles with a drink and living	it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry:	they may ease your hunger temporarily but they'll never take the	place of a satisfying mouth-watering steak.	3.8759557811188543
8484. no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will	relieve the gnawing of your inner space.	9.302197076043731
8485. why?	12.348350321510317
8486.  because your	soul was made to be filled with god himself not religious functions	about him.	12.756019381121407
8487. only he can satisfy the deepest longings.	11.371989819915852
8488. that	is why the bible commands you to taste and see that the lord	is good: blessed happy is the man that trusteth in him	.	8.895354474342048
8489. you can receive god into your heart and life	by a step of personal faith.	8.923435092450159
8490. accept the sinless son of god jesus	christ as your own personal saviour.	10.904319140868262
8491. as many as received him	jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even	to them that believe on his name	the lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	10.145804362989455
8492. 	the lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall i be	afraid?	9.396165904196307
8493. 	psalm 27:1   a certain teacher scheduled a fear party	for her fourth grade pupils.	5.218676334235918
8494. it was a session at which all the youngsters	were told to express their fears to get them out in the open	where they could talk about them freely.	12.72751038904238
8495. the teacher thought it was	so successful that she asks: wouldn't it be helpful to all age	groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their	fears and worries?	5.955692380911193
8496.    dr george w crane a medical	columnist thinks it would.	9.330846636272666
8497. he says: that would reduce neurotic	ailments tremendously.	5.799207844918809
8498. each week an estimated 20 million patients call	upon us doctors.	9.758880157999673
8499. of this number 50% or 10 million patients have	no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.	6.444166965731734
8500. yet they keep running from one physician to another largely to get	a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles.	9.246139776434218
8501. one of	the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus	be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions.	6.6702033155902125
8502. we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to	deal with the problem of fear these days.	13.75599106195735
8503. it must be getting more serious.	15.294097163599067
8504. people are giving their doctors a hard time.	10.887661463610085
8505. one doctor made	a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and	he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened;	30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely	beyond their control; 12% of them worried about their health	although their ailments were imaginary; 10% of them worried about	their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable	of taking care of themselves.	5.403213252523815
8506. only 8% of the worries had behind	them real causes which demanded attention.	7.91756398924654
8507. well most of our	fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something	else to worry about: why then do we have these fears?	6.441893117852321
8508.  what	is the real cause of them?	10.528148782196736
8509.  what is there about us that makes us so	anxious?	11.15321577758581
8510.    look at the things we do to escape our fears and	to forget our worries.	13.276198682216602
8511. we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune	tellers and soothsayers.	10.270581295446403
8512. we spend billions of dollars at the race	tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling.	12.968696239782938
8513. we spend billions	of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of	escapist entertainment.	8.048190150087946
8514. we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers	and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions	that are tearing us apart.	8.533683263047266
8515. a visitor from a more peaceful	country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after	he had seen it all he said to a friend: you must be a very	sad people.	7.830795738497345
8516. sad was not the right word of course.	12.882202636016167
8517. he should	have said jittery for that's what we are.	5.677817535610855
8518. and that's worse	than sad.	7.192909164146088
8519. watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges	and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means	an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed	to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give	men a few hours of dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell	that many of them are running away from something.	5.818169165327361
8520. in one of	his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign	of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates.	8.781937273928476
8521. yes	and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing.	8.039480527373678
8522. does that	explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business?	11.013034336212245
8523. 	we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons	dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate.	7.9237838874931406
8524. i doubt that	fear parties and group confessionals will help very much.	11.333962355372378
8525. suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then?	9.064007184771985
8526.  isn't that	where most of them are already- right out on the front page of our	newspapers?	7.5416624137527455
8527.  maybe we are talking about them too much.	9.156917374616441
8528. the question	is: what are we going to do about them?	12.132521293763856
8529.    meanwhile the	enemy will capitalize on our fears if he can.	7.327854739045126
8530. hitler did just that	23 years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then	to a world war.	8.8540186331852
8531. the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand	and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate	for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate.	7.909547530024758
8532. it is	said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals	to attack.	10.842938491895373
8533. it could have the same effect on communists.	17.32626518627425
8534. the president	of the united states has said: we will never negotiate out	of fear and we will never fear to negotiate.	11.130302174336473
8535. that is a sound position	but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely	as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not	afraid.	10.361741167129436
8536. and that's another reason why it is imperative for us these	days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace.	7.828220269634043
8537. turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do	that.	12.831021434247681
8538. in psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful words which you must	have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you	or to drive them out if they have you in their grip: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	8.91944422749484
8539.  the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid?	11.301350759752301
8540.    well	you say those are beautiful words all right but it was easy for the	psalmist to sing them in his day.	9.938756771013841
8541. he didn't live in a world of perpetual	peril like ours.	6.498328494214457
8542. he didn't know anything about the problems	we face today.	6.856990798902702
8543. no?	12.348350321510317
8544.  read the next two verses: when the	wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh	they stumbled and fell.	8.125569813107413
8545. though an host should encamp against me my	heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me in this will	i be confident.	5.783262563975088
8546. that is almost a perfect description of	the predicament in which we find ourselves today isn't it?	11.290287059072902
8547.  our	enemy is also threatening to devour us.	7.097875637460299
8548. he has already devoured huge	areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains	and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing	not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they	try to escape their prison.	8.247698456235165
8549. yes indeed we too can see a warlike	host of infidels encamped against us.	7.2636911516413285
8550. what a terrible thing that	wailing wall in berlin! a man with a baby in his arms stood	there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest	of the family.	12.122291710457432
8551. another man tried to swim across the river from the east	to the west but was shot and killed.	9.345291550007877
8552. a middle aged woman opened	a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall	she threw out a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured.	8.27689570420972
8553. the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation	most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there	anymore.	10.880147027136479
8554. practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends	that live in the opposite part of the city.	12.006455197402575
8555. people stand at the wall	giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists	pleading for loved ones.	6.860380149396721
8556. but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers	that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible	profanity.	10.710592011187053
8557. there is only one escape left a tragic one and too	many people are taking it: suicide.	10.403995079281371
8558. the normal rate of suicides in	east berlin was one a day but since the border was closed on august	13 it has jumped to 25 a day!   these things may be happening	many miles away from us but really they are right next door.	8.08028467195087
8559. we are	all involved in them deeply involved.	10.085325313395616
8560. and nobody knows what comes next.	14.688811987970722
8561. we live from crisis to crisis.	11.82341317973842
8562. and there is only one way for a	man to conquer his fears in such a world.	16.875717890970282
8563. he must learn to say with	true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	7.296871835971382
8564.  the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid?	15.139648919033608
8565. 	notice	that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret	of his faith.	7.3810179245502265
8566. first the lord is my light.	20.254297985821292
8567. he lived in a	very dark world but he was not in the dark.	15.236539841887698
8568. the same god who called	this world into being when he said: let there be light!-	those were his very first creative words- he began the world with	light- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged	into darkness.	6.39273683373923
8569. for those who put their trust in him he still says	every day again: let there be light! and there is light!	in fact he came into this world himself in the person of	his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human	sin and said: i am the light of the world: he that followeth	me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.	5.886032044211379
8570. the	psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only	anticipate the coming of christ.	10.442737909993431
8571. he lived in the dawn; he could	only see the light coming over the horizon.	9.727624403298206
8572. we live in the bright daylight	of that great event; for us it is a fact in history.	11.765573381356731
8573. why should	we not have the same faith and an even greater experience of the light	which it gives?	8.467767266957603
8574.    this is the faith that moved the psalmist	to add his second conception of god: the lord is h my salvation.	10.760978867965054
8575. he knew that his god would save him from his enemies	because he had saved him from his sins.	9.241563213779393
8576. if god could do that he could	do anything.	16.568609987253193
8577. the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his	flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul.	7.550113589786609
8578. and god had conquered that one by his grace! so why worry about	all the others?	8.010614004552128
8579.    the apostle paul said the same thing in the	language and faith of the new testament: he that spared not	his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with	him freely give us all things?	6.586311610055805
8580.  h if god be for us who can be	against us?	12.322403817241282
8581.  h who shall separate us from the love of christ?	9.150058819744958
8582. 	shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness	or peril or sword?	7.343574939739029
8583.    salvation!	this is the key to	the conquest of fear.	5.883382530770245
8584. this gets down to the heart of our problem for	it reconciles us with god whom we fear most of all because we have	sinned against him.	12.383591248820592
8585. when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus	christ when we know that he is our savior that he has paid our	debt with his blood that he has met the demands of god's justice	and thus has turned his wrath away- when we know that we have peace	with god in our hearts; and then with this god on our side	we can face the whole world without fear.	6.611079099173789
8586. and so the psalmist	gives us one more picture of god: the lord is the strength	of my life.	10.30045273187744
8587. the word is really stronghold.	13.880371676455557
8588. it recalls those	words of another psalm: god is our refuge and strength a very	present help in trouble.	8.354837683290617
8589. therefore will not we fear though the earth	be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the	sea h come behold the works of the lord what desolations he	hath made in the earth.	7.344124601659808
8590. but again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until	the close of the ninth century ad when an arabic scholar tabit	ibn korra is said to have discussed the magic square of	three.	10.76918712994111
8591. thus while it remains possible that the babylonians andor	the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before	the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from	the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her	claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years.	6.582782737645341
8592. the	concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a	forceful ruler which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of	the	warring states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese	empire under the ch'in dynasty.	8.474305045534164
8593. but this	was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian	despotism.	7.944429280156753
8594. among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor	shih huang-ti in his efforts to insure the continuation of	this hard-won national unity was the burning of the books in 213 bc	with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for	divergent thinking; but as he had a special fondness for magic and	divination he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared.	7.131099080537934
8595. many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning	of the vast ch'in palace some ten years later; yet some must have	survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination	and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting	china and keeping it together for a longer period	.	6.105124492230673
8596. in fact during	the first century bc an extensive literature sprang up devoted	to these subjects finding its typical expression in the so-called	wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to	the lo shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection	with divination.	8.207276867391343
8597. however the wei books were also destroyed	in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final	proscription in 605.	6.472195379159268
8598. after all this destruction of old literature	it should be obvious why we have so little information about the	early history and development of the lo shu which was already	semisecret anyhow.	10.725218234306165
8599. but in spite of all this enough evidence remains	to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object	of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching fullest	expression in the han period.	7.066623302707542
8600. although modern scholars have	expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere	mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence	on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries	they could have found most of the answers right within the square	itself.	8.740241843659652
8601. but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent	mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers-	singly or in combination- and then tried to consider these in	the light of old chinese cosmological concepts.	5.7944839013530824
8602. such an analysis	speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu 5	was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints	that they had a knowledge of this diagram.	11.114621696307305
8603. the importance of this	5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of	the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the	numbers- quite apart from any numerological considerations which is	to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it.	6.507600895920527
8604. indeed mathematically	speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most	important number in the entire diagram.	8.76299412891438
8605. if one takes the middle	number 5 and multiplies it by 3	the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of	all the rows columns and two main diagonals.	7.556956391516311
8606. then if the middle number	is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through	multiplying it by the highest number 9	the result is 45; and the latter is the total sum	of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are	overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.	11.516343660444925
8607. furthermore	the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical	mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of	its central position; it is also their mathematical mean since it	is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal 10.	7.053836915462284
8608. in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium	would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese.	12.280702647652056
8609. for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female	equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature;	and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and	small odd numbers and those composed of large and small even	numbers were all equal to each other.	6.100592971095702
8610. thus all differences were	leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and	the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively	symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.	9.822245365676812
8611. the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square-	for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that this number so	neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain	why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 and	why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality.	7.6673239943210945
8612. these twin	tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty.	11.773328083980559
8613. the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further	stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when	the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow-	which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions-	and took 5 as the dynastic number believing that he would thus	place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious	influences.	5.624570454134648
8614. his immediate motive for doing this may not have	been directly inspired by the lo shu but this measure must inevitably	have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.	9.168159503577924
8615. after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well	as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping one's	self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest.	8.012991322270542
8616. later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too	literally.	12.457390379027762
8617. all this emphasis on centrality and on the number	5 as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun	as far back as 400 bc also may conceivably have led to the development	of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to	fit everything into numerical categories of five.	7.138170862493579
8618. we find for example	such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains	the five directions the five metals five	colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five	bodily functions five viscera and many others.	7.86201435536644
8619. this trend has	often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though	they had served as the base for all the rest; but why did the old	chinese postulate five elements when the ancient near east-	which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence	in human life and activities- recognized only four?	5.797146521397663
8620.  and why	did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions	when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only	the usual four?	9.232999594558795
8621.  obviously something suddenly caused them to start	thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of	the lo shu.	7.943660165308266
8622. this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect	on chinese thinking.	10.92141878781183
8623. whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu	diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties-	and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on	some mathematical bases- the urgent desire to place everything into	categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until	an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought.	5.445450256638245
8624. scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature	or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that	seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and	philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought	in china for many centuries.	7.577307426507605
8625. square	although the primary mathematical properties of the middle	number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation	of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep	fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers	this was actually only a beginning of wonders.	9.215539471807341
8626. for the lo	shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief	religious and philosophical ideas of its time.	10.830367067978772
8627. as such one cannot	fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without	knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu; but conversely	one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something	about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they	saw expressed in it.	6.73647583660719
8628. the chinese world view during the han dynasty	when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its	popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang	and five-elements school which was traditionally founded by tsou	yen.	9.871932338518185
8629. according to this doctrine the universe was ruled by heaven	t'ien- as a natural force or in the personification of a supreme	sky-god- governing all things by means of a process called the	tao	which can be roughly interpreted as the order of the universe	or the universal way.	6.585961634353067
8630. heaven acting through the tao	expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles	the yin and the yang.	9.049472492433141
8631. the yang or male principle was the source	of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun; while	the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet	inactivity and was associated with the moon.	5.8722562693076314
8632. together these two	principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were	present in everything.	10.530647992763642
8633. we have already seen that odd numbers	were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so	that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two	principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center.	6.7951356960834195
8634. during	the han dynasty another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo	shu considering the latter as a plan of ancient china.	8.531730369398199
8635. instead	of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine	provinces as was usually	done this equated the odd yang numbers	with mountains and the even numbers	with rivers; taking the former	from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from	the principal river systems of old china.	6.151500848037283
8636. thus the middle	number 5 represented sung-shan in honan central china; the	3 t'ai-shan in shantung east china; the 7 hwa-shan in shensi	west china; the 1 heng-shan in hopei north china	; and the	9 huo-shan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain.	3.9745722372668566
8637. for the rivers the 4 represented the huai to the southeast;	the 2 the san kiang southwest;	the 8 the chi in the northeast; and the 6 the yellow river	in the northwest.	4.8960866623845005
8638. note that by western standards this	plan was upside down as it put north at the bottom and south	at the top with the other directions correspondingly altered; but in	this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention	for all maps.	7.9004308235259755
8639. the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was	equated with the nine provinces; and whenever the lo shu	involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion.	6.462433881556584
8640. few persons who join the church are insincere.	13.261306022403234
8641. they earnestly desire	to do the will of god.	10.960712399466555
8642. when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve	christian stature it is an indictment of the church.	13.258156161502793
8643. these	fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure	to follow through.	5.88962434481404
8644. a program of lay visitation evangelism can	end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless	practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active	fellowship.	10.684257865236903
8645. the work of lay visitation evangelism is not	completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have	been interviewed.	9.345481238951944
8646. in the average situation about one-third of those visited	make commitments to christ and the church.	9.370852089168848
8647. the pastor and the	membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow	through immediately with a carefully planned program.	7.651024560406718
8648. the first thirty	to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine	their interest and participation in the life of the church.	12.278332063030001
8649. neglect	means spiritual paralysis or death.	7.32317759867447
8650. churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation	and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members	loyal and active.	11.527052445674855
8651. this is the answer to the problem of membership	delinquency.	22.347126655722718
8652. it is important that persons desiring to	unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it	may be meaningful and spiritually significant.	13.86259727760152
8653. it is unfair and unchristian	to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership	before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.	8.117820852381115
8654. preparation for church membership begins immediately after	_ the pastor writes a personal letter	to each individual expressing his joy over the decision assuring	him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time and outlining	the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday.	6.822739547725345
8655. some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported	by the visitors.	7.699985836667562
8656. it should not be postponed later than the next day.	20.886640740421957
8657. _ the pastor	calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance	conference.	5.999127002113452
8658. if possible he should make an appointment in order	that all persons involved may be present.	10.905262589950357
8659. this is not a social	call.	23.005602412898323
8660. it is definitely a spiritual guidance conference.	20.019141289471797
8661. he	will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity	of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the	membership preparation sessions.	6.990406863810277
8662. there may be problems of conduct or	questions of belief which will require his counsel.	12.442755484975102
8663. each conference	should be concluded naturally with prayer.	7.7641107147866455
8664. a piece of devotional material	_	a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary	for adults.	9.025300631940778
8665. none should ask less.	13.07449222878258
8666. those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the	meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred	vows.	14.42208312804299
8667. they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper	devotion to it if membership requires something of them.	10.200342196115464
8668. many	churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time	for adult preparation classes.	9.58617174590069
8669. others meet on sunday night at the	mid-week service or for a series of four nights.	7.1332381309655695
8670. some pastors have	two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between.	9.974246379915233
8671. the sessions should cover four major areas: - the christian	faith - duties of church	membership - the local church and its program	following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing	with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the	week.	4.3481893659957525
8672. this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership	packet.	14.40059406373791
8673. most pastors find	that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore	hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday.	7.735656501273295
8674. in this session	the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the	work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the	local church.	12.217541294305374
8675. the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak	on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church	school missions men's work women's work youth program social	activities and finances.	5.609236617112599
8676. the budget of the church may be presented	and pledges solicited at this session.	13.850566859578647
8677. an interest finder or	talent sheet may be filled out by each person.	7.36969351084257
8678. the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the	church facilities and refreshments.	13.414093201384551
8679. the social time gives an opportunity	for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members.	9.308491161423348
8680. suggestions for membership preparation	in conducting	the membership preparation-inquirers' class the pastor should	plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest	on the part of the class.	8.939188171968079
8681. the following have been found effective.	12.044138043399268
8682. _ extend the number of classes.	7.617548308327283
8683. some churches have	six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday	night or during the week.	6.9889107041422704
8684. this gives greater opportunity for the	in	_ use	audio-visual aids.	10.592336251036317
8685. some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion	pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to	_ have a question box.	5.10739154717692
8686. some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly.	12.428529422621294
8687. urge them	_ use a textbook	_ select class members for	_ ask each member	to write a statement on such topics as: what christ means to	me what the church means to me why join the church	_ assign	_ invite	class members to share in an extra period of bible study each	_ ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty	to the reception service.	4.152816312352797
8688. there	is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that	all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory	training including those coming by transfer of membership.	11.031241480218348
8689. george e	sweazey writes: there is danger in trying to make admission	to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know	that anything has happened.	6.082091371300172
8690. people appreciate experiences	that demand something of them.	11.270639974878746
8691. those who transfer their membership are	no exception to the rule.	9.579073349632866
8692. for most of them it will be their first	experience in membership training since this is a recent development	in many churches.	14.34040355639583
8693. those coming from other denominations will welcome	the opportunity to become informed.	7.934493747992664
8694. the preparatory class is	an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted	with one another.	7.75795490038694
8695. it provides a natural transition into the life	of the local church and its organizations.	10.974210429144309
8696. fellowship	the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo	when the group of new members stands before the congregation to	declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship	of the church.	9.642435817599972
8697. this should be a high moment in their lives a	never-to-be-forgotten	experience.	11.10411075901792
8698. they should sense the tremendous significance	of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our	lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.	9.179098794186693
8699. every detail of the service merits careful attention- the	hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction	to the congregation the welcome of the congregation.	6.4425050643580795
8700. this is	a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation.	12.14564778705992
8701. it will help	to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church.	15.938470744714277
8702. it	can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual	growth and decay.	9.863642118331825
8703. the worship service is the natural and logical	time to receive new members into the church.	7.585365681228651
8704. the atmosphere for	this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the	worship experience.	9.823598022493226
8705. psychologically the reception should be the	_ ask the new members to meet thirty	minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge	cards.	6.316356923305896
8706. some denominations ask new members to sign personally the	chronological membership register.	10.451278062102931
8707. provide a name card for each	_ arrange a	reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together.	5.49120898696987
8708. _ invite sponsors or fellowship	friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service.	9.489047653203398
8709. _	introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face	_ lead the congregation in a response of	_ have a reception for new members in the parlor or	_ take a picture of	the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the	_ have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with	new members as guests.	5.8614414122291105
8710. growth of new members	the church is the family of god.	12.035473320634077
8711. the members of the family are drawn together by a common love	for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom.	9.313047091001822
8712. every member	of the family must have a vital place in its life.	11.862213059405681
8713. this is no spectator-type	experience; everyone is to be a participant.	11.158481281643198
8714. yet the	most difficult problem in the church's program of evangelism is right	at this point- helping new members to become participating growing	parts of the fellowship.	6.9710277571264125
8715. very easily they may be neglected and eventually	join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.	7.837789998883765
8716. a study	of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period	revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who	joined the church were lost to the church within seven years.	8.853228732756907
8717. one	denomination had a membership of 1419833 at the beginning of the	period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at 1541991-	a net growth of only 122158.	6.803601876573696
8718. yet during the same period there	were 1080062 additions.	12.904025293187104
8719. another major church body had 4499608	members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4622444.	8.114899422311574
8720. during	this time 4122354 new members were brought into the fellowship.	11.165074099586699
8721. still another denomination had 7360187 members twenty years ago.	8.446450243924435
8722. during	this period 7484268 members were received yet the net membership	now is only 9910741.	9.95753761492229
8723. these figures indicate that we are losing	almost as many as we are receiving into membership.	9.147561066410603
8724. this problem	is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the	active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.	10.541845783201227
8725. studies of membership trends even in some areas where population	is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net	increase though many new members were received.	7.026761219193432
8726. something is wrong when	these things happen.	11.303124045535519
8727. the local family of god has failed its	new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare.	7.986488495396639
8728. new members can become participating growing	members.	12.93768549210487
8729. but this will not happen merely through the natural process	of social life.	9.81835090462367
8730. it must be planned and carefully developed.	18.940214867978593
8731. the	entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part	in this dynamic process.	7.268624256222957
8732. if the church has followed the plan	of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership	preparation as outlined earlier in this book the process of assimilation	and growth will be well under way.	10.621280150214561
8733. those who enter the front	door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will	not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest.	7.507408062208605
8734. however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment	and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship.	16.096507357868862
8735. when	they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction	of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into	effective christians.	6.738035944528748
8736. the church expects certain things of	those who become members.	12.483519738427777
8737. the new members justifiably expect some things	from their church family:  - welcome into the fellowship	- sincere christian love and understanding  - inspiring	and challenging worship experiences  - social and recreational	activities  - opportunities for christian service	- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	- creative prayer experiences  - guidance in christian	social concerns	men need unity and they need god.	3.539715293595778
8738. care must be taken neither	to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas	about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands.	8.472930429526567
8739. the statement also points to a classic paradox: the more men turn	toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but	also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established	the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one	another.	6.350528581632319
8740. to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map	and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political	ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race.	9.853431658151276
8741. massacres	attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state	of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such	divisions can engender.	6.792382446413984
8742. the words of cardinal newman come forcibly	to	mind: oh how we hate one another for the love of god!	the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify.	8.115666327401913
8743. institutions require structure form and definition	and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion.	5.926280425435951
8744. a completely	amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms; to escape	this fate it must rule some things out.	7.69511388207312
8745. for every criterion which	defines what something is at the same time proclaims- implicitly if	not openly- what that something is not.	6.8475040225568105
8746. some persons are so sensitive	to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether;	in the present context this amounts to the advice that while	being religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense	with churches.	8.644895638348352
8747. man is at once a gregarious	animal and a form-creating being.	11.94025290817219
8748. having once committed himself to	an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms	for its expression and institutions for its continuance.	7.771115636187354
8749. to propose that	men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing	that they be learned without having schools.	6.272363721540763
8750. both eventualities	are possible logically but practically they are impossible.	9.484618897350305
8751. as much	as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally	require the institutions that will direct their steps toward	him.	6.685285331703009
8752. yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men	at odds with their fellows.	11.828680197980272
8753. is there any way out of the predicament?	18.084859613592613
8754. 	the only way that i can see is through communication.	10.61817879486361
8755. interfaith	communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited	upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our	adversaries.	8.077905955269545
8756. approached creatively it is a high art.	12.98721741876323
8757. it is the art	of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that	the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not	thwart god's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary.	6.222029882757766
8758. in a certain sense interfaith communication parallels diplomatic	communication among the nation-states.	12.065032185160991
8759. what are the pertinent	facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history?	8.829785873638745
8760. 	i shall touch on three areas: personal national and theological.	6.43911664212233
8761. by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality	structure.	7.543191035628483
8762. some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological	differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they	can blame distrust denounce and even hate.	10.082259605645298
8763. such needs may rise	to pathological proportions.	8.481670166652743
8764. modern psychology has shown that paralleling	the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality	in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine	to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured	if it does not exist naturally.	8.384003048048447
8765. fortunately the number of	pathological bigots appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake	to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the	rest of us.	8.839930694664682
8766. to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices	attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.	14.639770062126983
8767. interfaith	conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most	unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever.	6.571170693758822
8768. it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must	learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them	that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the	healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.	12.429534971475046
8769. while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith	conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable.	7.079332452263473
8770. the	specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which	has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century.	10.472489673401196
8771. emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the	afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.	5.5036265631299885
8772. no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence	since world war 2 and the number is growing by the year.	11.169238421219115
8773. as	an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication	have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between	christians and non-christians in these lands.	4.730633994950466
8774. colonialism alone would	have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity	is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that	repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation	of the other.	9.073812522622985
8775. actually however this turns out to be only part of	the picture.	10.50854094767597
8776. nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign	religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying	in slumber for centuries.	9.058208544421975
8777. the truth is that any revival of traditional	and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity	and volksgeist which these young nations very much need.	7.635229657596672
8778. insofar	as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life	which constitute ultimate trans-political justifications for their existence	such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which	these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's.	7.69149645643918
8779. all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural	communication for which christian missions stand.	6.942730360024325
8780. africans and asians	tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have	produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not	of direct political propaganda.	7.726599223002726
8781. the people hardest hit by this suspicion	are of course christians on the mainland of china.	8.223346925977872
8782. but the	problem extends elsewhere.	16.374682657648634
8783. for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists	argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion.	9.1434281324499
8784. in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly christian-	schools to the rejoicing of most of its 7000000 buddhists and	the lament of its 800000 roman catholics.	7.341662301350356
8785. again india has imposed	formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries	and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against	christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru	and his followers is gone.	6.191435825717363
8786. the progressive closing of afro-asian	ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation	i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo.	8.471734639366348
8787. i was	seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists' world	radio program.	9.38310943319654
8788. he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable	number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio	networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.	11.16260671831008
8789. after returning to the united states and raising the money he	discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available.	9.47396443804756
8790. it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval;	they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes.	11.408294482773906
8791. it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost	vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures	and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this	heightening of anti-christian sentiment.	7.789459252992862
8792. ironically these are the	groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since	world war 2 while the more established denominations are barely	maintaining pre-war staffs.	6.919310363071189
8793. although i have emphasized the	barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between	christians and non-christians in asia the fact is that this development	has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions	themselves.	6.6132875706580085
8794. the partition of india has hardly improved relations	between hindus and muslims; neither has the establishment of the	state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews.	8.16113058927607
8795. i turn finally to several theological developments.	9.435729076807798
8796. the modern world has been marked by progressive	disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever	its political form.	10.776939391634
8797. the american constitution was historic at	this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting	an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.	6.3315360360582496
8798. one of our foremost jurists david dudley field has gone so	far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in	the course of human history.	9.604030733246313
8799. the trend throughout the world's	religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical	validity of this constitutional enactment.	6.763979387464178
8800. pakistan was created in	1947 expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven	years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed	in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think	their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political	situation.	8.9391060160524
8801. what is the point charles adams reports the pakistanis	as asking in demanding an islamic state and society if no	one not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves can say clearly	and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is?	7.82431855151331
8802. 	the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly	secular.	7.683459220362503
8803. and while the nation was formerly named the islamic	republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan.	9.41537882146715
8804. comparable trends can be noted elsewhere.	10.555668197651205
8805. the new regime	in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor.	7.407279409403219
8806. the	religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige	in recent months.	8.914258299385423
8807. during the years when israel was passing from	crisis to crisis- the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of	penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose of national unity	could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious	parties.	5.6357017670925735
8808. now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction	of tensions the secularists are less disposed to compromise.	9.445120428971958
8809. and in this country gustave weigel's delineation of the line between	the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign	served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the	practical autonomy of both church and state.	6.825953626087082
8810. the failure at that time	of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added	a ring of good sense to father weigel's theological argument.	8.801557787009777
8811. everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that	governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible-	in a word too human- to warrant any claim of maintaining	partnership with the divine.	6.503520921499627
8812. my	father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded	to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands	and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese	souls were going to hell each second because these students were not	over there saving them.	7.524104183249097
8813. that mention of this should bring smiles to	our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent	to which attitudes have changed.	6.838085094331686
8814. i do not mean to imply that christians	have adopted the liberal assumption so prevalent in hinduism	that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit.	11.403227776347414
8815. leslie	newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council	of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality	for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids	us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it.	6.771359497538354
8816. newbiggin's qualification on the christian claim is of considerable	significance.	7.9210077261597505
8817. the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of	its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation	outside the visible church.	8.368792423139679
8818. in mentioning this under salvation	reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine	has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the	world community what that doctrine is.	11.675220547196975
8819. when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit	the termination of the human race by human action because	there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify	such a thing they know exactly what they mean.	8.179467424219517
8820. of course in prudential	calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against	the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can	be forthcoming than the subject allows.	8.986442346306513
8821. yet it seems clear that there	can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave	to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.	6.4731800957929195
8822. i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit.	12.768122725900104
8823. he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks	and danger in general.	9.81323814110054
8824. he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously	does an evil thing	as it efficaciously does some good.	11.028116407401724
8825. he	is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes	directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both;	of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended	or not directly intended but still both are done while the	evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown	to be among the consequences.	6.152755192661877
8826. this is what in a technical sense	to only permit an evil result means.	13.161752281053712
8827. it means to do it	and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect	of the good one primarily does and intends.	8.851717544782503
8828. of course grave guiltiness	may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action	of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits	in this sense the termination of the human race by human action.	10.505553475561307
8829. certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives	it is never possible that no world would be preferable to	some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the	destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative.	6.939732291747171
8830. naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action	is uncertain this has to be taken into account.	14.371857977679877
8831. especially is this	true when because the good effect is remote and speculative while	the evil is certain and grave the action is prohibited.	6.818197606719262
8832. presumably	if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the	evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the	evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation	of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty	in the good or evil effect must be taken into account.	9.418687849073939
8833. there must	not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater	probability of actually doing more good than harm.	7.0692172891083
8834. if an evil which	is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for	by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every	present certain and immediate good that may have	to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future	evil.	7.907353164647632
8835. nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins	in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences	before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.	6.56892784627634
8836. he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences	of his action.	16.776557466091127
8837. above all he does not debate mere contingencies	and therefore if these are possibly dreadful find himself forced	into inaction.	8.007036396386265
8838. he does what he can and may and must without regarding	himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with	guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not	permit in the sense explained.	12.846380148910947
8839. by contrast a good deal of nuclear	pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and	not with the moral nature of the action to be done; and by deriving	legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly	or probably result whether by anyone's doing or by accident	it finds itself driven to inaction to non-political action in politics	and non-military action in military affairs and to the not very surprising	discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense	of justice can possibly be based.	5.399414814363572
8840. mr philip toynbee	writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as	likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near	future if the present situation continues.	10.162540326455035
8841. if it continues indefinitely	it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will	be made and that the devastation will begin.	9.19085651145026
8842. against such a termination	of human life on earth by human action he then proposes as an	alternative that we negotiate at once with the russians and get the	best terms which are available that we deliberately negotiate	from comparative weakness.	9.706727080067354
8843. he bravely attempts to face this alternative	realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome	namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few	years.	7.288650251009446
8844. this would be by far the better choice when it is a question	of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination	of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to	destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish.	10.483880961970176
8845. nevertheless the	consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified:	it is a possible result however improbable; the worst and	least probable result; if it didn't prevail mankind would	still be given the opportunity of prevailing; for surely	anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility	of nuclear war.	4.419238472340994
8846. if we have not thought and made a decision entirely	in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following	simple test: have we decided how we are to kill the other	members of our household in the event of our being less injured than	they are?	9.725383787793065
8847.  thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward	from the likely eventuality; it is no longer to be formulated in terms	of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate	effect or the thing to be done.	6.979329103140577
8848. several of the replies	to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology	with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the	actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be	made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in	danger of this evil.	7.929867159736758
8849. it is worse for a nation to give in to evil	h than to run the risk of annihilation.	11.057681512466257
8850. i am consciously prepared	to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident' rather	than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design.	7.2734456546405575
8851. but	i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need	not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against	accidents or by limiting war?	6.747132910340661
8852.  quoting mr kennan's	phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably	to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a	policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war.	9.21577041766703
8853. if	asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility	most men will choose the latter.	6.624696015203257
8854. if h philip toynbee	is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk	of nuclear war i think he is right.	10.476575715651965
8855. i do not accept that the choice	is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war.	10.557233103059595
8856. even	professor arnold toynbee agreeing with his son does so in these	terms: compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of	the destruction of the human race all other evils are lesser evils h.	8.052204403598797
8857. let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving	the human race at whatever the temporary price may be.	7.311043946608728
8858. mr	philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the	anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four if he believed	communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then	he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the	risk of a communist world.	8.365634850089242
8859. even a nuclear holocaust is a little less	frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the	earth until doomsday.	7.431357631341555
8860. no political order or economic system is	so clearly contrary to nature.	9.60325521710285
8861. but one does not have to affirm the existence	of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order	in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to	affirm the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted	in social institutions and social relationships except in the context	of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force.	6.982316326707109
8862. on their	way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo	of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility	for its preservation.	9.76312923350759
8863. not to repel injury and uphold and improve	pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice	that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep	slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.	6.8631858539668675
8864. toynbee	seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social	embodiment.	18.243792417512005
8865. i would far rather die after a russian occupation of	this country- by some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly	by atomisation.	5.0873469534246265
8866. would such an act of refusal be useful?	18.37386126834212
8867.  he does	not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the	proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation	in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order	to reverse the consequences of that surrender.	6.8701365864785595
8868. he wants to be	brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless-	far far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956.	9.80521591286063
8869. this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by	creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited	weapons.	6.5933704617221345
8870. it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other	than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned	more positive means for attaining it in the past.	11.0353280256642
8871. it is	no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso	that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance	by occupied peoples.	7.200759096878629
8872. hope for the future h would lie in the	natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop.	12.154653414249706
8873. this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted	to the very last; it is to stride along the steep slope downward.	6.933109426938385
8874. the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the	risk of war; and now and in the future unlike in the past any	attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment	of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear	warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render	this planet less habitable by the human race.	9.571720680903814
8875. that is why it is	so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision	as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from	any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities	or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related	to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.	7.090695849013665
8876. finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful	analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end	of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination	the same thing must be said in connection with the question	of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate	this end.	9.264132476278673
8877. we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought	about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle	for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that	in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence	among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know	not what future.	7.229372419780303
8878. much more than shelter housing symbolizes social status	a sense of belonging acceptance within a given group or neighborhood	identification with particular cultural values and social institutions	feelings of pride and worth aspirations and hopes basic to	human well-being.	7.72486691176796
8879. for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination	in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow	upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans.	5.0928094948199
8880. few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure	to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders.	9.229227765351919
8881. this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying	their professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for the human	aspirations of racial minority groups in this country.	5.739884180002967
8882. it is not surprising	that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association	of real estate boards and its local associations	have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.	10.549923525639054
8883. how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing	restrictions based on race religion or ethnic attachment?	8.565808500233102
8884.  what	does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest?	12.674842295805801
8885.  what	ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social	change?	6.789538537804253
8886.  what social ethical and theological insights can the	church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation?	9.907752657981291
8887. 	recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan university's public	affairs center sought some answers to these questions.	5.4345981036232205
8888. several	new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium	of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists	social ethicists and theologians.	7.321407450184151
8889. here in an atmosphere	of forthrightness and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular	insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing	and the part each man present played in it.	7.501401262813303
8890. for a number of years	wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business	leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty	and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their	responsibility for public policy.	9.503939980588896
8891. this article presents our observations	of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the	faculty and students saw them.	7.5824844766731685
8892. such conversation quickly reveals	an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most	realtors.	7.3209825159578115
8893. within the membership of this group as has been found true	of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready	portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply	serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between	them.	7.851796042001269
8894. professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving	the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner.	9.116711702104237
8895. but as	conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another	image emerges that of considerable power and influence in the community.	7.316859971315862
8896. obviously much more than customer expectation is determining	the realtor's role.	9.739587017371228
8897. judgments are continually rendered regarding	the potential buyers' income educational level and above all racial	extraction; and whether these would qualify them for congenial	happy relations to other people in certain community areas.	4.6491806880621915
8898. how explicit such factors have been	historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases	or in a review of nareb's code of ethics article 34 in	the code adopted in 1924 states that a realtor should never be	instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property	or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals	whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that	neighborhood.	7.102809680279514
8899. though the reference to race was stricken by the association	in 1950 being an agent of such detrimental influences	still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to	avoid.	6.388005978409778
8900. the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently	expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed stigma they believed	would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white	particularly negro peoples into all-white restricted areas.	5.565312643113165
8901. they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real	estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause	or reform and this was no longer to be a pro.	7.928300040966711
8902. obviously	what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional	with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing	of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper	meaning and associations of one's work.	6.818457010138962
8903. these men- for the most	part educated in our best new england colleges well established	financially and socially in the community- under kindly but insistent	probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data	for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the	people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually	follow their occasional breach of a client-service relationship.	4.753367216270999
8904. this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present	realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the	power and respectability of the realtors increase.	9.192781229152075
8905. as our discussion	continued the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation	of their way of operating became evident.	8.073794773306833
8906. realtors	live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as	members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic	leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers	etc.	8.015255524864454
8907. from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that	shapes his moral understanding.	6.808239772856556
8908. it seems to us that choices exercised	by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas:	the various ways in which they interpret a particular social	issue; their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political	processes; and most pervasively their interpretation of	who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in	a technical fragmented society.	8.684328249457884
8909. most of the realtors minimized	their own understanding of and role in the racial issue pleading	that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.	8.51468703526203
8910. there is some reality to this; the commission on race and housing	concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate	men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any	other segment of the american population.	13.224316903086365
8911. but such a reaction obscures	the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and	its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices.	7.744944720741813
8912. also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment	continually employed.	11.917004180448332
8913. like business and university groups generally	these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and	psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions	they make.	5.761983419583011
8914. realtors both generally and in this group have invariably	equated residential integration with a decline in property values	a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.	8.202197808023666
8915. recent	studies by the commission on race and housing and others however	point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.	6.768951962214033
8916. there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated	residentially without great loss of property values the white population	having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation	of the negroes' desire for well-kept housing privacy etc.	8.704017937450677
8917. data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial	group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property	values before the group comes in.	8.948437282969117
8918. often they are able to get in	only because the area is declining economically.	12.562826114846057
8919. significantly	no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of	the six volumes	that present the commission's findings.	5.9499744578887235
8920. no one anticipates any radical	shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits	the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must	surely be raised.	9.128746756091573
8921. the role of both church and university as sources	of information and settings within which the implications of such information	may be explored needs consideration.	8.040163594934995
8922. relevant facts	however	extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance	of harmonious neighborhoods.	9.145081018155972
8923. discussion of minority housing necessarily	involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic	conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity	the function and limitations of government in the securing of such	equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents	of racial agitation and strife.	4.436730985977461
8924. realtors realize of course that they are involved in an	increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities	for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities	for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination	in housing.	8.955321708025025
8925. on the positive side recent federal action has largely	undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position;	anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted	by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the	tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.	5.778781086848755
8926. realtors in attendance	at the colloquium expressed interest for example in connecticut's	new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would	like to have to obey but in support of which none had been willing	to go on public record.	8.69247693735297
8927. as far as they were aware the connecticut	association of real estate boards had not officially opposed	the bill's passage or lobbied in its support.	7.406169154034309
8928. in 1957 the real estate boards of new york city	actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination	law.	11.455401067535897
8929. official reasoning: the bill was a wanton invasion	there are sins of omission as	well as commission; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations	either negative or positive plays a large part in the public	acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively	enforced.	6.198384275140745
8930. judicial opinion since the supreme court decision	on shelley v kraemer has rendered racial restrictive	covenants unenforcible.	8.05131272355703
8931. such a decision should have placed a powerful	weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little	evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated	the principle in such clauses.	8.559439167921354
8932. in the states that have passed	laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing	support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage	through additional legislation could help remove the label of social	reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to	avoid.	9.24944815238382
8933. but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially	to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority	buyers into all-white neighborhoods.	6.270426419346002
8934. one of the roles of	the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with	the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities	offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise	of broad social responsibilities in their work.	9.745508700987527
8935. but responsiveness to	these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human	good and not simply as a professional white american good.	8.145836722560762
8936. such	judgments are meaningful only	in so far as persons are members of a world	let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is	also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.	8.816617864256155
8937. that community	of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and	the concrete norm of all moral judgment.	6.728422008961423
8938. racial discrimination is wrong	then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying	to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the	grain of creation and against the will of the creator.	11.018181597156541
8939. thus moral issues	concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take	on theological dimensions.	10.554855420252917
8940. over the years	individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable	unity in the methods and practices employed.	13.552705520048999
8941. most realtors and	real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people	with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions.	7.507872521200461
8942. but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow	sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already	noted?	7.904077705725467
8943.  our faculty and students pressed this issue more than	any other.	6.911332891840832
8944. as a theologian in the group pointed out a professional	was before the modern period of technical specialization one who	professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use	of his particular skills.	11.142924839708702
8945. if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there	are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization:	science and religion.	7.730015310668533
8946. science is placing in our	hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom.	14.991119759490143
8947. religion	or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build	a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether	we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed.	7.744980776611012
8948. how can we	have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?	12.556766887778743
8949.    we	may feel pessimistic at the outlook.	8.274582368518889
8950. and yet there is a note of	hope	because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is	also giving us atomic vision.	14.007688883577265
8951. we are looking inside the atom and seeing	there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material	a universe that in a word is not matter but music.	8.298899250582608
8952. and it is	in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration	of our faith.	11.291140662846075
8953. to see this vision in perspective	we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new	power from the atom.	8.784029274197458
8954. you know that i could hold right here in my	hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb	that dropped on hiroshima.	12.473052588637481
8955. it was only about the size of a baseball;	but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of	20000 tons of tnt.	8.9835602281936
8956. that is enough tnt to fill the tower	of the empire state building; and with the availability of bombs	of that size war became a new problem.	9.452749999164336
8957. now we might have restricted	the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium	because it is found in only a few places in the world.	8.79628775783826
8958. but we had hardly	started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we	were faced with the hydrogen bomb.	11.020390193080804
8959. hydrogen is just as plentiful as	uranium is scarce.	7.816322636343856
8960. we know that we have hydrogen in water; water is	f and the h stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen in wood	and hydrogen in our bodies.	8.674747457468715
8961. i have calculated that if i could snap	my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen	in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of	the kind that fell on hiroshima.	9.158208291470332
8962. i won't try the experiment but	i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let	ourselves go there would be quite an explosion.	10.293212371471911
8963. and then think how	little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware	bay or in the ocean beyond.	9.451944666988076
8964. salt water is still f the same hydrogen	is there.	10.63973281742861
8965. and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the	destructive power we hold in our hands today.	9.81757606931465
8966. of course there	is also an optimistic side to the picture.	13.248297972260739
8967. for if i knew the secret	of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity	i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power	in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories	in the entire united states for some days.	7.378241192913506
8968. and think if we all knew	this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility	company we would make.	9.922261322781
8969. with just the hydrogen of our bodies we	could run the world for years.	9.15992887256205
8970. then think of delaware bay and the	ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years	to come.	11.992687149556755
8971. it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world	provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone	everywhere.	8.575338469734238
8972. now let us see where this power	comes from.	10.802614815174564
8973. to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate	first of all how small the atom is.	8.62520279531899
8974. i have been trying to make this	clear to my own class in chemistry.	14.607706382135323
8975. one night there were some dried	peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little	group of atoms; and i asked myself a question: suppose i	had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an	area would they cover?	6.325840888497786
8976.    i calculated first that there are	about an octillion atoms in the average human body; that is a figure	one with 27 ciphers quite a large number.	8.992586445502077
8977. then i calculated that a	million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator; a billion	peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic; a trillion peas	would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;	and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia.	5.982897178568758
8978. i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at	this rate so i decided to take another measure- the whole state of	pennsylvania.	9.627537709434362
8979. imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania	but instead of snowing snow it snows peas; so we get the whole state	covered with peas about four feet deep.	6.744763121708702
8980. you can imagine what it would	look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against	the houses and covering the cars; pennsylvania thus blanketed would	contain about a quintillion peas.	8.587840515093793
8981. but we still have a long	way to go.	12.519864627587195
8982. next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas	of the entire globe- north america south america europe asia	and africa all covered with peas four feet deep; then we have	sextillion peas.	6.801508868974564
8983. next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole	earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect	250 planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these	with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion.	7.379475958948021
8984. finally we	go into the farthest reaches of the milky way; we get 250000 planets;	we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last	we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.	7.203009146770151
8985. so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are.	10.037226085933773
8986. speck- and space	now although an atom is small we can still in	imagination have a look at it.	8.663700254911687
8987. let us focus on an atom of calcium from	the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow	a magic alice in wonderland growing pill.	7.597663547080582
8988. i start growing rapidly	and this calcium atom grows along with me.	10.136541842658323
8989. i shoot up through the	roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond	the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and	fifty million miles long.	6.645724537595254
8990. then this atom of calcium will swell to something	like a great balloon a hundred yards across a balloon big enough	to put a football field inside.	9.088532295391698
8991. and if you should step inside of such	a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you	would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your	feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.	8.077105957530378
8992. these	balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the	electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action	create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring	atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.	7.917986259499561
8993. since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether	there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom.	10.026621643039654
8994. so you look down	there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head	of a pin.	14.354431816675916
8995. this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus.	13.745400407058032
8996. even if the	atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still	only about the size of a pinhead.	12.900245825613998
8997. it is this atomic nucleus that contains	the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged	electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly all the mass	and the atomic energy.	6.717881285001127
8998. you may ask what else there is and the	answer is nothing- nothing but empty space.	10.498328240900648
8999. and since you are made	of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too.	8.880790881839744
9000. if i could put	your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze	these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge	you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole	was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you	could see on this piece of paper.	10.208562266707903
9001. someone has remarked that this is	certainly the ultimate in reducing.	8.181159883358882
9002. at any rate it shows us how immaterial	we are.	14.232105024746968
9003. now this 1920 view of the	atom was on the whole a discouraging picture.	8.288917944044087
9004. for we believed that the	electrons	obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore	the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics the	whole is no more than the sum of the parts.	8.631470379130413
9005. so if you are made of	atoms you are just a big machine; and since the universe is also made	of atoms it is just a supermachine.	8.079716389746388
9006. and this would mean that we	live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect	bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely	predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit	or human freedom.	10.73387965368769
9007. and this is why so many scientists a half a century	ago were agnostics or atheists.	9.999215675323146
9008. then came the scientific revolution	in the late 1920's.	12.550862197387438
9009. a suggestion from louis de broglie a	physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles	but waves.	6.339293666291469
9010. and to see the meaning of this new picture imagine	that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom	and have a look at it in the way we view it today.	15.325922495014192
9011. now as you step	inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you	see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface	of a pond when you drop a stone into it.	6.735698518033924
9012. these ripples spread	out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral.	9.21003040484368
9013. and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from	the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear	music.	8.57257877457087
9014. it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra	playing a symphony.	13.315641630935536
9015. harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure	are there; and as this music ebbs and flows there is an antiphonal	chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of	the entire universe.	5.3557767254741
9016. and so today when we examine the structure of our	knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude	that the best word to describe our universe is music.	11.675408693298682
9017. the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts	lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state.	8.376419299615904
9018. some of	the island is sand and is not suitable for living.	11.846341503612901
9019. the island folk	have their living almost entirely from summer visitors; the rest is	obtained from harbor scallops.	5.5329301347147934
9020. during about three and a half months	of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland	to the island carrying passengers food and cars; but the	rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland	nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime.	9.938986892515437
9021. this	is a fine trip too on a good day.	10.262807946454558
9022. with martha's vineyard on one	side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about	three hours.	8.755704882912687
9023. to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect	the united states of america in the nineteenth century?	11.754698954709049
9024.  how far	and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging	in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age?	10.549101682927335
9025.  to what	extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political	life and institutions of the country?	7.857118799881864
9026.    a complete picture is	impossible- partly because of the limitations of space partly because	for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian	faith data are unobtainable.	8.741741433131724
9027. even more of an obstacle is the difficulty	of separating the influence of christianity from other factors.	8.653314725335205
9028. although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate	some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at	least one creative factor.	10.550129391915355
9029. at times we can say that it was the major	factor.	16.13006364214808
9030. what in some ways was the most important aspect was the	impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation.	11.826504135304674
9031. as	we have seen a growing proportion although in 1914 still a minority	were members of churches.	6.805696331996166
9032. presumably those who did not have a formal	church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater	or less extent.	10.326139725307142
9033. many of them had once been members of a church	or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or	another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse.	8.57736657877442
9034. the form of christianity	to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of	the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century	immigration; for still others mostly of the nineteenth-century	immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was	eastern orthodoxy.	9.033304193507334
9035. upon all of them played the intellectual social	political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the	nation.	7.422637167283205
9036. upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through	them had had a share in making the individual what he was.	10.0158439955906
9037. yet	to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual	showed the effects of christianity would be impossible.	7.656536878185347
9038. at	best only an approximation could be arrived at.	9.001082994450293
9039. to generalize for the	entire nation would be absurd.	9.455720007798085
9040. for instance we cannot know whether	even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards	of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members	in the population rose.	9.318151160898834
9041. the temptation is to say that as the percentage	of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised	by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general	level.	7.823736417700156
9042. yet this cannot be proved.	14.800496504513374
9043. we know that in the early part	of the century many protestant congregations took positive action	against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority	subscribed.	8.432604055865452
9044. thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance	of charges against their members of drunkenness fighting malicious	gossip lying cheating sexual irregularities gambling horse racing	and failure to pay just debts.	7.331268618263893
9045. if guilty the offender might be excluded	from membership.	8.958205807370456
9046. as church membership burgeoned such measures	faded into desuetude.	11.724091870976082
9047. but whether this was accompanied by a general	lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.	10.640183256256693
9048. what	we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point	out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects	of the life of the nation.	9.530678782372743
9049. we have already hinted at the fashion in	which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life.	9.322033246729303
9050. we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals	of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain	those ideals through reform movements through programmes for bringing	the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards	and through leaders in the government.	12.606064766928275
9051. throughout the	nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american	society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock.	8.470644313973963
9052. by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning	to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals	but also through its attitude towards organized labour.	11.493638909776852
9053. in the twentieth	century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of	the nineteenth-century immigration.	8.885369006550205
9054. the ideals	of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the	older stock.	13.292985728234349
9055. thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic	songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis	smith while a student in andover theological	seminary.	6.469632756953519
9056. with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it	breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals.	10.251278520846633
9057. the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by	the christian faith.	12.35985042672508
9058. here was what was called the american dream namely	the effort to build a structure which would be something new in	history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it.	12.132621541976672
9059. later	in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine	lee bates daughter and granddaughter of new england	congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in	1893 america the beautiful with the words o beautiful	for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom	beat across the wilderness.	5.388495237126969
9060. america america god mend	thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control thy liberty in law	h.	8.258579094939316
9061. o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine	alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears.	7.162739330347597
9062. america america	god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from	sea to shining sea.	8.2015316056709
9063. the american dream was compounded of	many strains.	10.340917336717848
9064. some were clearly of christian origin among them the	great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian	liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of	the land.	7.601016388314115
9065. some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection	as the fountain-head of the american hope.	6.928290705989776
9066. here too must	be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration	emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman.	8.644983642492713
9067. we	must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of	myth- among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder	all of them out of a christian background.	6.575817667574045
9068. with	such a dream arising at least in part from the protestant heritage	of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation	it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete	expression.	10.337133396310273
9069. a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or	remove social ills.	11.807053207272112
9070. significantly the initiation and leadership	of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in	the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of	new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian	congregationalism.	10.26974023087806
9071. several of the movements were given a marked	impetus by revivalism.	9.228025413328078
9072. quakers some from new england had a larger	share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted.	8.009960029638966
9073. we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england	ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter	day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the	american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american	home missionary society the american bible society and new	england theology.	7.585034228782525
9074. the atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence	in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.	12.227699681258535
9075. the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding	to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents	to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the	millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability	cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists.	5.043574925407774
9076. we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind	which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles	and the pietism of the continent of europe- among them prison	reform anti-slavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions	of labour the inner mission and the red cross.	7.695312569552225
9077. we	cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation	of collective ills.	7.654184333497386
9078. a few of the more prominent must serve	as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose.	11.86897946439372
9079. several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the	century.	8.744776694557274
9080. some disappeared with the attainment	of their purpose.	11.102627930595927
9081. still others sprang up late in the century to meet	conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age.	7.36883414569755
9082. anti-slavery movement	the movement to end negro slavery began	before 1815 and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil	war emancipation was achieved.	8.785886975284987
9083. long before 1815 the christian	conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act	accordingly.	6.816835312461095
9084. for example in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting	of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves	and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not	comply.	8.836455803946992
9085. in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian	strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental	congress to abolish slavery.	7.959896016633556
9086. as we have seen methodism early took	a stand against slavery.	13.157110894857553
9087. beginning at least as far back as 1789 various	baptist bodies condemned slavery.	7.971838089974791
9088. after 1815 anti-slavery	sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant	background of the older stock.	9.459510030015343
9089. the nineteenth-century immigration	whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned	for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the	northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out	or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.	5.77612793966322
9090. the anti-slavery movement	took many forms.	7.114084654104681
9091. benjamin lundy a quaker was	a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies.	6.557880096485472
9092. it was	he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison	to the subject.	13.084633349213865
9093. garrison massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage	was by temperament and conviction a reformer.	5.807207516032287
9094. chiefly remembered	because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional	abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among	them women's rights prohibition and justice to the indians.	6.022131677076559
9095. incurably	optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout	baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john	greenleaf whittier he eventually attacked the orthodox	churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery	issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox	and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible.	5.10393212025262
9096. a marked	impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals.	7.833049565288333
9097. finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis	on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of	the anti-slavery campaign.	5.915540544254146
9098. theodore dwight weld was	especially active.	9.363589305390176
9099. weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational	ministers.	8.786305185016182
9100. as a youth he became one of finney's band	of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men.	9.871129965176433
9101. a strong temperance	advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles	stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the anti-slavery	cause.	7.2349329350380644
9102. a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological	seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery	position.	12.977651980486119
9103. the majority then went to the infant oberlin.	10.644025054872957
9104. they and	others employed some of finney's techniques as they sought to win	adherents to the cause.	8.068889522445575
9105. weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions	of such men as joshua r giddings and edwin m stanton	enlisted john quincy adams and helped provide ideas which underlay	harriet beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin.	4.099974493107466
9106. he shunned	publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.	13.586016417272603
9107. wendell phillips	from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens	was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher.	5.734892134194237
9108. although he	later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently	outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian.	9.36745946337479
9109. he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition	but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the	freedmen and for prohibition.	7.079640126200515
9110. the anti-slavery movement and	other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership	and financial undergirding by arthur tappan and his younger	brother lewis tappan.	5.76048083338347
9111. individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power	were transmuted at death into awesome spirits; they were almost immediately	worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities.	4.65518677563441
9112. their	direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also	the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of	the universe.	9.064064751715128
9113. royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly	achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.	6.035134837415636
9114. thus	the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less	puissant ancestors.	8.53678484799813
9115. but this eminence was not without its weighty	responsibilities.	11.164063944538361
9116. since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe	of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for	the benefit of the living.	11.12565846981593
9117. the royal ritual generated power into the	other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the	spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs	of the world.	6.480867368553068
9118. proper ritual observance at any level of society was	capable of generating power for use in the spirit world; but naturally	the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely	powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the	universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.	8.08142944719992
9119. this is the	familiar system of cosmic government.	12.51315986615121
9120. the chinese emperor by	proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers.	9.926232411532684
9121. he regulated	the dualities of light and darkness yang and yin which are	locked in eternal struggle.	7.398666725082809
9122. by swaying the balance between them he	effected the alternation of the seasons.	10.760704358587637
9123. his power was so great that	he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given	ear or been deaf to petitions.	6.384464512067959
9124. in this system no man is exempt	from obligations.	15.588268189140475
9125. failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's	family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid	standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead.	5.164294485575273
9126. and to	offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing	of countrywide disasters.	8.878364919624401
9127. the family home was in fact a temple;	and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in	nature.	7.427498340731885
9128. the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and	in every fear.	12.130766914128056
9129. the common belief was that there existed one	moral order which included everything.	8.345152351497386
9130. the dead controlled the material	prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of	conduct in order not to weaken that control.	10.08532996817878
9131. men believed they could	control nature by obeying a moral code.	6.84213560683905
9132. if the moral code were flouted	the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous	result could be floods plague or famine.	10.131240278974863
9133. modern westerners	have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material	largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the	connection.	6.515046784903595
9134. living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of	village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view	the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only	without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse	effects in his worldly fortunes.	7.011205524896947
9135. basing action on the empirical determination	of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no	powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation	from the constraint of silent burial urns.	5.236167309771599
9136. in china	the magical system par excellence was taoism.	11.546387313909312
9137. the taoists were quietist	mystics who saw an unchanging unity- the tao- underlying	all phenomena.	4.64872747195005
9138. it was this timeless unity that was all-important and	not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality.	12.03028106236694
9139. the taoists	believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation;	in other words they were actually an organization of magicians.	6.024414782044076
9140. mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical	concepts.	11.345375265854715
9141. after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced	into china it underwent extensive changes.	7.856342389141722
9142. during its flowering in	the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package	to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested	philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader.	8.879455987778583
9143. mahayana	had gods and magic a pantheon heavens and hells and gorgeously	appareled priests monks and nuns all of whom wielded power over	souls in the other world.	5.750149962459381
9144. the self-realized mahayana saint possessed	superhuman powers and magic.	8.227504108746977
9145. the mahayana that developed in the	north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world	into a huge magical garden.	6.2108021594295
9146. in its monastic form mahayana was merely	an organization of magic-practicing monks who catered	to the chinese faith in the supernatural.	8.41896074276675
9147. nonmagical confucianism	was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different	orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.	6.417294856298913
9148. confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.	10.607860289905773
9149. if a man lived a classical life he need not fear the spirits- for	only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him.	7.345359232194953
9150. but let us not be	mistaken about confucian virtue; this was not virtue as we	understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief	in magic manipulation.	9.862840024096322
9151. to the confucian virtue simply meant	mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual	and three thousand minor ones.	6.940563771523749
9152. propriety was synonymous with ritual	observance the mark of a true gentleman.	8.935075235374413
9153. to live correctly in an	interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive	for man's fate.	6.450984405179288
9154. this in brief was the historical background	out of which zen emerged.	11.563937469340683
9155. promoters of zen to the west record	its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of	taoism and indian mahayana buddhism.	7.373770972760217
9156. but the marvelous person	that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality	than indian speculation- he possesses magical powers and can	use them to order nature and to redeem souls.	8.143849607311598
9157. proponents of zen to	the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism	in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist	ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic.	5.753584422198943
9158. but in the chinese	mind there was little difference between the two- the bonzes	were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.	9.535214643543712
9159. actually	zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism.	7.5364971053181495
9160. the ch'an sect may have derived its metaphysic from	mahayana but its psychology was pure early taoist.	7.05755373251119
9161. this is well	evidenced	by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen: the idea of	the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and	perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness- a	union with the infinite with the tao- could be effected.	5.061374615677127
9162. in fact	the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so	uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature	of taoism.	8.646801086495138
9163. so too was the insistence on the relativity of the	external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by	consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by	pure indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating	consciousness.	5.6187504889104565
9164. zen maintains that cognitive things	are only the surface of experience.	10.242090405005401
9165. one of its features attractive	to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred	texts.	9.086763124624916
9166. one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures	for use in an outhouse.	12.573233229814829
9167. but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom	of action for which the westerner mistakes it.	10.606262560318447
9168. it is simply that	in taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms- books words	or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness	are considered only the surface of experience.	9.208423395808703
9169. the truth- the	eternal truth- is not transmittable by words.	4.752267283625065
9170. reality is considered	not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but	a positive handicap.	9.365253173231224
9171. the technique of reality confusion- the use of	paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality- originated	with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism: the	koan is not basically a new device.	4.310600556696363
9172. it is important for an	understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of	the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man.	14.008278492860553
9173. in the supernatural	atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever	concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature: popular religion	aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers.	5.630256389543487
9174. and this is only	natural- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest	wonder drug.	9.448082249218624
9175. early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed	at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being	achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence.	6.150650971640338
9176. but	this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.	10.28939887735327
9177. the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world	of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.	8.526895976397276
9178. thus the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was	distilled down to a bare self-seeking and for this reason the mystic	in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation.	8.176224257860888
9179. as the zen	literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in	seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.	8.990744183412044
9180. the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed	ability to perform miracles.	10.269142465228601
9181. exponents of zen often insist	that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism	of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of	the universe.	5.264044338700743
9182. in support of this stories from the early literature are	cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power.	12.73362590562246
9183. but	actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters	were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of	popular credulity: hwang pah one day going up mount	tien tai h which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats	with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.	5.82402473657954
9184. they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while	until they came to a river roaring with torrent.	11.506151962596805
9185. there being no bridge	the master had to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed	the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow	him.	6.839791448508005
9186. thereupon hwang pah said: if i knew thou art an arhat	i would have doubled you up before thou got over there! the monk	then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised	him as a true mahayanist.	6.111874917737688
9187. a second tale shows still	more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess:	on one occasion yang shan saw a stranger monk flying	through the air.	5.582247820392485
9188. when that monk came down and approached him with a	respectful salutation he asked: where art thou from?	8.27874362917479
9189.  early	this morning replied the other i set out from india.	7.448745605328924
9190. why said the teacher art thou so late?	11.709870588347291
9191.  i stopped	responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries.	9.952358243755873
9192. thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan	yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me.	8.396929125832784
9193. then	the monk praised yang shan saying: i have come over to china	in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya	and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india	went back through the air.	4.979568574160275
9194. in the popular chinese	mind ch'an was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that	dominated.	11.204220783862368
9195. a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical	carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes.	7.337813402333589
9196. to the	zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings	who have to be appeased.	10.637112138819061
9197. part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists	in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings.	10.301660332346263
9198. modern zen presentation	to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian highly pragmatic	nature of the zen belief- scriptures are burned to make fire	action is based on direct self-confidence and so on.	6.090454782202668
9199. this picture	of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such	zendo formulas as: o you demons and other spiritual beings	i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters	of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith.	6.262811825208333
9200. pope leo 13 on the 13th day of december 1898 granted	the following indulgences: an indulgence of three hundred days is	granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a	quarter of an hour.	7.688030514510616
9201. a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions	is granted once a month for the daily reading.	8.1051440026588
9202. pope pius the sixth	at rome in april 1778 wrote the following: the faithful	should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures: for these	are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone	to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate	errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times.	6.8020138767419756
9203. the	american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore	urged the catholic people to read the holy bible.	6.5737200166281475
9204. we hope	they said that no family can be found amongst us without a	correct version of the holy scriptures.	11.928239397891096
9205. they recommended also	that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night	prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures.	7.166789155890907
9206. since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred	scriptures be read the following taken from the holy bible	will prove a means of grace and a source of great	spiritual blessing.	9.832006694176156
9207. do not wonder that	i said to thee you must be born again.	14.446202183650264
9208. but as the one	who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior; for	it is written you shall be holy because i am holy.	9.001469370491778
9209. 1 st peter	1:15 16.	9.978719506613569
9210. holiness without which no man will see god.	10.433617807555512
9211. as it is written there is not one just man; there is none	who understands; there is none who seeks after god.	7.183604455976938
9212. all have gone	astray together; h all have sinned and have need of the glory of	the new birth is necessary because the	therefore as through	one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death	has passed unto all men because all have sinned.	9.132187643056536
9213. you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins.	9.473491282314532
9214. and if our gospel also is veiled it is veiled	only to those who are perishing.	12.86110695267224
9215. in their case the god of this	world satan has blinded their unbelieving minds that they should	not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image	of god.	8.920866448276348
9216. for his workmanship	the new birth	is effected through the word of god	not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible through the word of	god.	10.995608430215977

9218. amen amen	i say to thee unless a man be born again of water symbol of the	word of god see ephesians 5:26 and the spirit he cannot enter	into the kingdom of god.	10.99186788693637

9222. whoever is born of god does not commit sin that is he does not	practice sin.	13.410833701915516
9223. cf 1 st john 2:1.	8.23588908253068
9224. we know that no one who is born of god commits sin.	25.240956120226873

9246. to have christ dwelling through	the new birth is miraculous	and mysterious.	12.609211121506988

9251. you may be very religious a good church member an upright honest	and sincere person; you may be baptized confirmed reverent and worshipful;	you may attend mass do penance say prayers and zealously	keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may have	the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost	and headed for hell and eternal punishment.	5.418923136654928

9262. finally men arrested	him gave him a mock trial flogged him nailed him on a cross	and hung him between earth and heaven; and god allowed it.	7.285360941570278

9271. he has said behold i stand at the door	and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door i will	come in to him and will sup with him and he with me	.	7.488973420577067

9273. the latch is on your side of the	door.	9.40875058315397
9274. the choice is yours: the revellings and banquetings of this	world or quiet communion with god; the ever burning lusts of the flesh	or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline.	6.802679969633205
9275. the choice is	yours: god is in your hands now.	9.389093204187164
9276. god has already set	the day when you will be in his hands.	13.183810128609009
9277. what he does with you then	depends on what you do with him now.	11.212600478816071
9278. then it will be	a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god if you	have abused him in your hands.	13.488022617138201
9279. i am a magazine; my name is guideposts; this issue that you are	reading marks my 15th anniversary.	6.130838411629601
9280. when i came into being 15	years ago i had one primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere	to know god better and through knowing him better to become happier	and more effective people.	8.61470445338218
9281. that purpose has never changed.	11.878923777009481
9282. when you read me you are holding in your hands the product of many	minds and hearts.	13.612761159934218

9287. fifteen	years ago there were no guideposts at all.	8.683832601523163
9288. this month a million	guideposts will circulate all over the world.	12.744757542873527
9289. experts in the publishing	field consider this astounding.	9.263800958982252
9290. they do not understand how a small	magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved	such a following.	10.585127971024722
9291. to me the explanation is very simple.	11.723588965424243
9292. i	am not doing anything of myself.	11.068974312406734
9293. i am merely a channel for h something.	10.583230368312652
9294. what is this something?	20.959248209038968
9295.  i cannot define it fully.	13.228146649973242
9296. it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even	when they turn away from it.	14.94964550546244
9297. it is the power that holds the stars in	their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass.	11.438630247369604
9298. it is the	whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is.	19.287391205324976
9299. it	is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace.	6.8503747150135315
9300. all things are possible to god but he chooses- usually- to	work through people.	8.408249013762545
9301. sometimes such people sense that they are being	used; sometimes not.	7.748581688624408
9302. fifteen years ago troubled by the rising	tide of materialism in the post-war world a businessman and a minister	asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine	in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set	forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power	of faith to solve the endless problems of living.	8.424644004860887
9303. the businessman	was raymond thornburg.	10.066512312380592
9304. the minister was norman vincent peale.	12.771762721521954
9305. neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their	idea.	8.495439246054492
9306. they borrowed a typewriter raised about $2000 in contributions	hired a secretary persuaded a couple of young men to join them for	almost no pay h and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets	that they called guideposts.	7.916084732982535
9307. compared to the big established	magazines my first efforts seemed feeble indeed.	7.348962943962562
9308. but from the	start they had two important ingredients: sincerity and realism.	9.759544684493095
9309. the	people who told the stories were sincere.	9.465748483408582

9367. havana was filled with an excitement which you could see	in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices.	5.581784944391521
9368. the hated dictator batista had fled.	12.625942258648605
9369. rumors flew from lip to lip	that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains	where he had fought batista for five years.	6.943336614138188
9370. already the city was	filled with barbudos the bearded war-dirty revolutionaries carrying	carbines waving to the crowds that lined the prado.	7.089365772018398
9371. and	then castro himself did come bearded smiling; yet if you looked closely	you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips.	5.357696917977022
9372. at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper	behind this man.	12.470811151239563
9373. i am sure that castro was happy too about that support.	11.788104592681364
9374. diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper	in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.	9.246046557443027
9375. my	grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials.	8.215900301975548
9376. my own earliest	memories are of exiles: my three brothers and i were taken often	to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed	on to fight the dictator machado.	8.197721971176732
9377. when it was my turn i too	printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see	his regime topple.	8.846843360894798
9378. none of us was aware that the biggest fight was	still ahead.	12.16252444511544
9379. i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana.	9.863752208312343
9380. within a week however i began to suspect that something was	wrong.	14.290805394445671
9381. for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred.	8.227360915731298
9382. he spent	long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge.	10.970912420348727
9383. he	showed us how he dealt with his enemies: he executed them before	tv cameras.	5.136307557896072
9384. on home sets children were watching the death throes	of men who were shot before the paredon the firing wall.	11.455897058029295
9385. castro's	reforms?	12.348350321510317
9386.  he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance.	14.150920715503824
9387. new	schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation: any	academic degree earned during batista's regime was invalid.	4.302475118998296
9388. economic aid?	16.16895044855527
9389.  he had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily he cut	all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator	or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room.	5.881497985666455
9390. under	another law hundreds of farms were seized.	9.578802614687543
9391. farm workers had their wages	cut almost in half.	7.341564506401163
9392. of this only 50 cents a day was paid in cash	the rest in script usable only in people's stores.	9.602668885353404
9393. a	suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist.	7.6457979838704535
9394. in my mind	i began to review: his use of hate to gain support; his people's	courts; his division of society into two classes one the hero	the other the villain.	6.670187313656316
9395. but most disturbing of all were the advisers	he called to sit with him in the palace; many came from communist	countries.	7.388124007228344
9396. what should i do about it i asked myself?	20.22876760910772
9397. 	i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon.	6.294156505226103
9398. there	was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him mobs would appear outside	our windows shouting paredon! paredon! h   what	should i do?	7.640498003922635
9399.  i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario	now: the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors; the thump	and whir of our new presses.	5.430490565880942
9400. here was a powerful ready-made medium	but it could speak only if i told it to.	11.079916943551883
9401. then one day early	in january 1960 i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware	of the crucifix.	7.175674925595347
9402. it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had	given me.	14.532498398277037
9403. i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind	me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner.	9.140540456083288
9404. now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness	in his eyes saying:   you will lose the paper.	8.370827539764296
9405. you may	lose your life.	12.91379123518514
9406. but do you have any choice?	21.60964007629131
9407.    i knew in that	moment that i did not have any choice.	12.474757488559968
9408. from that day on i began	to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in	fidel castro's regime.	10.297706823317336
9409. too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly	either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to lift all	those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth	h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like hey h	lookit mr america h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles	?	4.671070184248602
9410.    after all a guy's gotta	have a little ego!   therefore it's a genuine pleasure	to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had	to train in secret h has never heard one unkind word from his parents	h and never has been taunted by his schoolmates!	this happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new	junior mr canada- henri de courcy.	5.563379475683445
9411. far from discouraging	henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.	7.795788208190538
9412. instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they	personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority	professor roland claude.	10.668249607230269
9413. and they couldn't have entrusted	henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles	from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis	anticus of the leg h and better still he knows just what	exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine	them with for fast fast muscle growth.	5.3260918681166105
9414. that's because the	good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal	health studio which is located at 1821 mt royal east in montreal.	5.70598549507647
9415. undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning	pupils.	10.318418260527704
9416. there's gaetan d'amours who is our newest mr canada	h jean-paul senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago	h jack boissoneault who was with us last month h charles harve	who recently won the most muscular man subdivision award	in the event h and a host of others.	5.3683174829870755
9417. yesiree h	the professor knows his muscles!   now when henri was just	12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds	and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight.	4.287958014571591
9418. about that time	he began reading	and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining.	9.898914422487877
9419. seeing	so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value	of those two wonder-working	weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they	could do for him.	5.836982782286237
9420. well sir h they did real great! for	in almost less time than it takes to tell it henri's bodyweight was	increasing rapidly.	6.6384882489342605
9421. of course he did some exercising h he's crazy	about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction	with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle	on his skinny frame.	5.936242206477553
9422. henri has always had shapely legs from swimming	and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.	6.64182067998425
9423. but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body.	11.247890503635142
9424. it was muscular	but it wasn't symmetrical.	14.229501147317361
9425. a real 'nothing' torso says	henri.	7.247462415092163
9426. it never seemed to widen h it just got longer and longer.	13.891236846712676
9427. that's when he went to professor claude.	4.086759646471645
9428. and at	once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct	it.	10.719964660706804
9429. in his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment	since vic tanny.	9.929877175229654
9430. mr claude is a specialist in torso development	and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull	super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is	a or pushing movement which accents one sector of	a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise	which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.	6.835757912241151
9431. so	right away claude introduced henri to his famous moon bench	and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting	of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover	which dramatically widens the ribcage and	strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest h and the	collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to	build those wide reeves-type gladiator pecs while stimulating	the upper lats and frontal deltoids.	3.985334597249486
9432. as you can see	in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is	vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises h so	the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   now when	henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no 1	the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting	him on four complete push-pull super-sets no 2.	4.849893760965891
9433. super-set	no 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done	with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches.	6.05037224045494
9434. the push	exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done	with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of	the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.	6.7771924833049555
9435. you need the	barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs h the dumbbell	variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs.	6.973892348187097
9436. the pull exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell	bent-arm pullover.	7.461424507248109
9437. the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise	because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation	.	6.163457246870978
9438. in the third push-pull super-set the push	exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars while the pull	exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms.	7.246972223238212
9439. the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage	stretcher ever invented! this is true if a very wide grip	is used and is	achieved.	6.241661337826963
9440. you'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because	your shoulder blades will touch! as you see the professor has designed	a piece of apparatus that the bodybuilder to use	a w-i-d-e grip h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at	all!   but as you can also see it's not a painful exercise	at all because henri de courcy- the happy bodybuilder-	looks as though he were having the time of his life!   the last	exercise of roland claude's prescribed program for henri is a single	exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between	sets.	4.752250296205727
9441. by this time henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area	is pumped-up to almost bursting point and claude takes time to	do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work.	4.564317221469576
9442. he has henri do	from four to six sets of the incline bench press.	11.98712338412006
9443. this gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow	dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the	serratus and lats.	7.020873121450124
9444. this is the kind of chest that invariably	wins contests h that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks	of the great champions.	9.544277048811043
9445. so with four complete push-pull	super-sets no 1 four of no 2 four of no 3 and four to	six sets of the incline bench press you can see that henri de courcy	has had a terrific mass-building muscle-shaping torso-defining	workout that cannot be improved upon.	6.16386485235517
9446. physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone h	rarer still is a mr america or mr universe of true herculean	build.	8.319222889058858
9447. the aspects of physical development that catch the judges'	eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry	and that hallmark of the true champion- superior definition	of the muscles.	5.098089049963679
9448. now good definition is one thing that all of us can	acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workouts.	9.373833960619004
9449. but contest definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every	muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's	chisel- is something quite different.	6.4945940831708695
9450. this comes not alone	from high-set high-rep training but from certain definition-specialization	exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge	of exactly what works best for him.	6.569809696373331
9451. often these exercises	work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.	6.339481573201418
9452. because they are minority exercises and have but a limited	appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten.	11.135740594752564
9453. only	when the newest mr america or mr universe rediscovers	them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and	once again see how effective they really are.	6.002259380594862
9454. the exercise i	shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle	definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the one	leg lunge.	6.837863577097941
9455. why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say	because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has	short or long thigh-bone lengths!   it is the one exercise	that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the-	that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other	bodybuilders h a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable	to judges and audiences alike h the facet of muscular development	that wins prizes.	5.330447966301361
9456. definition of the thighs at the uppermost	part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which	is easily understandable.	9.365332233611866
9457. the one leg lunge is a and	all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.	8.887671285721632
9458. but for	purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular	squatting leg curling leg extensor programs- a heavy weight is	not needed.	6.621230687640965
9459. indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater	more extensive split can be performed.	6.6568277983246515
9460. used in several sets of	high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire	upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look	like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   really	there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way	into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show	why it is so effective:  it's a thigh contraction-extension	exercise.	6.970943737464463
9461. it places terrific tension on	the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition.	8.252302623540324
9462. it	improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps	to make squats more easily and more correctly performed.	6.575030057174068
9463. it	increases flexibility of the legs.	8.063233320957243
9464. it speeds muscle growth	and power development even for the bodybuilder because	each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated	effort to be focused on each.	8.626877279621436
9465. you'll need your weider	power stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's	done:  place your power stands in position and adjust their	height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders	when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean.	5.3445153591168495
9466. place	a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar	; extend your feet forward and	backward until you are in a deep leg split.	6.147762827580929
9467. now raise the weight	by leg without moving your	feet.	7.672677492569425
9468. when the front knee is straight and allow it	to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the	sides of the power stands.	11.355687695719002
9469. after you have taken a breather	the position of your legs so that the thigh	of the and the	thigh now to the and perform the same movement	in the same manner.	7.280725914729994
9470. that's the one-leg lunge in a nutshell.	3.2730311328425863
9471. you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you	make your first	experiments h just for safety.	8.738660034123413
9472. you should also begin	this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed	to it balance-wise.	10.637217918257365
9473. oh you'll wobble and weave quite a bit	at first.	4.77150168628497
9474. before your first training experiment	has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it	you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!	although i suggested that you hold the bar at the of	the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments	with the bar held in of the neck.	6.672873875594712
9475. squat-style lifters and	leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those	variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the	and.	4.555157663039002
9476. the most beautiful bed of pansies i've seen was in a south	dakota yard on a sizzling day.	8.456437089364842
9477. pansies are supposed to like it	cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring	sun.	6.32478307122691
9478. i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce	such beauties in that weather.	12.177376989701845
9479. he seemed puzzled by my question.	12.420996823463023
9480. i just love them he said.	16.673709921474636
9481. the more i talked with him	the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous	blooming.	8.546375759515115
9482. of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.	13.592810142936461
9483. he planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist.	8.53164676196756
9484. these specialists i learned have done a great deal of work to	improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers.	11.77182284305542
9485. their	seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the	unimproved strains.	7.288874684227878
9486. i asked him if he took seeds from his own	plants.	14.585984223962425
9487. occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted	more of he did; but pansy seeds he told me soon run down.	6.305357647739053
9488. it's	best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.	9.240872577175413
9489. his soil was nothing special just prairie land but	he had harrowed in compost until it was loose spongy and brown-black.	6.412668653681395
9490. i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the	right texture tilth and body.	10.888304691039123
9491. it isn't easy to describe it but every	gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.	5.671685612272871
9492. nothing	is easier to grow from seed than pansies.	9.522097199278317
9493. they germinate quickly the	tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily.	8.468748582224197
9494. it doesn't	really matter which month of the year you sow them but they germinate	best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed	by cool in the same 24 hours.	10.195193602903936
9495. i like to make a seedbed	right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold	frames.	9.606248906994661
9496. pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things	rugged with only moderate protection on the coldest days.	5.129592017587089
9497. if you	do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.	10.52640758572996
9498. for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to	encourage rooting.	9.8837191313909
9499. i dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them	down with a fog spray.	6.705788612777889
9500. then i cover the sowing with a board.	12.762239206133598
9501. this	keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds.	7.226011602478922
9502. ants carry away	the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.	10.55849897548702
9503. when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board.	10.249962949390937
9504. a	light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft	during these early days of growth.	8.629668944224099
9505. i like sawdust for this or hay.	12.472954727763453
9506. when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants it's	time to set them out where they are to remain.	10.343067520694802
9507. every time you transplant	a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller.	6.839605733540613
9508. the moral is:	don't transplant it any oftener than you must.	8.109466651590877
9509. as soon as they	are large enough to move i put mine 9 inches apart where they are	to bloom.	8.497447426639528
9510. i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed	bone meal into each hole with the plant.	9.49914439275916
9511. that encourages rooting and	the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers.	7.359240962850052
9512. i doubt if it is possible to overfeed	them.	25.414564814386612
9513. i spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that	decayed manure spread over the bed is fine.	6.09937000184403
9514. one year i simply set the	plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had	been added and i had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my	neighbors' experience.	10.265012017470717
9515. in addition to the rich soil they benefit by	feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak	tea.	9.548241204657922
9516. as a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water	to half the strength in the directions may be used.	12.456908011565416
9517. we put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use	a heavy one.	6.763411106883129
9518. three inches of porous material will do a good job of	keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.	10.59044956967282
9519. when winter comes	be ready with additional mulch.	9.445745002474721
9520. i like hay for this and apply it	so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost.	11.317994031482922
9521. that	keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate	freezing and thawing.	6.2546530694820826
9522. don't miss the pansies that appear	from time to time through the winter.	5.054692535107088
9523. whenever there is a thaw or	a few sunny days you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or	two.	5.556138834952247
9524. if those aren't enough for you why not grow some just for winter	blooming?	8.649235130537814
9525.  the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february	during a particularly cold winter.	7.622114373253738
9526. i started the seed in a flat	in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame.	12.268926987029904
9527. the plants	took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a mat of straw over	the glass to protect them.	6.543185867665928
9528. in response to the lengthening days of february	they budded then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers.	9.374970307229173
9529. that	cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a	border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it.	5.176123800159869
9530. like	strawberries in december pansies are far more exciting in february	than in may.	9.11819713670303
9531. try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold	and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.	5.866160157960891
9532. the day will come in midsummer when you find your plants becoming	leggy running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms.	8.987076322034653
9533. try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby	pin to hold it there.	6.920730721857595
9534. pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and	each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little	plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season.	8.535700321796208
9535. as soon as an experimental	tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from	the mother plant.	8.760840317071594
9536. a second and also good practice is to shear	off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each	branch.	9.282689231820665
9537. these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time	and will behave just as they did in early spring.	6.25286051182794
9538. i like to shear half	my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the	second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.	11.794985992050282
9539. probably	no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to	let the blossoms go to seed.	7.95870233239821
9540. nature's aim different from ours is	to provide for the coming generation.	8.20189877073758
9541. that done her work is accomplished	and she ignores the plant.	8.310816361717869
9542. here is a word of advice when	you go shopping for your pansy seeds.	13.480498770886816
9543. go to a reputable grower preferably	a pansy specialist.	8.347244432830733
9544. it is no harder to raise big healthy blooming	plants than weak sickly little things; in fact it is easier.	11.777390982712847
9545. but	you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.	6.63921364500909
9546. many	people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period	of growth and bloom is over.	10.323311477229684
9547. if the plants are cared	for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific	than the first.	7.787323440632238
9548. would you like to grow exhibition pansies?	19.1985549388795
9549. 	remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest	with the largest buds.	5.90450453231245
9550. the flowers will be huge.	15.510993529830749
9551. they stick to their principles insist upon their	due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it.	6.388725403850729
9552. treat	them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except	the frigid ones.	7.468856827508692
9553. give them food some shade mulch water and more	food and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.	4.8387845328140315
9554. a salad with	greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition	to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special.	8.28961444586244
9555. this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past	thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible	to ship avocado anywhere in the united states.	6.682080135737927
9556. it has a great	many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part	of your diet yet you really should.	9.349507253770195
9557. you will find that avocado	is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted.	9.703629600555029
9558. it is roughly shaped	like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers	a meaty melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe	bartlett pear but oily.	8.181546539210096
9559. the avocado should have a give to it	as you hold it when it is ripe.	9.30547234764038
9560. the flavor is neither sweet like	a pear nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland nut-like.	8.096716831886042
9561. it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not	because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in	the light of our experience with other fruits.	8.620744031457658
9562. sometimes it takes several	eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste	that has made it such a favorite throughout the world.	9.664845885029573
9563. once you become	an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with	eager anticipation.	8.31903995863855
9564. today	refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible	to any place in the world.	9.109118466873236
9565. the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree	but it is still firm at this point.	9.233261777234636
9566. it is brought to packing houses	cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective	excelsior.	14.464219089555959
9567. the fruit is then cooled to 42`f a temperature at which	it lapses into a sort of dormant state.	6.3085622248162965
9568. this cooling does not change	the avocado in any way it just delays the natural softening of	the fruit until a grovelike temperature is restored.	8.986013005698767
9569. this happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.	6.656137715083895
9570. one	of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require	processing of any kind.	12.255848576234051
9571. there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing	needed.	15.080910704552114
9572. if the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay	its ripening until needed.	11.165013342659346
9573. and unlike other fruits one cannot eat	the skin of the avocado.	7.9362751638262266
9574. it is thick much like an egg plant's skin	so that poison sprays if they are used present no hazard to the	consumer.	11.031929901358733
9575. good taste and	versatility	plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend	the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were	limited.	6.743709709621705
9576. avocados however are very rich in nutrients.	10.154700411436544
9577. their main	asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining	the good health of the circulatory system.	7.058898552364253
9578. aside from this	the average portion contains some protein an appreciable amount of vitamins	a and c- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement	and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement.	7.766944295627512
9579. the	b vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin.	6.325842286988224
9580. calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts	and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts.	8.216267342279606
9581. none of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration	storage.	8.916383482783186
9582. dr wilson c grant of the veterans'	administration hospital coral gables florida and the university	of miami school of medicine set out to discover if avocados	because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce	the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients.	7.774330312808009
9583. the study comprised	16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to 72.	8.101577237273405
9584. they were put	on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol	level of their blood.	10.14800675742828
9585. then they were given 12 to 1-12 avocados	per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.	7.679725426624515
9586. five four three two one fire! the tremendous energy	released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than	it can be heard.	6.921296702903492
9587. the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the	pit of your stomach.	7.015596849535438
9588. never before has the introduction of a weapon	caused so much apprehension and fear.	9.24300547119366
9589. nuclear weapons are fearsome	but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless	swiftness which is much more terrifying.	5.839304337207884
9590. a great many writers	are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker	would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear	rockets.	10.031315578753993
9591. it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that	an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously	destroy his opponent's cities and people.	8.692166014430896
9592. with a nation defenseless	before it why would the attacker spare the victim's people?	9.996225653051185
9593. 	wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical	act of complete subjugation?	7.140707811397355
9594.  the nation would be utterly devastated.	22.70558366411829
9595. the will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken.	10.049854920691923
9596. nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction	in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means	to destroy itself in minutes.	8.076290854304215
9597. at this point it should be painfully obvious	that cities being soft and the people within them are ideally	suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.	8.92631537148499
9598. however because	this vulnerability is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side	to destroy the opponent's cities at least so long as the opponent	has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.	9.881020969165926
9599. it should be appallingly	apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.	9.50023673324837
9600. icbms have given us a capability which could be used in	two different ways.	10.474708355496729
9601. they could be used to attack a nation's people		or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military	force.	8.037388642471312
9602. if our national interest lies in being able to	fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must	take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles.	9.779052163255045
9603. we must	determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves.	8.962877588832068
9604. we must make	certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job	to the missile.	11.010854473449903
9605. missiles are very valuable weapons but they	also have their too little known limitations.	6.115926690620146
9606. because of a missile's	ballistic trajectory the location of a fixed target must be	known quite accurately.	10.629681660307803
9607. placing missiles in submarines on barges railroads	highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with	passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range	ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying	a mobile or moving target with such weapons.	5.223098761065582
9608. one must first detect	a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of	destruction select the missile to be fired against the target	compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for	firing.	9.342353064274233
9609. even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously	the icbm still has a time of flight to the target	of about 30 minutes.	7.563175567208017
9610. therefore if the target can significantly change	its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of	having destroyed it is drastically lowered.	10.014182701329037
9611. because of this	it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic	missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile	defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.	5.4243669525821785
9612. in order to destroy the enemy's mobile moving or imprecisely	located strategic forces we must have a hunter-killer capability	in addition to our missiles.	8.375487890404086
9613. until this hunter-killer operation	can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only	means available to us.	6.365510290612763
9614. it seems reasonable that if general	nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's	citizens to cinders we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance	aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and	destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.	9.21178967707189
9615. let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm	force.	9.737038623547454
9616. it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52	or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based	missiles.	8.306587400884665
9617. if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton	nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which	may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would	seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small	nuclear weapons.	6.120589927676191
9618. an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons	could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains	operating within a specified geographic area of russia- provided that	we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia's air defenses	before our bombers got there.	6.535914716213899
9619. the aircraft could be used to destroy	other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as	the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by	missile.	7.315622035304756
9620. why then aren't we planning a larger more important	role for manned military aircraft?	7.368195344019457
9621.  is there any other way to do	the job?	14.424792025446258
9622.    survivability of our strategic forces	mobile and hardened minuteman hardened atlas and titan and airborne	means that it will take some time perhaps weeks to destroy	a strategic force.	7.6359293536850865
9623. war under these circumstances cannot be one	massive exchange of nuclear devastation.	6.629049081709194
9624. forces will survive a surprise	attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration	to the conflict.	7.839000206747846
9625. the forces which survive the initial	attack	must be found and destroyed.	9.016276692772662
9626. even mobile forces must be found and	destroyed.	13.018173498606098
9627. but how does one go about the job of finding and destroying	mobile forces?	9.446328286030496
9628.  they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction	by ballistic missile.	12.435694840856511
9629. some day many years in the future true	spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets.	11.068928503702882
9630. but until	we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer	problem is manned aircraft.	9.990892628265692
9631. however the aircraft which we have	today are tied to large soft airfields.	8.26515619749227
9632. nuclear rockets can	destroy airfields with ease.	11.585180646651713
9633. here then is our problem: aircraft are	vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions	which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield	on which the aircraft is completely dependent is doomed by the missile.	5.6874505292063
9634. this makes today's aircraft a one-shot or one mission weapon.	6.203011301985178
9635. aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.	9.688973626644124
9636. this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft	in favor of the missile.	15.802301239996332
9637. but remember this- it isn't the aircraft	which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets it is the airfield.	4.97654431301383
9638. eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you	have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic	missiles.	9.542434817119712
9639. there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or	eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:    put	aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground.	7.91879217779828
9640. build long-range aircraft which can take off from small	airfields with runways.	7.701403211345507
9641. if we could use all the small airfields	we have in this country we could disperse our strategic aircraft	by a factor of 10 or more.	8.031939529339233
9642. use nuclear propulsions to keep	our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their	useful life.	8.305006319741754
9643. using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines	develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing long-range	military aircraft.	4.820373747454111
9644. we have the technology today with which to	build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 psi.	11.096758961301369
9645. we	could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.	8.327535619095432
9646. large	long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability	to take off from 3000-foot runways but they would require more powerful	engines than we have today.	8.605579623907676
9647. there is little enthusiasm for spending	money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief	that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.	9.350927649020454
9648. this	same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted	in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.	7.506479057753763
9649. one seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for	the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine.	7.823532090645892
9650. if	for some reason such as economy we are not going to develop aircraft	nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency then we should	turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio	of 12 or 15 to one.	8.40170039708808
9651. with powerplants such as these vertical takeoff	and landing combat aircraft could be built.	7.471503838720295
9652. for example a 12-to-one	engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter.	10.41911036440222
9653. with a 15-to-one	engine a supersonic aircraft weighing 300000 pounds could rise	vertically.	6.291142323933859
9654. the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to	develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a	billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft	are obsolete.	7.772604244068623
9655. when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields	they are no longer vulnerable to icbms.	8.611009920623296
9656. if our sac	bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and	because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability	to strike at russia again and again and again those bombers would	unquestionably assure our military dominance.	7.997881498543726
9657. we would have	the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it	were fixed or mobile.	5.7361355635827636
9658. with such a force of manned bombers we could bring	enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be	selective and extremely discriminating.	10.050021078302494
9659. no need to kill an entire city	and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance	to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.	5.375067287616835
9660. our first	necessity at the very outset of war is post-attack reconnaissance.	9.598547402181847
9661. in a few years we will have samos	.	19.390602833949064
9662. but in the case of moving targets and targets which	have limited mobility what will their location be when it is time to	destroy them?	13.974847100191809
9663.  what targets have we successfully knocked out?	10.21913504705754
9664.  a	ballistic missile cannot today tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.	9.81921955722683
9665. what targets still remain to be hit?	10.720663419305119
9666.  these crucial questions	must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.	8.663339560271343
9667. samos will	be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark.	6.814428649336944
9668. even if this is some day possible there remains the 30-minute time	of flight of a missile to its overseas target.	11.4478893561467
9669. if the target can change	its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in	the air on its way the probability of the missile destroying the target	is drastically reduced.	8.377243328912938
9670. pre-attack reconnaissance is vital	but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate	the war favorably.	5.433132710560451
9671. it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather	that post-attack reconnaissance.	11.009942252953635
9672. it could operate under the clouds	and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.	13.641522812663107
9673. it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately	destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile	to come all the way from the united states with the chance that	the target if it were mobile would be gone.	8.769174573281058
9674. a large aircraft	such as the b-52 or b-70 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small	nuclear weapons.	6.622567841346873
9675. few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive	power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 feet.	6.707736949608244
9676. or	put	another way the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed	by placing a one-kiloton warhead	within 100 to 200 feet of the target!	it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large	yield nuclear weapons.	6.611264860851085
9677. today we have side-looking radar which	has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual	buildings runways taxi-ways separate spans of bridges etc.	4.866511690983948
9678. with these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy	military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage	to urban areas.	8.740859585497905
9679. if we fail to develop the means to hunt down	and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision	and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace	our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.	6.082284292751679
9680. the lyric beauties of schubert's trout quintet-	its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source	of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners.	6.16436322061603
9681. but for students of	musical forms and would-be classifiers the work presents its problems.	7.064793664136532
9682. since it requires only five players it would seem to fall into the	category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass an instrument	generally regarded as symphonic.	9.452012246283978
9683. moreover the piece is written	in five movements rather than the conventional four of most quintets	and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.	6.6810305582749745
9684. the	many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize	the dual nature of its writing.	9.253102811824844
9685. some renditions are of symphonic dimensions	with the contrabass given free rein.	6.680096969917555
9686. other interpretations present	the music as an essentially intimate creation.	9.130604398491167
9687. in these readings	the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background or it	is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in	a china shop.	5.789983319692811
9688. recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches	when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer	than ten different performances.	10.119438215476828
9689. the occasion for this marathon:	angel's long-awaited reissue in its great recordings of the	century series of the schnabel-pro arte version.	5.135686476850478
9690. let me say at	the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as	it did on the first.	10.157533327328691
9691. whether considered alone or in relation	to other editions colh 40 is a document of prime importance.	6.228717285688636
9692. artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart	players of all time and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable.	10.77831013931268
9693. but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great	performer and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to	are by schnabel pupils	also sheds light on the master's pedagogical	skills.	8.490106292568957
9694. certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian	renditions most notably the schnabel trill	.	8.406112884793169
9695. but the most impressive testimony to schnabel's distinction	as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each	student's approach as distinctly his own.	5.385347665537283
9696. schnabel's emphasis	on structural clarity his innate rhythmic vibrancy and impetuous	intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one.	6.236068008911599
9697. yet no	detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a	result the playing here has humor delicacy and radiant humanity.	7.224615195381191
9698. this	is a serious-minded interpretation but it is never strait-laced.	11.29935977487648
9699. and	although schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement it is meticulously	faithful to schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.	3.9166837218425212
9700. the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands	a search for superlatives.	11.159385779873961
9701. about the pro arte's contribution	i am less happy.	6.976209325401599
9702. i for one rather regret that schnabel didn't	collaborate with the budapest quartet whose rugged athletic	playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook	than the style of the belgian group.	7.990768575027582
9703. from a technical standpoint	the string playing is good but the pro arte people fail to enter	into the spirit of things here.	8.75286898828431
9704. the violinist in particular is very	indulgent with swoops and slides and his tone is pinched and edgy.	9.680508596426925
9705. the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone	but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very	quiet.	6.740630661897704
9706. there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation	in the forellen movement and i suspect that this is	due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original sps.	11.84638527265793
9707. turning to the more modern versions curzon's offers	the most sophisticated keyboard work.	6.3899902835737885
9708. every detail in his interpretation	has been beautifully thought out and of these i would especially	cite the delicious la^ndler touch the pianist brings to the fifth	variation	and the gossamer shading throughout.	7.370654818680955
9709. some of curzon's	playing strikes me as finicky however.	8.26739469256705
9710. why for example does he favor	two tempos rather than one for the third movement?	11.511302143523805
9711.  the assisting	musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise	but their contribution is rustic and appealing.	6.292707304630672
9712. to the double bass playing of johann krumpp: his scrawny	the glazer-fine arts edition is a model of lucidity	and organization.	7.201008442471844
9713. it is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble	effort.	13.987926306621489
9714. but having lived with the disc for some time now i find	the performance less exciting than either schnabel's or fleisher's	and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon's.	8.690693460407507
9715. aeschbacher's work is very much akin to schnabel's but the sound	on his decca disc is dated and you will have a hard time locating	a copy of it.	6.149922192690691
9716. the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet	and victor babin-festival quartet editions	give us superlative string playing crippled	by unimaginative piano playing.	5.609289111146478
9717. badura-skoda-vienna	konzerthaus and demus-schubert quartet	are both warm-toned pleasantly lyrical	but rather slack and tensionless.	3.323924216432795
9718. helmut roloff playing with a group	of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble gives a sturdy reading in	much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists.	7.992055418541732
9719. telefunken	has accorded him beautiful sound and this bargain-priced disc	is worthy of consideration.	5.088155380235393
9720. returning once again	to the schnabel reissue i am beguiled anew by the magnificence	of this pianist's musical penetration.	7.195019879290872
9721. here is truly a great recording	of the century and its greatness is by no means diminished	by the fact that it is not quite perfect.	11.850929050379127
9722. this recording surely belongs	in everyone's collection.	9.948598755157963
9723. must records always sound like records?	8.474032507650639
9724.    from the beginning	of commercial recording new discs purported to be indistinguishable	from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation.	9.435473961458575
9725. seen	in perspective many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.	7.194584275473867
9726. although lacking absolute verisimilitude they supply the	ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation	of the original.	8.181027351485236
9727. on the basis of what they give us we can know how the	young caruso sang appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal	under karl muck's baton or sense the type of ensemble toscanini	created in his years with the new york philharmonic.	7.2062239893607805
9728. since	the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago	the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold.	8.515311045954887
9729. in many	cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational	effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning	as the gap between sound and substance became clearer.	6.422517598615624
9730. other	innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing	to acquire in time the status of classics.	8.77650806898038
9731. if we return to them today	we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them	still pleasing.	8.183552607619564
9732. records sound like records because they provide	a different sort of experience than live music.	11.567737787171794
9733. this difference is	made up of many factors.	10.050192692400612
9734. some of them are obvious such as the fact	that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior	in different types of environments and social settings.	10.593140941851427
9735. sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something	from the technical standpoint	records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey	the true color texture complexity range intensity pulse and pitch	of the original.	5.708307956401126
9736. any alteration of one of these factors is distortion	although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced	that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.	10.232691756767348
9737. yet it is the accumulation of distortion the fitting together of	fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness	that makes records sound like records.	8.26245768369914
9738. the sound may be good;	but if you know the real thing you know that what you are hearing	is only a clever imitation.	10.549630789023002
9739. command's new brahms second is	a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather	than a copy of one.	5.617407047449131
9740. like the recent scheherazade from london	it is successful because emphasis	has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than	on creating sensational effects.	8.303763657915603
9741. because of this only those with	truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the	engineers' triumph.	9.645301496157
9742. the easiest way to describe this release	is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg	performance with minimal alteration of its musical values.	10.158573974631175
9743. the engineering	as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness.	7.538474561709924
9744. the effect of	the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis	exactly what you would expect from a live performance.	9.832026091895965
9745. this absence of	peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity but	it eliminates listener fatigue.	5.25957520540939
9746. a contributing factor is the perspective	the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.	10.090796474030672
9747. the orchestra	is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes valve	clicks and other noises incidental to playing.	6.570072223789582
9748. yet you feel the orchestra	is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm	presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically	perfect hall.	10.60866379240978
9749. command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation.	9.578883012065875
9750. the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its	full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer.	8.289997820286626
9751. the	timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.	8.525205951531897
9752. all of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked	authority and musical distinction.	14.06772903408318
9753. for me it has more of both elements	than the majority of its competitors.	11.046715036979943
9754. steinberg seems to have gone	directly back to the score discounting tradition and has built his	performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly	what brahms set down on paper.	9.38432161155639
9755. those accustomed to broader	more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react	strongly when they hear this one.	8.047470748154383
9756. without losing the distinctive undertow	of brahmsian rhythm the pacing is firm and the over-all performance	has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.	7.080150826600271
9757. the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is	taken literally and may shock you as the real allegro con spirito	of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet.	6.844535707370509
9758. in the end however	the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way	it sings.	13.84226966775834
9759. steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element	which must dominate in this score and he manages at times to create	the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.	7.367357809235998
9760. the	engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result.	10.392550455915513
9761. too	many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody	and its accompaniment.	6.9320275461760685
9762. the command technique invites you to listen	to the depth of the orchestration.	12.24178148786244
9763. your ear takes you into the ensemble	and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously	were apparent only in the score.	7.223164075250053
9764. it is this sort of experience	that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance	for the home music listener.	14.748921984561349
9765. the first substantially complete stereo giselle	of its scope since feyer's four-sided lp edition of 1958 for	this set is i'm afraid likely to provide more horrid fascination	than enjoyment.	4.458613052548094
9766. the already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve	music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts	between ultravehement brute power and chilly if suave sentimentality.	5.891784608697079
9767. and in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic	impact and earsplitting brilliance the recording sounds as though	it had been doctored for super-high fidelity.	5.456235292445792
9768. the home listener	is overpowered all right but the experience is a far from pleasant	one.	12.62695396872368
9769. as with the penultimate giselle release	i find the cleaner less razor-edged	monophonic	version for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness the more	aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects	in my sd copies.	5.53162073692884
9770. at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden	new york on the second day the finals of the junior class	brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class.	11.125340057017242
9771. the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far	south as kentucky.	8.134242828330407
9772. this year several entries from canada were entered	which made the junior class international.	13.798336279827353
9773. forty-six of	the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present.	5.5176133547403685
9774. it was interesting	to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other	classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class.	13.56651002952267
9775. as has been the custom for the past several years john cross	jr bench show chmn of westminster arranged for the juniors'	meeting before the class and invited two speakers from the dog	world to address them.	6.572630137924418
9776. over 60 juniors parents and guests attended.	11.916569614024683

9778. in her opening remarks mrs long also	welcomed the juniors and stated there isn't any other show quite	like westminster.	7.418649029276325
9779. i know because this is my 37th year with hardly	a break.	8.98432015648077
9780. mrs long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster	which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably	will not appreciate in full for a number of years.	9.08209721067052
9781. twenty	years ago her daughter betsey long then 13 years of age won the	grand challenge trophy children's handling class	at westminster.	5.354982592632623
9782. no sooner had betsey come out of the	ring than mrs long walked into the working competition with	ch cadet or noranda another home-bred product and won!	speaking from long years of experience mrs long advised the juniors:	when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement	stop! dogs have a way of sensing our feelings! when you and	your dog step into the junior ring it should be just what the dog	wants to do as much as what you want him to do.	7.1785007419653715
9783. if you walk into the	ring because it is fun to show your dog he will feel it and give you	a good performance! he knows your signals what is expected of him	and the way the class is conducted right up through the flash-bulbs	of the photographers.	7.28075716848287
9784. take	away your attitude said mrs long and what have you left?	11.014952203900185
9785. 	either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign	that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! or a	bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe	the way you look or the date you have after the class or you are just	doing this to please the parents.	4.972704975375399
9786. the reason you are in	the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most	attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can	produce.	9.66177982309013
9787. aids sounds more like a pony club or horsemanship classes-	riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   your	aids are your attitude which comes through your voice your hands	and legs- voice to encourage discourage or whatever the need may	be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of	speed.	4.162151146679539
9788. without right attitude the other aids just do not work right.	10.305371573820977
9789. mrs long wished all the juniors luck in the class and	stated have fun! and may you all continue to show at westminster	in the years to come!	the	second speaker was harvey barcus president of the dog writers	ass'n of america.	5.805166825317877
9790. mr barcus spoke on the subject of	scholarships for juniors- with which he is very familiar.	11.051843762881834
9791. last year	a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing	ass'n scholarship which is worth $10000.	6.104392747925005
9792. he gave a resume of	the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.	12.19871669372916
9793. junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and	should be earnestly encouraged! is one of mr barcus' strong	beliefs.	5.655540462171231
9794. he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should	take a more active part in encouraging the junior division!	in closing mr barcus also wished all the juniors	luck in their class.	9.097897234140962
9795. instead of 3 am	in the past the juniors class at westminster was held at 4:45	pm.	9.443836313915828
9796. this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the	show- a great advantage to them!   before the juniors entered	the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved	their dogs around the ring and set them up they could relax with their	dogs.	7.807578234669005
9797. from there on each junior was going to be judged individually.	12.04784404005716
9798. this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the	class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour	45 minutes to judge the class.	10.005191578478525
9799. this year anne hone rogers outstanding handler judged the	class.	8.744966764080615

9805. many	it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select	4 winners from the 46 juniors entered.	6.014766291306583
9806. a large number of these juniors	have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.	12.902777324719427
9807. after the judge moved all the dogs individually she selected	several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring.	10.214840920490367

9823. for some time this writer has been suggesting	a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years	of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class.	7.544844779734366
9824. such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc	show recently.	10.795570966860545
9825. not only were the contestants pleased with the class	but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day.	8.6277829365277
9826. the intermediates	in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners	and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice	of the judge.	8.461757768792616

9830. juniors who attend this chicago show	should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help	to them.	10.40975447053669
9831. superintendents	at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed	handler to judge junior showmanship competition.	7.1014789361590305
9832. the founder of	the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby sr	was an outstanding	handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit	in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division.	9.677708415992855
9833. some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew	nothing of what was required of a junior's ability to show a dog.	7.123059067700841
9834. to	overcome this unfair judging the akc requires that a licensed	handler be present to judge the class.	9.0152519585217
9835. if the superintendents	do not receive more cooperation from handlers it has been suggested	that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class.	7.236632344545543
9836. by recognizing	and helping juniors get interested in the dog world all will	be helping to create future dog owners.	9.97583812018683

9847. in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!	many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again- has remembered	us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.	5.032007431852307
9848. so many times i have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the	table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination.	9.977211809683313
9849. is it that they don't care?	8.430601395372443
9850.  are they indifferent to the	fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?	10.785582179357466
9851. 	at one time to most americans unless they were fortunate	enough to live near a body of navigable water boats were considered	the sole concern of fishermen rich people and the united states	navy.	6.77214897711941
9852. today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening	statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport.	9.463722617264557
9853. there	are more than 8000000 recreational boats in use in the united states	with almost 10000000 the prediction for within the next decade.	7.906669273238655
9854. about 40000000 people participated in boating in 1960.	11.154494860640455
9855. boating has	become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining	sea.	6.121596753812847
9856. boats are operated in every state in the union with the heaviest	concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west.	13.27923576855036
9857. the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident	expectedly in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural	lakes rivers and along the nation's coastline.	5.0450266033165185
9858. but during the	last several years boats were launched in areas where a short time	ago the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for	livestock.	11.33038165042022
9859. developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources	control program of the government vast man-made bodies of water represent	a kind of glorious fringe benefit providing boating and fishing	havens all over the country.	6.618740630689559
9860. no matter how determined or wealthy	boating lovers of the southwest had been for example they could	never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake	texoma located between texas and oklahoma which resulted when the	corp of army engineers dammed the red river.	8.028780218982833
9861. in 1959 according	to the engineers lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial	lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1000000	persons.	7.515185405404387
9862. where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been	created by bringing bodies of water to the people means have been found	to take the people and their boats to the water.	10.73860295036725
9863. providing these	means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1800000	boat trailers now in use.	5.875846779589533
9864. it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty	or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new light strong	easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any	kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2000.	8.139028926115785
9865. the sight of	sleek	inboards outboards and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways	many miles from any water is commonplace.	6.017994695748178
9866. boatmen lucky enough	to have facilities for year 'round anchorage for their craft	will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car	driving to the water	and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to	the boat.	6.100159483564204
9867. today the boat on its trailer is brought to the gear and	loaded at the door.	9.497654835332286
9868. arriving at the waterside the boat is launched	the family taken aboard and that easily another day afloat is begun.	8.42584906554853
9869. and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be	ten years ago.	8.192637780750529
9870. this year americans will discover previously unheard	of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred	of our nation's national regional and local boat shows.	7.677159722737324
9871. the boats	of america's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as	they are hauled to new horizons.	5.4575714217362465
9872. the variety of craft on the	country's waters today is overwhelming.	9.358348826676542
9873. they range from an eight-foot	pram which you can build yourself for less than $50 to auxiliary	sailboats which can cost over $100000.	6.0088787832635555
9874. boat prices vary according to	the buyer's desires or needs.	6.833805534598624
9875. in this respect boats can be compared	with houses.	12.177137712693318
9876. there is no limit to what you can spend yet it is easily	possible to keep within a set budget.	18.330488738073093
9877. there is no question as to	just what is available.	16.177343879649836
9878. you name it our industry is producing it and	it probably is made in different models.	10.931433829444506
9879. there are canoes ideal	for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips.	9.377322835952405
9880. there are	houseboats which are literally homes afloat accommodating whole families	in comfort and convenience.	10.510810484135309
9881. you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped	craft sail power or both or laze away a fine day in a small	dinghy on a local pond.	7.030768714959885
9882. you may have your boat of wood canvas	plywood plastic or metal.	14.450833856447266
9883. you may order utility models inboard or	outboard with or without toilets galleys and bunks.	8.057602995536643
9884. you may dress	it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.	12.07459139677694
9885. designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers	who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena	lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month	ride around the block to the sportiest boatman who insists on all	the dash color flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.	6.1466582660770905
9886. you pay your money and you take your choice.	14.140236117976547
9887. american technology	in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful	interest in american boating.	6.952426393015911
9888. i wonder if anyone ever bothered	to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors americans	excel over any country in the world in the long run.	13.282339958867786
9889. russia	whose technology is not quite primitive is still in the dark ages	when it comes to improving the outboard motor for instance.	7.384664019233596
9890. now	here is truly a marvel.	11.777434545327575
9891. the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal	range of one to 80 horsepower unheard of a few years ago for a two	cycle engine in quantity production.	8.53249706836177
9892. these engines can be removed	from a boat with relative ease wherein lies their greatest advantage.	9.032070398052316
9893. their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook the	range being about $150 to $1000 depending on size.	5.48917132991435
9894. great	thought	has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population	of the country; and to making the owning of a boat simpler.	7.6288968466419105
9895. there	was a time when if a man wanted to purchase a boat it was necessary	for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he	could touch the tiller or wheel.	8.594783282314799
9896. having a boat financed through a local	bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.	10.288939018728692
9897. marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer	areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.	5.32066332019574
9898. terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down	payments run about the same as for automobiles.	13.676934980471595
9899. of course individual	financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning	power credit rating and local bank policy.	6.8792436102476895
9900. outboard motors	insurance and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as	boats.	11.093945511031139
9901. terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those	for home appliances.	7.148410009283845
9902. when the automobile was in its embryonic	stage such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit	understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about	the only rule governing where when and how fast a car could go.	7.913301946392831
9903. when	air travel was in its infancy the sky was considered big enough and	high enough for all.	6.445739942726038
9904. man had enough to worry about managing to get	up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft.	10.709526843295869
9905. it was	much the same with pleasure boating at first.	11.199268716295476
9906. come one come all the	water's fine!   as the ungoverned days of the automobile	and the airplane are long since relegated to the past so is the carefree	attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do; must and should	do.	7.128663586149037
9907. however there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.	12.250904639854129
9908. laws on boating vary according to the state in which the	craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.	14.2084284618207
9909. what may be acceptable	in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line.	7.524535125505599
9910. the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according	to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally	used.	14.54270733628881
9911. if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure	boats you must apply for a number from the us coast guard for	any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower	before it can be used on federal waterways.	8.407119173162478
9912. state numbering	laws differ from each other in many ways.	13.712622810651489
9913. fees are not the	same	and some states do not require certain craft such as sailboats with	no power to be registered at all.	6.202205061657077
9914. many states have laws regulating	the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age	of motor boat operators.	9.091403922559458
9915. generally states reserve for communities	the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.	6.839755487123469
9916. it is always wise to consult your marine dealer local yacht	or boat club secretary or local law enforcement officers if you are	not positive what the regulations are.	9.728264048629928
9917. ignorance of the law is no better	excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common	sense can lead to just as much tragedy.	7.806571237973955
9918. hand in hand with	the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed	safety program.	8.169713316770688
9919. foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the	rapid growth of the sport the industry has been supporting an intense	coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.	6.3589609422379745
9920. a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the	enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers.	14.373820580245663
9921. the industry	has been its own watch dog.	9.012142500199987
9922. with us coast guard cooperation	the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended	practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference	to safety.	10.217514617742086
9923. industry interest in safety goes even farther.	8.471888120188146
9924. in 1959 the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national	association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance	underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service	for boats and their equipment.	9.635934815469088
9925. a new waterfront site for the bureau	is now being built at atlantic city new jersey to provide the	most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the	sport safe.	6.151514858299864
9926. in addition to these activities the naebm	with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue new york city as well	as other associations and individual manufacturers provide and distribute	films booklets and public services in regard to proper boat handling	and safety afloat.	9.863959065250068
9927. it is important to note the work of	the united states power squadrons and the us coast guard	auxiliary.	13.426218593307436
9928. each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in	seamanship piloting and small boat handling.	9.674566638986063
9929. these are not governmentally	subsidized organizations.	11.58826176322441
9930. this year over 100000 persons will	receive this free instruction.	12.986638283293576
9931. as america on wheels was responsible	for an industry of motor courts motels and drive-in establishments	where you can dine see a movie shop or make a bank deposit	the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries	designed especially to accommodate them.	4.686659200183336
9932. instead of motels for	the boatman there are marinas.	14.428167492614126
9933. the word marina was coined by	naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational	boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative	comfort.	6.324174796063423
9934. currently marina is used to indicate a municipal or	commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome	or all of the following available: gasoline fresh water electricity	telephone service ice repair facilities restaurants sleeping	accommodations a general store and a grocery store.	7.277071930122898
9935. yachtel	a relatively new word indicates a waterfront type of hotel where	a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises	as well as other services.	5.95991214348903
9936. boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.	9.712633247920438
9937. it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically	to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as	outboards.	8.351609445076955
9938. regardless of nomenclature yachtels and boatels are marinas.	9.95503401492203
9939. boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities	may rightfully be called marinas.	7.786865042300328
9940. a recent survey disclosed there	are about 4000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and	boatyards in the united states the majority of which are equipped	to handle outboard boats.	10.390782032799954
9941. the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical	puzzle but once understood the principles can be applied to	any track and signal arrangement.	7.728379271320698
9942. in the frame are two sets of bars	which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous	moves.	14.309166159690621
9943. the main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet	is connected to each lever.	8.022093873060083
9944. if the lever is pulled to clear a signal	or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at	the same time.	10.29367956434749
9945. close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking	bars.	10.918336969010891
9946. these can also move a short distance but at right angles	to the tappets.	10.75297308364297
9947. the number of locking bars required depends on how many	false moves must be prevented.	9.55752178243047
9948. in the sides of the tappets	are notches with sloping sides and connection between the tappets and	locking bars consist of cams called dogs.	10.449084170588009
9949. two or more dogs are	mounted on each locking bar.	8.723289982282555
9950. these slide into and out of the notches	in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and unlocking them.	11.079978277137874
9951. here's how the scheme works: suppose the operator pulls	the lever to clear a particular signal.	4.148351416625082
9952. this also pulls the tappet connected	to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches	to the side thus moving one or more locking bars.	8.447197289232392
9953. the dogs on the	other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other	tappets.	8.37597188830024
9954. by this scheme pulling one signal to clear locks all the	other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal	is again restored to normal.	8.416169315120257
9955. interlocking signals are normally	at stop or red position and a lever must be pulled to clear	the signal.	6.232758089210192
9956. this is not necessarily to green however for in	some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it	into the plant.	11.983469410955042
9957. there are other basic rules.	18.910548845700152
9958. a turnout	may have two levers one to actually move the switch points the other	to lock the points.	8.80758588773232
9959. a signal cannot be cleared until all the related	turnouts are properly thrown and locked.	7.903336577273323
9960. such locks are nearly	always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic.	9.91757377709928
9961. the	lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that	a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point.	6.438457291400927
9962. if the points aren't	thrown all the way the turnout cannot be locked and in turn	the signal cannot be cleared.	10.605292529735307
9963. generally these locks on turnouts are	called facing point locks.	6.768356798132767
9964. figs 1-6 show typical arrangements	of track and signals.	7.1036836051263155
9965. each diagram is accompanied by a dog	chart a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular	lever will lock if pulled.	6.964833912978675
9966. the lines connecting the wedge-shaped	dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.	9.175303784221912
9967. by studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several	other details.	4.3417015116471145
9968. derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide	the wheels off the rails if a train passes a stop signal- are	used in many instances.	5.85577070230384
9969. home signals have two blades.	10.28958726932349
9970. the blacked-in	blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move.	6.589413320164942
9971. as	an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal	is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located	beyond the limits of the interlocking plant.	7.639652996805564
9972. in some low-speed situations	the distant signal is fixed at caution.	10.051440973392918
9973. in other instances where	there is no automatic block signaling the distant has only green	and yellow aspects.	7.523292565024276
9974. so much for the prototype.	15.528161428988247
9975. the interlocking	frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then	installed on paul larson's railroad follows the fig 1 scheme	and is shown beginning in fig 7 page 65 and in the photos.	6.165665933243645
9976. here's	how it can be built.	8.92944618607499
9977. the sizes of pieces needed	for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig 7 most	of the bars being 18'' brass in 14'' and 12'' widths.	4.881204240223201
9978. you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers	and locks as you wish.	10.67227939388929
9979. our instructions assume you are building	this particular frame which is for a junction.	7.179888070798207
9980. when cutting	the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or sanding	disk.	10.207897691550233
9981. start with the right-hand piece b f soldering	it to the lower piece a of the same material but 12''	long.	7.312012152761405
9982. let exactly 1'' of a extend beyond b and	use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.	7.652235357863072
9983. now	lay 12 pieces of f cut 5-34'' long side by side but separated	by 12 pieces of the same material 12'' sq.	6.575506707956603
9984. this gives you the	spacing for locating the left-hand piece b.	12.287922325274259
9985. compress the assembly	when you make the mark to show the location for b.	7.477601345597643
9986. solder	this second b to a at right angles.	9.82652027362338
9987. there	should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be	1'' from an end of the long piece.	5.577138538737023
9988. cap this assembly	with a f bar.	10.555638181539077
9989. tack-solder all the 12''	sq pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members.	2.9371090583272172
9990. these will be drilled	and tapped later on.	12.50166008836441
9991. now cut five f locking bar spacers	.	10.036515537166414
9992. position these using six intermediate temporary	f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar a.	6.714313432104116
9993. solder	it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame.	7.54475830540641
9994. now place 12 pieces	12'' sq on this edge as we did before and space them with	the 5-34'' long tappets as they are called.	7.289619572646048
9995. cap with a f	bar and tack-solder in place.	5.864436273812438
9996. cap the locking bar spacers with two	f directly under the first two b pieces.	10.414357609621995
9997. remove all the	loose spacing bars.	10.254412559661871
9998. mark and center-punch all the holes required	for screws to hold this assembly together.	7.5147253838304575
9999. placement	of these holes is not critical but they should be located so that	the centers are about 18'' from any edge.	5.3974580308841436
10000. drill all no 50 and	counter-drill all except the a pieces size 43.	9.000561803736195
10001. tap the a	pieces 2-56.	9.700058290985755
10002. now unsolder and disassemble the frame	except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-34'' bars	which are soldered together.	6.466546030927323
10003. either lay	the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters	so they may be replaced in their proper positions.	6.884894887339783
10004. dress all surfaces	with a file cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.	8.367356312277304
10005. drill 20 no 47 holes in the upper piece a as shown in	fig 7.	8.042748463331648
10006. tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later	on.	7.565065182236538
10007. note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.	5.345829806000728
10008. now reassemble the frame using f roundhead steel screws and nuts.	9.423880339479451
10009. put the 12 tappets and some f locking bar spacers in the frame to	help align all the components before you tighten the screws.	7.7190401133924
10010. be sure	the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 12'' sq spacer.	8.508451843925952
10011. as	an anchor for the spring lock insert a f bar in the lower left corner	of the frame as shown in fig 7.	8.089455317520441
10012. drill a no 43 hole through	the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw.	9.284041645227447
10013. drill two no 50	holes one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly	above it and tap 2-56.	8.143539893054054
10014. number all the tappet bars before removing them	so they can be replaced in the same slots.	11.965438185272918
10015. remove all other loose	pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth.	10.559104659308305
10016. cut five pieces	of f brass bar stock 3-34'' long.	8.91002346904333
10017. these are supporting members	for the short locking bars.	8.282250794316953
10018. locate their positions in fig 7 and	drill no 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame.	11.330600120873743
10019. cut off	excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut.	7.623536586226167
10020. drill	four no 19 and four no 28 holes in the 12'' long a	pieces.	7.762436694014751
10021. locate the position from fig 7.	8.788883504914487
10022. bars	draw-file no 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective	slot and square the ends.	7.163492755049154
10023. break the end corners with a slight 45 degree	chamfer.	7.814573324569206
10024. drill a no 50 hole 1-14'' from one end and tap	2-56.	14.314130661393166
10025. put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole cut	off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.	6.612522640961123
10026. to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame	and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge.	10.039763748388037
10027. scribe a line	across the bar on the other end of the tappet 14'' plus half the	diameter of the 2-56 screw head away from the frame	edge.	6.182219126630139
10028. total distance is about 2164''.	12.15283897171844
10029. tend to make this dimension	slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly	14'' tappet movement.	6.721397433444334
10030. drill a no 50 hole tap 2-56 and insert	a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end.	8.537375694733068
10031. drill a no	47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in	figs	7 and 8.	7.472208735816067
10032. repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet	bars.	11.497621492483956
10033. to each tappet except 6 and 8 solder a f piece of	brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs 6 and 8.	6.988292634608789
10034. these	will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.	9.611514760952513
10035. fitting	the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job	since stop screws tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced	many times.	6.972425919012492
10036. as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become	a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before	the part you are working on is accessible.	9.565900627189937
10037. a little extra work	here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you are finished.	6.921868846497069
10038. each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work	progresses to insure snug fitting.	9.45165822704882
10039. the order of fitting is not	too important.	13.252897374963602
10040. however we started with the first row of bars and worked	our way back.	11.113781201287695
10041. since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs	and notches is used throughout we will only describe the construction	of one locking bar.	6.66967553547276
10042. figs 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.	11.194705058099851
10043. all the bars are cut from f brass.	11.655165982269644
10044. the lengths of each piece are	listed at the bottom of fig 7.	13.032048898046833
10045. bar c is 2-34'' long.	6.674653657897716
10046. draw-file the edges square up the ends and put a slight chamfer	on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.	8.396166709685962
10047. fig 8 gives	the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes.	7.017277080438774
10048. center-punch and drill	the no 31 hole 716'' from one end of the bar.	7.48999905293886
10049. chuck a length	of 18'' dia drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning	device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file	a slight taper 18'' long.	5.1951646130226194
10050. cut the piece about 932'' or 516''	long and drive it into the no 31 hole drilled in the locking	bar.	8.411525191878615
10051. file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 18''	above the bar.	8.288209350133798
10052. this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.	11.249231531652864
10053. place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.	9.07753805961022
10054. scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of	tappet 3 parallel to piece a.	14.463838596800656
10055. see the drawings for the shape	of the notch.	10.300309236871183
10056. scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out	with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool.	7.564835477935443
10057. we used	the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .	8.47753027146704
10058. 020'' thick and	1'' dia fitted on a 18'' dia mandrel.	4.667272928550481
10059. such disks are	very handy for cutting and shaping small parts.	7.0381184074641325
10060. file to a smooth finish.	14.279309414048022
10061. a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular	shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without	marring an adjoining one.	5.956472910919388
10062. endeavor to get the notches as much alike	as possible.	10.761631232079216
10063. the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel	dog will slide easily over it.	8.785137325707778
10064. assemble the parts in the frame and	test the sliding action of the mating pieces.	9.501869890802356
10065. all matching surfaces	should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.	6.872636670162
10066. chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 18'' dia drill rod in a	drill press or	electric hand tool.	5.492930588852786
10067. fashion a sharp scribing point about 364''	long on one end using swiss pattern files.	5.665496787356968
10068. this tool can also be	made with a lathe.	11.669047381434329
10069. scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on	mathematics.	10.987962896191352
10070. without math the men who are continually seeking the causes	of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round	would not have any means of analyzing standardizing and communicating	the things they discover and learn.	9.19963369729894
10071. math and the formulas that	allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential	to any scientific endeavor.	7.146581495955655
10072. hot rodding is a science.	11.014405610253803
10073. it's	not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate	on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit	but it is nevertheless a science.	5.1973263882634
10074. but because science is based on mathematics	doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.	10.586747946448357
10075. a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years	without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems;	however he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and	the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few	formulas that apply to rodding.	6.244341344705362
10076. a mathematical formula is nothing	more than a pattern for solving a specific problem.	10.17522672344938
10077. it places the	various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation	to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can	be computed.	11.244087303977205
10078. the first step in using a formula is to insert the	numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions	in the formula.	12.740269701152865
10079. this changes the formula to an equation.	10.424429816122545
10080. the	equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.	11.070425670194599
10081. equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.	7.5146672982426646
10082. they involve	only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic	classes.	10.248498360529734
10083. however it is essential that the various mathematical symbols	used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes	can be done properly and in their correct order.	8.519005845260496
10084. they indicate	simple division multiplication subtraction and addition.	12.777733962025929
10085. the	symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers	placed one above the other.	6.900354553581217
10086. the lower number is always divided into the	upper number: f   the symbol for multiplication is .	8.569916582328023
10087. it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row.	20.146540071166033
10088. for example:	f numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any	order.	8.833937597581695
10089. the result will be the same regardless of the order used.	17.554817362845018
10090. the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign.	14.057099447711387
10091. this is	nothing more than a dash.	11.007080783412263
10092. it separates two or more numbers.	20.557088453207776
10093. the number	on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on	the left of the symbol.	10.439278394102647
10094. for example: f when more than two figures	are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried	out from the left to right if the result is to be correct.	8.572742905423109
10095. for example	for the problem f 10 from 25 equals 15 then 6 from 15 equals	9.	6.973541730404112
10096. addition is indicated by the + symbol.	8.64845214219982
10097. the symbol is	used to separate two or more numbers.	11.274711028535757
10098. for example: f numbers separated	by addition symbols may be placed in any order.	7.619751719118117
10099. when solving	an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all	the division steps first	to reduce those parts of the equation to their	numerical value.	7.411808001312838
10100. multiplication subtraction and addition can then	be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left	end of the equation and working toward the right.	10.5175263928362
10101. completing the	division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication	subtraction or addition steps: f this would be reduced	by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12.	5.21716416736054
10102. this part	of the equation would then become 4.	13.36843287346194
10103. for use in formulas fractions	should be converted to their decimal equivalents.	9.841519914811034
10104. the easiest	way to do this is with a conversion chart.	12.83704879677891
10105. charts for this purpose	are available from many sources.	7.2949904747434315
10106. they are included in all types of mathematical	handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision	measuring instruments.	11.236989500733024
10107. the various mathematical processes can	be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.	7.543737048293195
10108. shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental	effect on the accuracy of the final result.	11.47455746077156
10109. a constant is a number that remains the same	regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant	equation.	10.386584450723577
10110. it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved	correctly.	21.594586205903248
10111. rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.	8.885639840181192
10112. the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases	and	quite often are necessary for completing entry blanks for different	events.	9.798672584270937
10113. when it is needed one formula is as important as another.	15.199748418523345
10114. however some formulas are used more than others.	12.078685424869935
10115. we'll take	them in the general order of their popularity.	5.127535365434798
10116. a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.	11.949371322803879
10117. displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume.	8.277903991967294
10118. most	entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information	because of class restrictions.	7.908192277092596
10119. it is good to be able to compute	displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking	can be computed.	10.286762113539782
10120. factors involved in the displacement formula	are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders the length of the	piston stroke the number of cylinders in the engine and a constant.	9.925140450924847
10121. 7854 which is one-quarter of 3.	5.914218763127433
10122. 1416 another constant	known as pi.	9.51828979249826
10123. pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions	of circles.	9.247456096291875
10124. actually the engine displacement formula is	the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type	with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the	engine.	10.455843148885041
10125. the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and	then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying	the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length	of the cylinders.	8.007610259732699
10126. multiplying the result by the number of cylinders	in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.	8.480697343150224
10127. dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give	the displacement in cubic inches.	7.377164028503781
10128. dimensions in centimeters and fractions	of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters	.	10.559312922178517
10129. 54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.	5.322750487150202
10130. for example let's consider a standard	283 cubic inch chevy v8.	8.971817203234178
10131. these engines have a cylinder diameter	of 3-78 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches.	6.411268383493361
10132. the formula with	the fractions converted to decimals becomes f.	10.312429762602429
10133. to arrive	at the answer multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of	the group and working to the right.	9.064342071822349
10134. the different steps will look like	this: f	a cylinder's compression ratio	is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume or its displacement	with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.	6.855172972760118
10135. cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber	volume must be measured with a liquid.	7.230872750653363
10136. cylinder volume is	determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula:	f.	15.299699854602691
10137. to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers	in the cylinder head install the valves and spark plug in the chamber	and support the head so that its gasket surface is level.	9.146571188725902
10138. then pour	water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill	the chamber to its gasket surface.	9.22669504651572
10139. do not overfill the chamber.	12.882656516737265
10140. this	is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.	11.40487107156552
10141. such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface	around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.	7.67293285121822
10142. the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting	the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from	the original quantity.	12.799004623266208
10143. most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters	making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.	7.7077922393551095
10144. however the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic	centimeters.	15.826419014594837
10145. the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will	be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are	used.	7.735127314215895
10146. the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be	quoted in the same terms.	12.881634614691425
10147. the volume of the cylinder opening	in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square	inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch.	6.730843392325641
10148. sometimes	it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening	but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy	that it won't affect the final computation.	6.737382605553043
10149. the volume of the opening	is added to the combustion chamber volume.	13.168915743339642
10150. another thing	that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between	the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston	is in top dead center position.	15.92673766857294
10151. compute this volume by measuring	the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately	as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring	device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.	7.699306443911464
10152. the	formula for this step is: f this volume is added to the total volume	of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening.	8.908678208602618
10153. the total of	these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume.	8.7646738695098
10154. after the factors just described have been computed they are applied	to the following formula: f   for an example let's dream	up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic	inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches.	7.698311717221514
10155. applying these figures	to the formula we get the equation: f the compression ratio is	10 to 1.	5.47630599229847
10156. this method of computing compression ratio cannot be	used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly	shaped heads.	8.161550556370853
10157. any irregularity on the piston heads will make	it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion	chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot	be readily computed.	6.8899590706455305
10158. the only way to determine the final combustion	chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid	while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston	is in top dead center position.	12.310141895211107
10159. there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships	of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire	size.	9.813166279899361
10160. by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can	be determined for any combination of the other three.	13.089955447796957
10161. to simplify	the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of	the factors.	8.047832027666166
10162. these are   mph for car speed   rpm	for engine crankshaft speed   r for rear axle gear ratio	w for tire size   tire size can be determined in	several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is	by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly.	8.596820800278822
10163. this	is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire	is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft.	9.496350717559556
10164. a tire must be inflated	to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to	its operating weight when this measurement is made.	7.937211153560436
10165. the measurement	must be in inches.	12.11163630983322
10166. any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement	must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.	11.64622906844718
10167. when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used	in the formula.	7.599076770184413
10168. to determine car speed for a given combination	of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is: f	for an engine speed of 5000 rpm a gear ratio of 4.	7.856125389962811
10169. 00 to 1 and a	tire radius of 13 inches the equation would look like this: f	to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three	factors the formula is: f using the same figures as for the	previous example the equation becomes: f   to determine the	rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors the	formula is: f using the figures from the previous examples the	equation becomes: f	- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up	to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner	a member of the dick williams stable who was	clocked 2:25.	4.940300815827916
10170. she is owned by ralph h kroening milwaukee	wis who according to the railbirds can feel justly proud of her.	9.737418143057534
10171. other good miles have been by debonnie	and prompt time in 2:28-:36;	kimberly gal 2:26.	5.837936539080935
10172. 2; laguerre	hanover	and monel	in 2:34h.	6.918564493827965
10173. laguerre hanover is outstanding in type and conformation-	good body plenty of heart girth stands straight on his legs	on excellent feet- and has the smoothest gait.	4.353683074586456
10174. this colt is behind	most of the other 2-year-olds in the simpson stable but can show	about as much pace as any of them.	9.21497363780478
10175. monel shows improvement with each	work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her	share of races.	5.34422462533294
10176. stardel	2:34h looks quite promising.	7.419628574479786
10177. fury hanover	caper and isaac	have been working together but have not equalled their best	work done some weeks ago.	6.154581353771773
10178. fury and caper worked in 2:35h and did	it with ease.	7.259126108284013
10179. they are two good colts of different type.	10.624800953601314
10180. fury is	upstanding and on the rangy side and caper is more the compact type.	9.832543875410252
10181. i have never seen caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but	'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so.	6.289906247359943
10182. fury	has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect with his	impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.	8.070421782659254
10183. trackdown has worked a mile in 2:33.	9.131023545865714
10184. it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace.	15.164343197786883
10185. then after	emasculation he was eased up for a couple of weeks.	10.310150719107034

10195. the first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare;	the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff.	7.491202709710205
10196. the fourth time in	harness he walked off like a gentleman.	12.803883010119856
10197. being blistered for curbs has	delayed his work somewhat.	7.675725862937975
10198. but up to date he has shown as much as any	in the big simpson stable.	14.89126411567874

10283. well if you're	that kind of sportsman we're here to help you.	4.563069824863786
10284. you've probably	given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack	but it's not easy to decide on a new one.	5.149990774532963
10285. you still have time to	drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time	to decide on them is now.	5.628584169072989
10286. as a christmas service i've taken a close	look at this year's crop of new models.	5.873041937983577
10287. here they are with my	comments and judgments.	10.859873084562395
10288. read on take your pick- and start dropping	those hints.	8.083182887444046
10289. first on my own list would be two arms- a rifle	and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.	4.957287172345382
10290. for me a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute	a truly new design.	7.8176427712963505
10291. such modifications are all for the best but	it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change	arms-making concepts.	6.23139061640957
10292. bill ruger's long-awaited deerstalker	is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the	modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short light quick-handling	fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug	at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for	our most popular big game- whitetail.	4.9831635479659155
10293. ruger reports that	on his recent african safari the little .	6.430379548619343
10294. 44 magnum cartridge was a	real work horse.	9.993966711174354
10295. small antelope were generally grassed with one shot	and the .	6.55138858741498
10296. 44 magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck kob and wart hog with	deadly efficiency; these are fairly large tough animals.	6.071724164794767
10297. the deadliness of the .	10.212984122316984
10298. 44 magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to	me.	9.713702156010635
10299. at least five years ago tom robinson of marlin made up an overunder	double rifle for me in this caliber using the now defunct model	90 action in 20-gauge size.	7.703374472190227
10300. after figuring out how to regulate the	barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this	little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin's underground	test gallery.	7.861243903317642
10301. we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill	ruger in his first experiments: three or four bullets would be	placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then unaccountably	one could stray far out of the group.	5.796091940983541
10302. ruger learned that this	was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting	the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.	8.896804465860134
10303. the new jacketed slug	in .	10.830131941161474
10304. but even without jacketed bullets i	had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt	that first year.	8.862411377008616
10305. within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that	hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket and i caught him just behind	the left foreleg at 60 yards.	5.076545195062105
10306. he moved only about 30 feet after	the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed	through a sapling.	7.212447028096598
10307. three more deer have fallen to this same	gun and all were one-shot kills.	6.477472011579827
10308. my double was made with standard-weight	revolver barrels and although	it compares well in other respects it's considerably heavier than	the deerstalker which only scales about 6-12 pounds.	5.236667306079631
10309. if ever	a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter this is it.	10.217849565934243
10310. the deerstalker	points with the ease speed and precision of a fine imported	double shotgun and its trigger pull is light and sharp.	8.792888663292878
10311. the 240-grain	bullet leaves the muzzle at 1850 fps which gives it all the smash	needed at woods ranges.	5.9725539649373305
10312. with five shots at the immediate command	of the hunter's trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination.	7.792003591948178
10313. the second really new development this year was a revolver	handling a different sort of varmint load- the .	6.582890037209289
10314. 22 remington jet	magnum center fire.	11.461541924602058
10315. at present it's available in one model the	fine and familiar smith + wesson magnum revolver	long a top-quality handgun among target arms.	3.681605102259394
10316. the velocity of this .	16.653734394480644
10317. 22-caliber	40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2460 fps and it's	the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge with a mid-range	rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range.	3.946560126476497
10318. this is a varmint load	pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game.	7.548151805038309
10319. it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry	of feathers.	8.62330287268557
10320. the most intriguing aspect of the s+w magnum	chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard .	11.789629670811358
10321. 22 rim-fires	by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.	5.811045531095714
10322. you may therefore	convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm although the difference	in the point of impact can be somewhat disconcerting.	9.345562914137421
10323. the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine; i tested	it in my scoped s+w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a	chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun	steadily.	6.159293211850529
10324. the fact that the deerstalker	and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't	mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models actions and calibers.	8.538407970805668
10325. aside from the ruger carbine a number of hunting rifles have been	introduced for the first time.	8.730948362936902
10326. here are the brands	and the new models.	14.196382001021153
10327. newcomers to the american hunter	are the browning group of bolt-action high-power rifles.	5.763368605174054
10328. they have	fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal	and the stock wood.	7.89457784388763
10329. barrel weights vary sensibly with the various	calibers available and these include the standard bores	plus the magnums; the latter include the .	5.0423046287252244
10330. shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard	on all of the magnums except the .	8.900972416486598
10331. stock designs are excellent	for use with scopes.	7.69995246632496
10332. colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are	all made with sako actions regardless of caliber.	6.311231553814967
10333. 222's have	the short action; the .	4.119261979553155
10334. 308 the medium action and the .	10.264332627349011
10335. 270	f and the magnums the long action	.	9.947312847834366
10336. previously fn actions	were used for the larger cartridges.	11.534999953081998
10337. high standard has	introduced a .	9.750425410881501
10338. 22 auto the sport-king in two grades- field and special	.	6.065327624529291
10339. it's a streamlined	rifle fast and well-made.	1.7388344459638478
10340. 22 magnum rim-fire	rifles 1961's lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader	.	6.548232130264144
10341. previously known as jefferson arms kodiak has given	this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design and the	260 is the first autoloader to handle .	5.245897691741994
10342. marlin	has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings.	10.563009745356286
10343. the	model 99 is a light-weight streamlined .	5.460971134047338
10344. 22 rim-fire auto	with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles.	7.980362152192257
10345. it's extremely	accurate for an auto and the test rifle i tried was completely	trouble-free in functioning.	3.0100793382837003
10346. the 989 is an even newer .	12.708680913940446
10347. 22	auto this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.	5.330746157468505
10348. once again the	mossberg targo outfit has appeared but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun	combination.	10.360213089901054
10349. the bore is unrifled but is provided with an	insert tube which is rifled and which surprisingly gives pretty fair	accuracy even though it's only 3-12 inches long.	4.735366937636654
10350. you can unscrew	this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .	14.199795923181247
10351. 22 shotshells-	to break the little targo clay targets.	5.838287428963363
10352. a trap for throwing	these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can	throw his own targets.	8.611504162124028
10353. a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular	hand trap are also available.	7.08632094722926
10354. you can have your choice of a seven-shot	repeater the 340tr or a single-shot the 320tr	.	9.26052677272382
10355. the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting	or for economic wing-shooting practice but it's tougher than it looks	to run up a score on the clay birds.	4.774916036406965
10356. they'll travel 50 feet or	more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to	break one after it passes the 35-foot mark.	4.551965944353296
10357. the combination of thin	pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds	right now!   big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line	for 1961 with the addition of the .	7.561427173713448
10358. 375 and .	11.91717834882239
10359. 458 to the list of model	725's.	12.216800810684386
10360. these are made on special order only in kodiak grade	with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads;	they weigh around nine pounds.	7.017400109571866
10361. a shortened version of the	highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961.	6.536019660010842
10362. this	carbine has an 18-12-inch	barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's	model 760 pump with a short-barrel.	7.340445697265938
10363. this design is hard to beat	for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.	7.888683787415972
10364. presently	the 742c is available in f.	10.495015844209838
10365. the latest versions of the famous	savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight and the	99 deluxe which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger	design.	5.648548013282848
10366. the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will	make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new	safety is easier and faster to operate.	7.206752799910934
10367. a fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 and they're	good bets for your christmas gift list if you're wondering what to	get for a youngster.	4.058489943407162
10368. the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49	- a lever-action single-shot patterned	after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western	look.	5.979218346295387
10369. because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid	appeal than any other model.	10.014679969475514
10370. the action is a drop-block handling all	the standard .	9.651345928077207
10371. marlin's latest is also designed	for the beginning shooter although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty	of barrel weight and ample stock.	3.3040282271924237
10372. this is the model 122	; it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety-	ie the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun	cocked for the next shot.	6.278440244245191
10373. stock design is excellent and this model	is a good first gun.	7.186505884846635
10374. another boy's model is the .	7.886296558609526
10375. 22 single-shot remington	514c which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a	short- 12-12-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-12.	3.314282250638887
10376. a beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.	8.189314251631231
10377. the single-barrel stevens 940y is made with a side lever	rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong	enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does	indeed open very easily.	4.760801800607861
10378. this gun has a 12-12-inch stock and is	available in either 20 or .	7.915502664180185
10379. there's another addition to	the stevens line the pump-action model 77 in .	3.102060636399438
10380. 410 which	you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters	like this gauge and type of scattergun too.	6.769777790032252
10381. although	there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year	a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit	the market.	6.67286546331204
10382. for example a browning trap version of the superposed	overunder the broadway differs	from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore	end a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast	sighting.	9.030039992709893
10383. the colt line now includes a new scattergun the standard	or custom pump model in	12 16 and 20.	6.166587095889024
10384. firearms international has introduced another	import this one from finland.	9.974883964289559
10385. it's the valmet a 12-gauge	overunder very much like the old remington 32- which was	so fine	a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.	2.9543170608612686
10386. high	standard has also added two models to its line.	9.38160769886954
10387. the supermatic trophy	is a 12-gauge auto.	7.645039813333596
10388. the flite-king trophy	is a pump gun in 12 or 16.	8.565249029407811
10389. either model is a very good	dollar value.	9.05628655117164
10390. mossberg's latest contribution to the field is	the model 500; this is an improved version of the old	model 200 a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.	6.76575125630042
10391. see page 24 for a complete	report on it.	8.257705568298435
10392. 22 jet- which	i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two	biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among	1961's handguns.	5.650562215591572
10393. livery stable- j vernon prop coaching had declined	considerably by 1905 but the sign was still there near the old	wells fargo building in san francisco creaking in the fog as it	had for thirty years.	4.962074441743556
10394. john vernon had had all the patronage he cared	for- he had prospered but he could not retire from horsedom.	8.09941077962338
10395. coaching	was in his blood.	8.421333050084284
10396. he had two interests in life: the pleasures	of the table and driving.	11.218509898758715
10397. twice a week he drove his tallyho over the	santa cruz road upland and through the redwood forest with orchards	below him at one hand and glimpses of the pacific at the other.	6.671780039500147

10912. the 80-hp motor drives	her at 25 mph with six aboard!   with only two aboard hotei	does better than 27	mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this	speed even in a three-foot chop.	5.871242590674345
10913. she also banks into a turn like	a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all	over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser.	6.338940820059555
10914. nor is she a wet boat.	14.043099821587818
10915. we've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.	3.4052304030519416

10921. the well itself is designed to take two	merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon	long-cruise gas tank below it.	4.908582996635884
10922. needless to say you can't	build hotei in a couple of weeks.	8.501252843629276
10923. our building time was slightly	over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom	sink head and hardware was under $800.	6.303191699320343
10924. a comparable manufactured	boat would cost close to $3000.	11.298430547667497
10925. consider what you have to earn to be	able to spend the $3000 and your building time is well worth it.	8.787510511470398
10926. a	gator trailer model 565 is used to transport the boat to the waterways.	9.252635060633194
10927. this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save	you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.	6.974250190302712
10928. all framing	in hotei is one-inch mahogany which in the dressed state you	buy it is about the 1316-inch thickness specified in the drawings.	7.348616280321776
10929. therefore	the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens	etc on a table saw.	6.243459868805426
10930. besides flathead bronze screws silicon bronze	stronghold nails	are used extensively in assembly and weldwood	resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.	8.723298216878154
10931. follows a thorough study of the drawings.	10.229766805533108
10932. start by laying out the six	frames and the transom on a level floor.	12.038612724561954
10933. draw each outline in a different-color	chalk one on top of the other.	7.921757755695675
10934. in this way you will be	able to detect any obvious mistakes.	16.137995172070493
10935. the transom frame is made	first with the joints lapped glued and fastened with one-inch no	12 stronghold nails.	5.79040229408806
10936. after notching it for the keelson chines and	battens the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue	and the same type	nails.	8.358119081271782
10937. all frames are butted at the joints and 38-inch plywood gussets	are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the one-inch	no 12 nails.	6.142495273752837
10938. the frames are notched only for the keelson	and the chines.	12.692408055352207
10939. if notched for the battens they would require more work	be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge	water could flow through.	7.994039910142355
10940. nowhere in the boat do the frames come in	contact with the plywood planking.	9.662670282328643
10941. the jig is erected after the	frames and transom are complete.	7.49396414211318
10942. this is an important step because	any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull	as you advance in construction.	10.08886549009336
10943. be sure all members are parallel	vertical and level as required.	10.662861464084994
10944. after the frames and transom	are set up on the jig and temporarily braced a piece of three-inch-wide	mahogany	is butted between frames one and two below the line	of the keelson.	10.093028448250458
10945. the frames are glued and screwed to this piece.	14.708499772147393
10946. the	joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated	fiberglas cloth and nailed.	7.737967269281737
10947. it is over this piece that the	laminated stem and keelson are spliced.	11.094295841714604
10948. the keelson made of	two three-inch widths is next installed.	8.51990541858845
10949. the first piece is glued	and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames	one and two.	9.606522719209844
10950. the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the	first.	16.98955914184904
10951. note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.	9.197550662010729
10952. one-inch no 10 screws are used in both cases.	8.380199725529394
10953. a stem	jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to	frame one.	7.034044816084957
10954. the stem is laminated from four pieces.	11.691582561780148
10955. take two three-inch-wide	pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make	the four.	7.8501092386572715
10956. then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and	bend them into place on the jig.	10.144405167934014
10957. the first two pieces butt against	the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace	between the first two frames.	11.264195508715117
10958. the second two pieces lap over the inner	member of the keelson and butt against the outer member.	11.433750249582177
10959. they're	glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson.	8.835413288083837
10960. a number of c	clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.	12.894916563643228
10961. all bottom battens are two inches wide.	9.400463182999147
10962. the side ones are a half-inch	narrower.	14.003782074529433
10963. the battens are carefully fastened in place after some	necessary fairing on all frames.	7.325338286036964
10964. glue and 1-12-inch no 10 screws	are used.	6.9876505049694355
10965. placement is important because the rear seat bunks and	front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.	7.438165386316214
10966. with the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they	are glued and screwed after careful beveling.	13.493274555836095
10967. the chines go in the same	way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength	and easier bending.	7.638765906960146
10968. fairing is always a tedious job but	the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple	jig.	9.196353352685643
10969. i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer	with a pair of sure grips.	6.950058550380086
10970. the aluminum flush against the battens	acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson	to the proper bevels easily.	7.937493624798932
10971. if you don't own a planer and don't	want to buy one it's well worth renting.	3.915839545289494
10972. is five-ply 38-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood.	7.6215160156846125
10973. this	can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long.	6.682115788978158
10974. the 42-inch width	leaves very little waste.	8.625474293913868
10975. plank the sides first	using glue and one-inch no 12 stronghold nails at all battens	the stem and the transom.	5.150949684891582
10976. another person inside with a weight against	each batten will help in the fastening.	9.551955111216703
10977. the best procedure is to	have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.	7.344186597616781
10978. i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter	cable for this job.	9.470050559673345
10979. it's good for cutting all the planking because	it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter	the plywood like a saber saw.	3.5197306130233352
10980. when cut the planking is clamped	in place for a final and careful trimming.	11.743262370997073
10981. then it is marked on the	inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and	all the battens.	9.542480391906981
10982. it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings.	13.802589130553846
10983. the	next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at	the contact points.	9.055174585111974
10984. then it is replaced and fastened.	20.393647310638297
10985. the bottom planking	is applied in the same manner.	9.78938273953409
10986. after planking the bottom	gets a layer of fiberglas.	12.437844894675441
10987. the spray rails are first glued on the	outside and fastened from the inside with screws.	8.005408245628821
10988. then the chines are	rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.	10.065833101264946
10989. since the	sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also rough-sanded	in that area.	7.0697566326135375
10990. the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at	a time.	17.02104676170103
10991. a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line	by about three inches.	6.693513088264179
10992. lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.	10.974962132589718
10993. then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin.	8.700840178602922
10994. when the resin	has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.	9.843255784158472
10995. i used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding	the hardener.	7.897420248410432
10996. using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with	the resin and then apply the cloth.	13.35236093594156
10997. when the cloth is smooth apply	another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller.	10.094273498444412
10998. be sure it is	well saturated and then allow it to harden.	14.519091148945884
10999. when the whole bottom	has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth	at the keel line and near the spray rail.	7.534893399852794
11000. then lay a three-inch-wide	strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of	the stem.	9.513248514639495
11001. before the resin has hardened screw a one-inch mahogany keel	strip along the centerline.	6.046723754815886
11002. this protects the bottom in beaching.	14.489892033981405
11003. fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co	1605 w elizabeth ave linden n j.	5.6449193740417005

11005. is now turned	over and placed in a level well-braced	position.	10.827660855035425
11006. i set it on the gator trailer.	16.13478640469766
11007. i laid three layers	of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye	at this time.	7.011018192738496
11008. for added strength i also fastened a small block on	each side of every frame and batten joint.	9.694240270738693
11009. again these blocks were	set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.	5.651226618511096
11010. after trimming	off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them	to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed.	12.196543198167202
11011. this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.	13.512586407000104
11012. these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry.	10.875142891521545
11013. when they're	on the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.	6.758906309711277
11014. the	sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from	frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace.	10.57731197912357
11015. note	another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between	these pieces.	8.084174660280391

11040. but each step has been broken down into easy stages utilizing	standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the	handyman.	9.990545218382723
11041. the idea behind our design is modular units	or panelization.	8.917834722113303
11042. everything possible has been scaled to standard	sizes and measurements of materials.	9.090707628454915
11043. wall panels and structural timbers	are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting.	6.51058492097376
11044. we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so	that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop	panel by panel according to plan.	12.686205761149909
11045. thus when you have prepared your	foundation and laid the floor these can be trucked to the site and erected	with a small crew of friends in a weekend.	7.599975063490638
11046. the roof timbers are	precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed	in a matter of three or four days.	11.773699994665666
11047. then you can do the finishing	touches at your leisure.	11.98717132820796
11048. due to the fact that building	codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first	thing to do is to find out what if any they are.	13.094934817236316
11049. close to a large	city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote	section there might be no restrictions at all.	7.431048750411746
11050. this can usually	be found out at the nearest town hall.	13.385718269749178
11051. at the same time check the electrical	plumbing and sanitary requirements as well as possible zoning	regulations.	11.64126583719194
11052. whether electricity and public water and sewers are available	or not check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p	gas.	9.93248913101182
11053. be sure that this information	is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion.	10.0228071611891
11054. if there	are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed	form.	13.123759464339757
11055. where a building permit is required find out what you must	present when applying for one.	8.710025128186073
11056. in many cases you must file a complete	set of plans with the local building inspector.	11.846831778444049
11057. these will be available	at cost from our plans department.	9.48091072143636
11058. some general	things to look for in a site if you haven't already bought one are	accessibility water drainage and orientation.	7.9173475289988735
11059. how are the roads	and how will they stand up?	8.300910687029482
11060.  is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;	swampy areas or intermittent springs?	8.119384368728461
11061.  a visit in the early	spring after a thaw will be very informative.	8.666404831240726
11062. note where the sun rises	and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms	come from.	8.67150908826235
11063. will the view be something you can live with?	10.831644374455907
11064.  don't	worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative	foundations later on.	6.187875592814717
11065. with this first issue	we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic	and the expandable.	9.177250887163808
11066. this will be for the	shell of the house only and does not include	the carport or balcony.	14.052032847909656
11067. this will permit you to get a rough	estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost.	9.954424047129539
11068. bear in mind	that this does not include interior panels for partitions fancy	flooring appliances and fixtures electrical wiring and plumbing	all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.	8.906345743638619
11069. the	wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard f and f of	a good grade free from structural faults.	5.988106729285891
11070. they should be as straight	as possible as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when	the walls are erected.	11.504891279685799
11071. the outside surface of the solid units shall	be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood plastic coated	panel board high density particle board asbestos-cement board or	any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building	supply dealer.	5.393636490115142
11072. the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof and	the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired.	14.882182873020033
11073. all panel	board comes in standard f foot size.	8.66667726830589
11074. it is recommended that panels	be both glued as well as nailed to the frame.	15.960201158990143
11075. the fixed window panels	with louvers should have a good grade of 18-inch double-strength glass	set in a mastic glazing compound.	5.493794451538147
11076. the louvers are constructed as	shown in the detail with a drop door for ventilation.	9.689705919362503
11077. there are standard	sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels	requiring them.	8.917631352057672
11078. the door panels are designed to accommodate standard	doors which should be of exterior grade.	12.237996103042468
11079. the filler panels for the gable	ends are cut from full f sheets as shown leaving no wastage.	6.863656520590308
11080. the	battens covering the joints are of f stock and are applied after	the walls are erected.	8.64230296902365
11081. all nails should be rustproof and aluminum is	highly recommended.	7.39408784347839
11082. note: if 12-inch panel board is used inside	and out or 58-inch one side and 38-inch the other and 18-inch glass	is used stock lumber in f f and f can be used in making the	glass panels.	5.581851453721555
11083. other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special	size lumber for the glass trim.	6.207911370937444
11084. in any case there is no special milling	or rabbeting required for the panels.	14.601221467349507
11085. with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting	tools fixtures and attachments available the drill press has become	a basic home workshop tool.	6.4372659716068705
11086. the drill press consists of a vertical	shaft which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a	drill chuck a tubular housing in which the spindle is mounted	a head in which the quill is mounted a feed lever which moves the	quill up or down a power source and a movable table upon which the work	is placed.	9.017848234527078
11087. there is often a means of locking the quill and on larger	presses the table can be tilted.	11.698653884820246
11088. the size of the press is	usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity	or distance between the spindle center and the	column.	13.601554022532932
11089. a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center	of a 22 inch board or circle.	7.149968762996499
11090. a new radial drill press with	a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done	at any angle.	8.502556042629841
11091. the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on	the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work.	8.026320903648967
11092. the drill press should be leveled and depending	on whether it is a bench or floor model bolted securely to a	sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.	10.026969457252404
11093. this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.	10.04792499399582
11094. a coat	of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the	polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth	will discourage rusting of the column and quill.	7.195751659888221
11095. presses not fitted	with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in	the lubrication holes in the quill.	7.095169630375162
11096. the rest of the press should be kept	clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.	12.20352406494113
11097. be careful to	keep the drive belt free of oil and grease.	9.072370677027983
11098. belt tension is adjusted	by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount.	8.249089359568496
11099. keep	the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by	hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle	bearings.	4.543817722614439
11100. most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises	the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds	the quill in the raised position.	8.58043825248282
11101. the return spring tension may be	adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing	with a pair of pliers	loosening the lock nut or screw and rotating the housing	until the desired tension is achieved.	6.138572807343488
11102. turning the housing clockwise	will reduce tension counter-clockwise will increase it.	7.776542454070092
11103. lose the chuck key	some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide	a socket for the chuck key; otherwise you'll have to spend	a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the	press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the	bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not	in use.	5.771357103639164
11104. drill speeds are important if you want	a good job.	11.3941113749615
11105. each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed	depending on the material worked.	7.15799579043953
11106. on most drill presses it is impossible	to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the	drive belt on the step-cone pulleys.	9.734828870756289
11107. you will find a chart giving the	various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere	in the instruction booklet that came with the tool.	7.383174313949232
11108. see the table	on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.	11.22744574714331
11109. generally the larger the	tool and the harder the material the slower the speed.	7.915435271745271
11110. feed pressure	is also of major importance.	11.021644229796495
11111. too much pressure will force the	tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed	or broken tools.	6.941924144532618
11112. too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard	material causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting	edge.	10.023443081384826
11113. the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed	with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even	rate.	6.943868712419005
11114. there are numerous types and styles	of tools to drill holes.	14.663223110945346
11115. the most common are the twist drill the	solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades the double spur	bit and the power wood bit.	6.549623517023525
11116. all will do a good job if sharp but the	twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others since they	do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual	boring starts.	7.7397813874845784
11117. the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting	large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by	reversing the cutter blade.	6.362397256832637
11118. since fly cutters are one sided and not	balanced they should be used at the slowest speed available and fed	very slowly to avoid binding.	9.65067454517513
11119. fly cutters can fool you into putting	your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid nicked fingers	keep your hands well out of the way.	7.543632082415184
11120. when drilling all the way through a workpiece always place a	piece of scrap wood underneath.	11.370848313316735
11121. this will not only protect the work	table but also assure a clean breakthrough.	8.81035136775017
11122. another method of assuring	a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through	then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over	and finish from the other side.	9.079163489566984
11123. in soft woods with pronounced grain	there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander due to the varying	hardness of the wood.	7.3755840510204695
11124. in this case drilling a small pilot hole or	clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.	12.135461885677696
11125. when a hole	is to be bored to a predetermined depth mark the depth on the side	of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark.	9.75486342634482
11126. the depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to	exact and identical depth.	9.789687617267768
11127. the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts	are of unusual interest in many respects.	6.2359586185777784
11128. for their length their	types of construction their picturesque settings and their literary	associations they should be known and remembered.	9.4928356839611
11129. in this sequence	i shall write about them in the order of their erection.	14.194827067955318
11130. the	first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part- and perhaps	the most interesting one connected newbury with	salisbury point.	8.047781778168204
11131. its building was first proposed in 1791 when a	group of citizens mostly newburyport men petitioned the general court	no	1 newbury port may 30th 1791 a bridge over	merrimack river from the land of hon'ble jonathan greenleaf	esquire in newbery to deer island and from said island to salisbury	would be of very extensive utility by affording a safe conveyance	to carriages teams	and travellers at all seasons of the year	and at all times of tide.	5.229430395388057
11132. we the subscribers do agree	that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to	this or a similar writing we will present a petition to the hon'ble	general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts praying	for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such	writing with liberty to build such a bridge and a right to demand	a toll equal to that received at malden bridge and on like terms	and if such an act shall be obtained then we severally agree each	with the others that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares	set against our respective names the whole into two hundred shares	being divided and that we will pay such sums of money at such times	and in such manners as by the said proposed corporation shall	be directed and required.	7.791552031143864
11133. this paper was signed by forty-five	persons subscribing a total of two hundred shares.	7.0692210911924045
11134. a month	later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that	the bridge was to be built.	10.173854382918426
11135. the matter was considered and reconsidered	and finally opposed but in spite of many objections the court	granted a charter on january 9 1792.	7.122935728053288
11136. on november 26 of that year the	bridge was completed and opened.	12.888411508880443
11137. timothy palmer who invented	and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges	was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex	or deer island bridge although the actual work was carried	out under the direction of william coombs who received  300 as	recompense.	6.0479760015582
11138. this two-part bridge is best described by rev timothy	dwight president of yale college in his travels in new-england	and new-york published in new haven in 1821.	6.929896917283862
11139. he says	of it:   it consists of two divisions separated by an island	at a small distance from the southern shore.	6.484093874871417
11140. the division between	the island and this shore consists principally of an arch; whose	chord is one hundred and sixty feet and whose vortex is forty feet	above the high-water mark.	7.3936105863487835
11141. in appearance and	construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge.	9.021993832996927
11142. the whole length of	essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.	9.960672236518286
11143. i have already mentioned that mr timothy palmer of newburyport	was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country.	8.99635235659236
11144. as mr	palmer was educated to house-building only and had never seen a	structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit	for the invention.	6.926837845223069
11145. it is hardly necessary to remind students	of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby	rowley; that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was	sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect	moody spofford.	6.215708724206565
11146. it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man	who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the	principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth	haverhill and philadelphia.	10.073028627341218
11147. the essex merrimack bridge	when first built was not covered.	8.017896554970152
11148. as far as we know no american	bridge had been thus protected in 1792.	15.235990472843161
11149. richard s allen is the	authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed	by 1810.	6.829269573124868
11150. its original appearance is shown in an engraving published	in the massachusetts magazine in may 1793 which is reproduced	herewith.	9.449655455943542
11151. a brief description accompanying the picture	says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber.	7.098881174869755
11152. between	the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island	there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north	shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of	113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.	7.4692926913677855
11153. a	dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place	july 4 1793 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.	6.770877702906565
11154. it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter who was one of the	first share-holders stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the	occasion.	16.078387483258286
11155. the essex journal says that he delivered an oration	on the bridge which for elegance of style propriety of speech	or force of argument was truly ciceronian.	6.903145362018988
11156. the reporter must have	written this with tongue in cheek because dexter's oration could	hardly be understood; and although he later explained that he was	talking french it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to	the joys of the evening.	7.936839040973225
11157. the north portion of the essex bridge	was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice	what was estimated in the beginning.	8.296498812145273
11158. it stood in its original form	until 1882.	14.690671311706694
11159. the southern half however on account of its underbracing	was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation.	8.682139739536685
11160. in 1810 it	was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.	11.298700654942625
11161. this was built	by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette	county pennsylvania.	6.826247707528333
11162. timothy palmer had general supervision	of the work.	11.968378813550762
11163. an advertisement in the newburyport herald	december 21 1810 shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain	bridges.	6.496889634683121
11164. it reads:    information	is hereby given that mr timothy palmer of newburyport mass	has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the	chain bridge in the states of massachusetts new hampshire vermont	rhode island and connecticut so far as relates to the sale	of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges.	8.861809260071144
11165. mr	palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if	desired will view the proposed site and lay out and superintend the	work or recommend a suitable person to execute it.	5.65466460919389
11166. john	templeman	approved timothy palmer   this chain bridge proved	less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end.	8.417473261688773
11167. it fell	february 6 1827 carrying with it a horse and wagon two men and four	oxen.	9.46125880861461
11168. the horse and men were saved but the oxen drowned.	12.403608862163317
11169. in spite	of this catastrophe the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened	again on july 17 1827.	8.057357162293178
11170. this second chain bridge was 570 feet long	had two thirty-foot towers and a draw and a double roadway.	7.571192621486314
11171. the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 when the county	commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways.	7.048808567747806
11172. sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous	use the old covered wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river	at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance	of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site may	28th to june 3rd.	8.44560792587682
11173. colonel frederick w lander impersonated	will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott's	hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel	benjamin f kelley's virginia infantry then swarming	through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates.	4.3744525956680596
11174. he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops- thus the	old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure	secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.	9.431130734604572
11175. the	bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements war fire	and floods as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than	a hundred years.	6.391964283322843
11176. twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction	by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.	9.315656602256372
11177. it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the	last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic	on us route 250- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike.	6.754322171654187
11178. it is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of	its type to serve a main artery of the us highway system thus	it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.	14.749832181657045
11179. this	covered wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action	in the early morning of june 3 1861 and with subsequent troop movements	of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part	and parcel of the war story.	6.576923726747012
11180. so frequently has pictures of the bridge	appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the	old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known	structures in west virginia.	8.054377263101266
11181. completed and opened for traffic	in 1852 the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth	and his brother eli of beverly.	6.625603089569415
11182. the chenoweth brothers were experienced	bridge builders and against the competition of other and better	known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of	the covered wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike	a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties.	8.144812073675634
11183. the philippi bridge however was the chenoweth master piece	with its 139-foot dual lane span- and it stands today as a monument	to its builders.	4.816844796096808
11184. never rebuilt the bridge was strengtened in 1938	by two extra piers a concrete floor and a walk-way along the upper	side in order to care for modern traffic.	7.716607445570245
11185. during the war it	was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the	railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior.	7.2337761446162165
11186. union	soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the	rain or other inclement weather and some of them left momentoes of their	stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.	8.378498726494946
11187. but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened	when brigadier general william e jones reached philippi	while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may 1863.	6.133230637910327
11188. general	jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings including the	long bridge at fairmont and after seeing a great drove of horses	and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men	to work piling combustibles in and around it.	8.241503932700974
11189. reverend joshual corder	a baptist minister gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies	to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he	reasoned and argued pointing out that jones or other confederate	commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat.	5.380145388359385
11190. jones	relented he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of	livestock was driven up the valley via beverly and across the mountains	to feed and serve the confederate army while jones and his raiders	turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden.	7.881112093750075
11191. again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned	to destroy it after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but	for what reason is not recorded nor remembered certainly not because	of pressure from an opposing confederate force.	5.005997273110202
11192. on the second occasion	it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their	purpose.	12.908149098808034
11193. centering around this historic old structure a group	of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned	a week-long series of events beginning on may 28th and continuing	through june 3rd to observe most appropriately the centennial of	the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi.	5.071085467441831
11194. it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming	pool- eight enlightening vigorous rigorous not wholly unrewarding	years.	10.66649877577609
11195. we have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here a	bit about plumbing and pump-priming there.	6.476795783258002
11196. we have had sound grounding	in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.	11.087066468733411
11197. we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard	birds.	9.54342720190042
11198. true our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of	our neighbors have built their own pools thereby diluting our spectacular	attractions.	8.55662505630191
11199. but problems cling to pools as any pool owner knows.	8.686407604349782
11200. so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials	errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the	first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.	7.059894337001546
11201. position may not be everything but in the	case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties social andor	physical.	7.687534931867686
11202. we speak from varying viewpoints.	14.823635337782848
11203. one of us has a pool set	in a wooded area very near the house.	11.498852292492336
11204. the other has his pool far away	from the house in a field high on a hill.	12.666694577648569
11205. if you are dreaming	of a blue shimmering pool right outside your living room windows	close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of	children damp towels squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated	plastic toys.	6.735788242830129
11206. you are likely to be nearer the truth.	22.86744840002782
11207. you can	also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living	quarters the greater the chance for violation of family privacy annoying	noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude.	7.539499470099685
11208. on the	other hand out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children	cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the	pool.	8.973135498435195
11209. another dilemma: as picturesque as a sylvan pond in	the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being	of a pool.	4.657491061943809
11210. yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating	lawn every time the grass is mowed.	10.247176909225761
11211. as in choosing a wife it	is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be	in bad weather as well as in good.	8.917588629717672
11212. in the colder climes for instance	you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when	your pool will hardly look its best.	10.052684230961363
11213. it may be a big hole in the ground	filled with salt hay or an ice floe studded with logs.	9.705639879405513
11214. even a	neat plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.	9.325663444783128
11215. however recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk-	flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the	probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.	4.911550360350286
11216. naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and	size of your land.	11.411822241309746
11217. but if space and money are no problem and small children	are not on hand every day it is certainly more restful to have	your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs	of the house.	7.626675920808114
11218. and a good several feet around the pool should be neither	greensward nor woods but good hard pavement.	10.237548748968754
11219. the placement	of your pool however will not of itself solve the two major problems	of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining	to safety.	5.810947226627206
11220. coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself	as well as of your family neighbors friends and anyone you ever	talked to on a transoceanic jet.	7.234991428742119
11221. eight years ago while we were	going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period we were	each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings	to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid	out nearby for the lord and master's delectation.	5.241726510730063
11222. but not even our	first pool-side	gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.	9.127075971610656
11223. we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own	backyards.	9.264482193405822
11224. our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.	16.497694586175392
11225. had we taken a lien on a state park?	8.780388748394092
11226.  not at all.	18.661861384172425
11227. we had merely been	discovered by the pool sharks.	9.988386609598376
11228. we were in business!   from	proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step-	no more than the change from city clothes to trunks.	6.6800337890936206
11229. nai^ve of us	maybe but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over	next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling.	5.3661947060131965
11230. after the first few weeks it was	obvious that rules had to be made laid down and obeyed- even if our	popularity ratings became subnormal as a result.	9.765519296150382
11231. so rules we made	in unabashed collusion.	8.722357213398215
11232. since our viewpoints in this respect coincided	precisely we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single	social code for pool owners.	9.112308631492366
11233. first and foremost: no one-	no not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations	to his or her own circle.	5.407471480854605
11234. just short of forty lashes we finally managed	to coerce our children to this view.	10.352023812101857
11235. their friends and ours are	welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times.	7.596729529064301
11236. no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning	beforehand.	10.20845385525708
11237. no ringers either- even if they are trailing	legitimate invitees.	7.299230548718038
11238. we want to know when the potlatches telephone	exactly how many they are planning to bring so that we won't	end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august.	9.897354943023382
11239. no young children may come without adults except for a specific	organized chaperoned party.	7.367621771360785
11240. and accompanying adults are urged to	keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities.	9.658417829832993
11241. a gaggle	of gabbling mothers backs to the pool is no safeguard.	8.4448818734079
11242. no bottle	pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come	to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk	and run.	7.566825255124856
11243. a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood	we designated one day a week as the time	when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours.	5.60257713414207
11244. this has	saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less	brutal to the young less fortunate than ours.	9.514288427341
11245. we also	worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours	early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco	lunch en famille.	6.176485268232602
11246. we gently usher them to an island of tables	and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where	they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.	10.371736925481745
11247. all	dressing must be done in our small bath	house or at the swimmers' homes.	7.418408887269106
11248. a dripping parade through your house it is a good idea to have a telephone	extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between	we do however provide a limited	number of extra suits mainly for children and we stock extra towels	and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences.	9.049249371979279
11249. life-preservers the buckle-on	kapok-filled kind are held in readiness too for the very young.	4.9930488945649865
11250. safety rules of course are more	important than all the others put together.	9.999584005858374
11251. in many localities	now the law requires all pools to be fenced usually to a minimum	height of 5 feet.	7.24693361190774
11252. but fenced or unfenced no pool-side is the place	for running or horseplay.	7.800082395686388
11253. we allow no underwater endurance contests	either or inexpert versions of water polo.	7.193954340311492
11254. diving boards must	have non-skid surfaces	.	8.355066122739792
11255. and	divers must be enjoined to look before they leap either on top of	someone else or onto a pool edge.	6.133641649916935
11256. our pools also have wide shallow	steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus	be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.	8.98363842972545
11257. all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool	and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.	8.081366419144823
11258. when you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend- for your	own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent.	7.514007879785855
11259. you	should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty	pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.	7.354448061288617
11260. soignee pools alas do not just happen.	9.580645468859808
11261. they are the	result of a constant and careful contest with the elements.	8.6951141313511
11262. unless	you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your	leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity its care and	feeding- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left	to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.	6.029858211296583
11263. of course if your	pool is close to the house your wife can always add it to her housekeeping	chores.	9.845119637992866
11264. or you can make pool care the price of swimming	for teen-agers.	13.329328679854692
11265. even so every pool owner in case of emergency	should have some idea of what makes things work.	9.294008095546058
11266. a brief course in	hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future	crisis.	9.95372590869866
11267. a sudden high rise in temperature	will turn your pool poison green overnight.	6.799637520143752
11268. the	walls feel slippery.	12.265984240023474
11269. with or without professional	help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself	unless you have a full-time pool nurse.	8.906773278436557
11270. you should see to it	that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter is always clean.	10.82263295642374
11271. a pool is no place for a shut trap.	13.624057442085451
11272. you should firmly insist	that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water.	10.195084471132203
11273. when shed	they leave rust marks.	10.291446399425691
11274. you can hope against hope that come spring	cleaning your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing	and furbishing.	8.87874668845839
11275. many hours of spring cleaning	will be saved however if you remove the main drain grate when you	close the pool season in the fall.	6.669635707675317
11276. as the pool is emptied stand by	to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet.	11.143259556750643
11277. much of	the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp but requires dynamite	if allowed to dry.	6.428405467672415
11278. if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe you may	easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out.	10.632687532735007
11279. of course when	your 6-inch torrent of water is released it may cause a lot of comment	as it passes through or by neighboring properties.	7.296540155605569
11280. do not forget	this possibility.	19.53012386229734
11281. if your pool is located on or near sloping	ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable	than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping	out the water and then scooping out all the debris.	7.633113110506477
11282. it may be	true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene but lights also attract	all the insect life for miles around.	10.341742024211808
11283. once on the water these	little visitors seldom leave and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming	problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those	present.	7.689077806660413
11284. often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light	you need at much less expense.	8.715081837524904
11285. our experience has taught	us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from pipes to	brushes.	7.985350163111015
11286. follow pool-care instructions to the letter and be sure that one	person is regularly responsible for each aspect	of the job with no chance for claiming it wasn't my turn.	7.670649649263244
11287. never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves-	even if the little boys do want to play space ship.	6.14196868690126
11288. you may find yourself	hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running	out even while you are putting it in.	11.419452347301466
11289. draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania.	8.95685168901894
11290. any house built now below that line without air conditioning	will be obsolete in 10 years.	8.1277123384172
11291. fortunately it is the fha	which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment	of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired	with a minimum of financial stress.	7.669144656808273
11292. even if you live above that line	the fha will back you for they have decided that the inclusion	of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should	be encouraged.	10.443724063773795
11293. new simplified packaged units recently devised	prefabricated glass-fiber ducts and improved add-on techniques make	it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as	little as $600 to $900.	3.880241734384078
11294. two men can often do the installation in a	day.	12.381191237212736
11295. you can install it yourself- this is a central system that will	cool every part of your house.	8.294401265776647
11296. its upkeep?	15.727320716068123
11297.  no less an authority	than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes	possible more than offset its operating costs.	6.2033181022429185
11298. home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days	of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted.	10.063121653548562
11299. we know	now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually	desirable and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.	5.962152659938221
11300. we know too that health is never harmed by summer cooling.	12.93159460567062
11301. on the	contrary there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills.	8.026316816745414
11302. the filtered	air benefits allergies asthma sinus hay fever.	9.336024222416372
11303. control of temperature	and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.	7.53035030991177
11304. heart conditions	and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive	heat.	9.401693013198285
11305. the cleaner air means	less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry cleaners lighter	loads for the washing machine.	6.567838922172936
11306. the need for reupholstering redecorating	repainting becomes more infrequent.	15.927154112791808
11307. clothes hold their shape	better and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.	5.671797288860656
11308. it	will improve your disposition.	11.492594054030183
11309. when you're less fatigued things	just naturally look brighter.	5.154409650977491
11310. the children can have their daytime naps	and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.	9.636638546027761
11311. you'll sleep longer and better too awake refreshed and free of	hot weather nerves.	3.477492032415083
11312. you can forget about screens and leave the	storm windows up all year around.	11.773163147168555
11313. best of all central air conditioning	is something you can afford.	8.495821768015759
11314. like its long-lived cousin	the refrigerator a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years	for any	house.	10.168114754619173
11315. colonial	or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed.	6.764879222886599
11316. the	equipment won't take up valuable space either.	5.908206334943843
11317. it can go in out-of-the-way	waste space.	14.092670991888122
11318. but there's no denying that the easiest	and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning	is when you build.	6.262168524033601
11319. if that's done the house can be designed	and oriented for best operation and this can mean savings both in the	size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.	7.930770788234958
11320. if you	can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building	by all means make provision for its easy adding later.	8.027206938310174
11321. manufacturers	have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your	savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.	6.032158094208232
11322. if your	house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of	it.	13.331586659813423
11323. this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system	for your regular heating ductwork filters and furnace blower do double	duty for cooling.	6.364324054800765
11324. you can get year-'round air conditioners in the	same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or	low boy horizontal or counterflow.	8.668715175921758
11325. the units can be installed in basement	attic crawlspace or in a closet located in the living area.	8.89777174384723
11326. the	cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet.	9.844694143977858
11327. from the coil	small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set	in the yard garage carport or basement.	6.470838210760854
11328. if you plan to add	cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for.	13.341611836285596
11329. be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.	10.856964459003347
11330. they may be inaccessible later.	19.39628569965818
11331. be sure your ducts and blower are	big enough to handle cooling.	9.698621995321433
11332. this is especially important if you	live in a mild-winter zone.	13.44653524746238
11333. be sure you get a perimeter heating system	and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for	heating.	10.322358012230943
11334. you can get a hot water system that will also work	for cooling your house.	12.816089720848101
11335. for cooling chilled water is circulated instead	of hot water.	8.147327343318542
11336. instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating	units each with its own thermostat.	8.383406378607726
11337. these systems are more expensive	than year-'round forced air systems.	5.627751601242792
11338. the minimum cost for an average	one-story 7-room house with basement is likely to run $1500 above	the cost of the heating alone.	7.48665210984644
11339. if the problems	of combining cooling with your heating are knotty it may be cheaper	to plan on a completely separate cooling system.	7.827712663759115
11340. the simplest kind	of separate system uses a single self-contained unit.	9.30214628480726
11341. it is in effect	an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts	to distribute the cooled cleaned dehumidified air where it is wanted.	7.439755773634341
11342. in a long rambling ranch two such units can be installed	one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone.	11.87904580752198
11343. in a two-story	house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first	floor another in the attic to cool the second.	7.4747055749393665
11344. in each case having	separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of	permitting individual zone control.	11.520636495484421
11345. one of the	more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched	to heating.	11.648675136203755
11346. as you know a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping	the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors.	11.025054324523296
11347. a relatively	simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine	literally runs backward and the heat is extracted from outdoor air	and turned indoors.	6.122787668976541
11348. up until recently this heat pump method	of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when	outside temperatures were above 40 degrees.	8.993431781109534
11349. now the machine has been	improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat	at temperatures down to 15 degrees.	8.214528459915138
11350. you can get this added heating	feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.	11.441306636248909
11351. consider it as a standby setup at negligible cost for those	emergencies when the furnace quits a blizzard holds up fuel delivery	or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start	up your whole heating plant.	4.528000844045936
11352. how large	a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends	on a variety of factors.	10.930591421669435
11353. among other things besides the nature of	your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from	the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup	of your family.	6.912880257109053
11354. families with children usually don't want the house	quite so cool.	5.904049548758775
11355. if you are a party thrower you may need added capacity.	12.75060089011762
11356. the body is a heat machine and 20 to 25 guests can easily double	your cooling load.	11.688171435168899
11357. cooling requirements are best expressed in	terms of btu's.	7.180771917547802
11358. a btu is a unit of heat and the btu	rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can	pump out of your house in an hour.	11.25769854025079
11359. a very rough rule of thumb is	that under favorable conditions you'll need 15 btu's of cooling	for every square foot of your house.	4.720103665464135
11360. this is if outdoor temperatures	have a high average of 95 degrees.	13.163495056921368
11361. you'll need more if the high	average is above that less if it's below.	2.8985577140810315
11362. coolers are also	rated by tons.	9.767045493978214
11363. a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by	melting a ton of ice.	8.489677998990244
11364. by accepted definition a 1-ton conditioner will	provide 12000 btu of cooling in one hour.	7.3757721425498195
11365. you may find	a conditioner rated by horsepower.	11.125791699542013
11366. it is generally an inaccurate	method of rating for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor	and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll	get.	11.584766529999659
11367. a 1-hp conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness	from under 8000 btu to well over 10000 btu.	5.4822978439909384
11368. the	safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit	you need rather than trying to do this yourself.	13.501501441437322
11369. don't urge	your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be	sure you have enough.	4.431015841773107
11370. better to have your equipment slightly undersized	than too big.	11.259577169115191
11371. here's why:   reducing humidity is often	as important as cooling.	4.0929230011731645
11372. an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly	then shut down for a long period.	9.717327086340404
11373. before it cycles on again humidity	can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature	is still low.	7.735341460671455
11374. with a unit of the right size a compressor will	run continuously during hot weather reducing humidity as evenly as it	does temperature.	10.254508547786946
11375. attention to details can	cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.	7.480550219002329
11376. a well-designed 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled	and heated for as little as $128 a year or $11 a month.	6.095294108025461
11377. if you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily your unit	will have less heat to remove.	7.664509421141246
11378. keep the direct sun from reaching the	house and you've won the first battle.	7.4203921314622105
11379. in a new house generous roof	overhangs are a logical and effective solution.	9.170798251447678
11380. if the house you plan	to buy or build won't have big overhangs you can still do a fair	job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed	trellises fences and awnings.	7.696358117452034
11381. shade trees too are a big help	so keep them if you can.	6.952871431378107
11382. drawn blinds and draperies do some good	but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.	9.693784383601262
11383. the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater	its heat impact.	7.598615738630121
11384. the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence	how much cooling you're going to need.	8.566615339521165
11385. a shift in the walls	or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more obliquely can	save you money.	7.562664271431654
11386. you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the	sun double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.	9.366784934341066
11387. restrict	large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house.	10.154680503484848
11388. they're easier to shade there.	4.337725373418925
11389. an attic space above insulation makes	a house easier to cool.	6.907624005727351
11390. you'll even gain by putting your water	heater outside the conditioned space and using an electric range instead	of a gas one.	5.221215646122266
11391. gas adds to the moisture load.	9.46055656616741
11392. insulate weatherstrip	double-glaze to the maximum.	7.301502449738308
11393. in insulation the numbers to	remember are 6-4-2.	9.491397793894938
11394. they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation	in the ceiling 4 inches in the side walls 2 inches in the floors.	10.454333783533727
11395. such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling	installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in	heating and cooling.	5.857907916085916
11396. a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50	per cent.	7.460214546543613
11397. it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu	in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary btu	is worth attention.	10.984015973307867
11398. you'll foil them in droves along with	their pal humidity by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan a	bathroom ventilator for when you shower and an outside vent for the	clothes drier.	5.585070771027719
11399. it's no use pretending	that all conditioners are quiet but the noise they produce can	be kept to a minimum.	3.472055081000831
11400. good workmanship is important in the installation	so if you're doing your own contracting don't award the job on	the basis of price alone.	5.757845967413763
11401. avoid attic placement directly above	a bedroom.	7.1673655525822255
11402. most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning.	16.405818908877226
11403. this is particularly true in site selection.	19.722302242193802
11404. you must know before	you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you	must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites	are needed.	8.95140025577598
11405. with such a program you can make constructive selections	of the best sites available.	10.216934575356479
11406. begin the examination of a site	with a good map and aerial photos if possible.	8.66276398957266
11407. these are becoming more	and more available through the work of counties and other government	agencies.	8.703971803203531
11408. the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal	government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural	features of the site.	9.522644603142966
11409. these are inexpensive and available from the u	s geological society washington 25 d c.	8.065106262641178
11410. in recent	years many counties and the u s forest service have taken	aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning	use.	13.87675364973916
11411. most counties also have maps available from the county engineer	showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office	showing ownerships of land.	6.0737674869385945
11412. inspect the site in the field during	the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for	recreation.	12.83528214823985
11413. this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the	climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests	etcetera which vary greatly with the seasons.	9.736802783461721
11414. it is usually helpful	to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location	of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site.	13.282415649426303
11415. these	are a great aid for planning use back at the office.	8.471715064636808
11416. for	site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced	park planner to carry through the study.	8.827327885778846
11417. however there is also much	to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are	available and interested in recreation.	9.00429830606533
11418. county judges commissioners	engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a	long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions	to offer from their varied professional experiences.	8.918798945012956
11419. a visit to the site	by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify	opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.	7.91349358606095
11420. how much study is required?	17.211968261319605
11421.  this of course depends on	the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator	and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.	9.191989430451798
11422. it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick	judgment	of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone.	14.347435846828786
11423. usually	there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.	6.45181421218818
11424. a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance	today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little	development or water.	10.510319823187638
11425. the same is true of areas which at first look	good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually	be poor areas to develop for general public use.	7.845151152526667
11426. in looking for	the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information	to compare the site with others.	11.2088193624096
11427. you need answers to four important	questions.	13.948458058628606
11428. what are the existing recreation features?	16.310556249056432
11429. 	how well can the site be developed?	9.024343481021429
11430.     how useful	will it be to the public?	14.089915416946118
11431.     is this site available?	14.341652019190805
11432. 	check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests	already existing at the site.	11.22291038533031
11433. naturally a park site with scenic	views a good lake trees and sand dunes will attract more people	than a nearby area with only trees and dunes.	5.871512691175231
11434. frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different	from the same amount of frontage on polluted water.	8.891610019520112
11435. some recreation	features such as scenic values and water interest also have greater	overall value than other interests.	7.111850315586481
11436. one of the most desirable	features for a park are beautiful views or scenery.	15.415345297323084
11437. it may be distant	views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a	small lake colorful rock formations or unusual trees.	7.4116347961332885
11438. a site which	overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating	traffic.	10.569673742810908
11439. an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf	rolling in on a beach.	8.722562660567014
11440. a site may also be attractive just through	the beauty of its trees and shrubs.	12.024784188144336
11441. note extent of these interests and	how available they will be for the public to enjoy.	9.445084654569609
11442. water interest	is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation	site.	13.728535661319896
11443. most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.	7.36507716396973
11444. this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake	provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation	activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports.	8.459545213511008
11445. a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract	the greatest picnic and camping use.	8.574217469817109
11446. it also cools the air in summer	and nourishes the trees and wild life.	11.887561652899699
11447. the amount of water	frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation	afforded by it are important.	12.63168277321969
11448. a restricted frontage may be too crowded	an area for public use.	10.441628758521093
11449. the quantity of water flow may be critical;	a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant	or dry in late summer.	6.460230664984924
11450. if the site is on a reservoir the level	of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be	studied.	10.86872488123029
11451. check the quality of the water.	15.541436812886294
11452. a stream which has all of	its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation	practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one	passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area.	7.840495154363458
11453. other	factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it	supports wave action flooding etcetera will affect its recreation	value.	6.554565467195275
11454. other natural features which can be of high interest	are the forests canyons mountains deserts seacoast beaches sand	dunes waterfalls springs etcetera with which the area is blessed.	8.638762734448923
11455. just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which	are of national or state significance counties should seek out these	features which are distinctive of their area.	6.804948297357682
11456. although the site may	not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities	to include them as additional interest to the site.	9.935728841103746
11457. the route to the	park may lead people past them or display views of them.	7.581495412677564
11458. a group of	native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can	be featured at the site.	10.815059385462762
11459. the fish animals and birds which	may be found at the site are another interest.	8.621813113015527
11460. fishing interest calls	for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they	are available and the stocking program of the fish commission.	9.011723010929323
11461. animals	may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas.	8.033524034810945
11462. the	site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its	own resident bird life.	9.74570812080977
11463. clams crabs and other marine life may add	interest at coastal areas.	5.853593402493078
11464. each area has its own historical	interests with which much can be done.	10.011609782695569
11465. park visitors are always	eager to learn more about the area they are in.	7.302040930491485
11466. the historical sign	tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the	original historical items or places themselves which still have the	character of the period covered.	8.86227496731846
11467. notice should be taken of unusual rock	formations deposits or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.	4.690844548285937
11468. those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area	can add geological interest to the recreation sites.	7.672801602627098
11469. an old shipwreck	a high dam an old covered bridge a place to find agates or other	semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest.	6.419857592943815
11470. some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian	village sites or hunting areas caves artifacts etcetera.	8.629180231462758
11471. how well can the site be developed?	14.07763186845369
11472.  look at the physical features	of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done	to correct the faults and what it will cost to make the area meet your	needs in comparison to other sites.	10.622402530694313
11473. many things need to be checked:	- the size of the area alone can be a determining	factor.	9.292449422119459
11474. an area may be too small for the needs of the project.	16.54916118226389
11475. areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample	space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges	to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.	7.381818264661491
11476. acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation	areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical	to operate one large area than several small ones.	9.376049200422623
11477. shape	of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the	development.	10.185496087576757
11478. a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient	in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width	in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide.	9.172785604075855
11479. this	is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your	buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions.	8.476098484412477
11480. however a	narrow strip may be very practical for small developments or to provide	additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail or include	scenic strips within the park unit.	7.161690913468711
11481. the values	of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands	ownership and use of the land and the utilities available there.	10.483879824648543
11482. for	instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national	forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next	to an industrial plant might not.	7.507372769408346
11483. the utilities available nearby may	provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the	site.	8.55415951862704
11484. check the	elevation of the ground degree and direction of slopes drainage rock	outcrops topsoil types and quality as well as subsoil.	10.213522592750815
11485. nearly level	areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas ballfields	etcetera.	7.498354763670716
11486. determine how much topography limits useful area or what	the costs of earth moving or grading might be.	8.471486610153597
11487. in addition	to its recreation interests water is needed for drinking sanitation	and irrigation.	8.903131336700795
11488. the quantity and quality of water sources is	often a big factor in site selection.	13.592981506965181
11489. the area may provide good springs	or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines.	7.723099737962258
11490. figure	the cost of providing water to the use areas.	14.197923038250284
11491. the	existing plant growth calls for thorough checking.	7.055645074560738
11492. look at the trees	as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy	they are the problems of maintenance fire hazards wind throw	etcetera.	11.335962798300326
11493. an area may have been partially logged and requires	removal of stumps or clean up.	7.695749341174242
11494. some shrubs may be of good landscaping	value other areas of brush may need to be cleared.	11.83164327499136
11495. the extent and location	of open areas is noted.	8.834162566462092
11496. how much will wind	rain sun and temperature affect the use?	12.718354378433888
11497.  an area sheltered from	strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use.	7.6047767577575245
11498. the direction	velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how	they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation	of the area.	8.892862365069059
11499. lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for	the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable.	7.077122188833746
11500. sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography	or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or	whatever may be most desirable for the use intended.	10.342212941202554
11501. some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings	roads utilities cleared land etcetera which may raise the cost of	the site.	6.892948799567953
11502. your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his	70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is	accepted with pleasure because i admire the music of prokofieff;	and with sober purpose because the development of prokofieff personifies	in many ways the course of music in the union of soviet socialist	republics.	8.902362826187279
11503. the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the	united states of america was gay witty mercurial full of pranks	and bonheur- and very capable as a professional musician.	6.68079750672967
11504. these	qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic	haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world	war 1 era.	7.314828612794722
11505. prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor	in america was indeed brilliant.	3.787445116474157
11506. prokofieff's classical	symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted	and well-trained musician still in his twenties.	5.397475294060526
11507. to the traditionalists	it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the neo-classicists	it was a challenge to the pre-war world.	5.285196681522154
11508. what was it to prokofieff?	18.917828876225062
11509. 	a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-century ideas; a trial	balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant piece	de resistance?	3.9337787769301493
11510.  certainly its composer was an ascending star	on a new world horizon.	10.039084769063722
11511. i heard the classical symphony	for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927.	9.426771667152282
11512. all musical paris was there.	12.980836019012205
11513. some musicians were enthusiastic some	skeptical.	9.263014042298078
11514. i myself was one of the skeptics.	22.72096933022323
11515. i remember	ernest bloch in the foyer shouting in his high-pitched voice:	h it may be a tour de force mais mon dieu can anyone take	this music seriously?	5.399978000585383
11516.    the answer is yes! certainly	america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously	and with a good deal of pleasure.	10.810864598440904
11517. his life-long friend serge	koussevitzky gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances	in boston new york and washington d c to which	he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation.	5.609387467872988
11518. chicago was	also a welcome host: there in 1921 prokofieff conducted the world	premiere of the love for three oranges and played the first	performance of his third piano concerto.	7.56358358880533
11519. uncle sam was indeed	a rich uncle to prokofieff in those opulent post-war victory	years of peace and prosperity bold speculations and extravaganzas enjoyment	and pleasure: the golden twenties.	4.750748298336193
11520. we attended the	premieres of his concertos symphonies and suites; we studied taught	and performed his piano sonatas chamber music gavottes and marches;	we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.	6.444284604657824
11521. we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as	a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers.	6.890842654396754
11522. nevertheless prokofieff was much influenced by paris during	the twenties: the paris which was the artistic center of the western	world- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated-	the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich	america- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff stravinsky koussevitzky	cocteau picasso- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism	and ultramodern art- the paris sympathique which took young	composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.	4.992905999741024
11523. so young prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland;	in the spacious hunting grounds of uncle sam; in the exciting	salons of his lovely brilliant paris- mistress of gaiety-	excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone color	dance design and thought.	3.4274971428374763
11524. meanwhile three great terrible	forces were coagulating and crystallizing.	8.71273728989673
11525. in this world-wide conscription	of men minds and machines prokofieff was recalled to his	native land.	6.649524632289013
11526. the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts	of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving peoples of the	capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist	tyranny into cringing submission.	7.478342672974812
11527. after this holocaust a changing world	occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries new	treaties and governments new goals and methods and the age-old fears	of aggression	and subjugation- hunger and exposure.	4.698298972235039
11528. in this	changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create	for	large national purpose.	10.888214727918815
11529. here this happy roving son of good fortune	proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic	order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.	6.10302223857407
11530. here prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism-	producing music for the masses.	8.139760251525631
11531. it is at this point in his life	that the mature prokofieff emerges.	14.02078739881337
11532. one might have expected that	such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative	flair of a composer especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.	8.929141141186872
11533. he accepted the environment	of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his	early promise.	6.0501555389590616
11534. by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his	people: i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom but at	the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the	accepted methods of harmony and melody.	7.811348441945676
11535. this is precisely what makes	lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must	be new not old.	8.204355488204788
11536. how right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural	defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not	or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism.	8.516637191398388
11537. and	with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words- with	torrents of powerful music.	4.847807438765485
11538. compare the vast difference in scope and	beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and	his big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony; or the	love for three oranges with the wonderful imaginative	colorful and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet	the stone flower.	6.47320442226088
11539. this masterpiece has gaiety too but it is	the gaiety of dancing people: earthy salty and humorous.	5.708255688591327
11540. of	course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived	them.	10.149042872108753
11541. the early works were conceived for a sophisticated international	audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way	of life for fellow citizens.	6.116846672164655
11542. however in all of prokofieff's music	young or mature we find his profile- his signature- his	craftsman's attitude.	7.194406483955268
11543. prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the	cause of experimentation per se.	7.1636185618841
11544. in orchestration he stretches	the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination	for color.	9.821740895362382
11545. his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.	8.829218874480027
11546. his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and	love songs is captivating: witty clever adroit and subtle.	6.640065341645458
11547. his	counterpoint is pertinent skillful and rarely thick.	6.423596493322134
11548. also	it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic	modulations the brilliant orchestrations the adroitness for evading	the heaviness of figured bass the skill in florid counterpoint	were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical	dramas of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound	was required.	7.453402588198324
11549. that prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes	seem professionally routine to our ears may or may not indicate that	he was less of an original than we prefer to believe.	6.097103104929036
11550. need for	novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability.	10.244019922546958
11551. prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of	his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which	the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually	added and integrated.	5.75818412488491
11552. at this date it seems probable that the	name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history	as an effective traditionalist who was fully aware of the lure and danger	of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose; yet	was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics.	8.059107866256392
11553. certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared	him to the western world- not his experimentations.	7.09926976924672
11554. so	prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a	rich reward from them.	8.583119537212172
11555. nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would	have done better or even as well under different circumstances.	8.247333656679581
11556. his fellow-countryman igor stravinsky certainly did not.	7.5237794580318305
11557. why did	prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity while stravinsky	dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?	7.3484600885705085
11558. 	i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff's own words:	the clarity must be new not old.	8.890939688270322
11559. when prokofieff forged his	new clarity of lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose	he shaped his talents to his purpose.	6.885708888431767
11560. when stravinsky	shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many salons	many dialectics many personalities he tried to refashion himself	into a stylist of many styles determined by many disparate cultures.	8.457995829331361
11561. prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own	people- by the compass of their national ideas.	6.636975423916419
11562. but stravinsky	was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting.	11.800651779321926
11563. in	all his miscalculations stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder	of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations-	representing many peoples time periods and styles- into his own	music by warping the harmony melody or form to verify his own experiments.	4.27843969406169
11564. because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic	materials and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant petruchka	his savage sacre du printemps his incisive les noces-	the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical	direction for which his native talents were predisposed.	6.952907077358112
11565. but	time is running out and many of stravinsky's admirers begin to fear	that he will never find terra firma.	6.097125070642065
11566. his various aesthetic postulates	remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: supra-expressionism	neo-paganism neo-classicism neo-romanticism	neo-jazz neo-ecclesiasticism neo-popularism and most recently	post-serialism- all competing with each other within one composer!	what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! meager	and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty	protagonist;	a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem	; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic	jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes	from his old music might be used for popular american commercial	songs! stravinsky nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic	bird flitting from one abandoned nest to another searching for	a home.	4.816182728071108
11567. how differently prokofieff's life unfolded.	6.969186143231706
11568. prokofieff	was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing	world without losing his particular force and direction.	7.747935432120883
11569. in the process	his native endowments were stretched strengthened and disciplined	to serve their human purpose.	7.264201914698264
11570. with a large and circumspect	20th-century technique he wove the materials of national heroes and	events national folklore and children's fairy tales- slavic dances	and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his	people well and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large.	6.646889421253714
11571. of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical	feat prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind	him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras opera and ballet	companies; choruses chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings;	broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences.	4.779736425060124
11572. it	must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many	of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic	security and cultural opportunities incisive idioms social fermentations	for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large	body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.	6.22511645873915
11573. thus	in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced	one of the great composers of the twentieth century.	7.94798303614954
11574. that his moods	even in his early years are those of his people does him honor	as his music honors those who inspired it.	10.663023839680891
11575. that he mastered every aspect	of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary	judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous	pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;	and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-century	evidence of the effectiveness of evolution based on a broad	traditionalism for the creative art of music.	5.886883077280041
11576. april 10 marked a memorable date in new york's musical history-	indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states.	6.904019308038909
11577. on that date the musicians emergency fund organized to furnish	employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the	depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes	in the stock market crash observed its 30th anniversary.	6.250230592621083
11578. roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction	has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth	century especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell	cotman.	7.7206471608473946
11579. and like this english master mason realizes his subjects	in large simplified masses which though they seem effortless are	in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough	distillation of the natural form that inspired them.	6.3320192295282975
11580. as a	boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the	out-of-doors its tang of weather its change of seasons its variable	moods.	7.5052395336512
11581. his father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape	painter took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions and imparted	to them his knowledge and love of nature.	5.973873113439632
11582. out of this background of	hunting and fishing it was only natural that roy first painted subjects	he knew best: hunters in the field fishermen in the stream ducks	and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of	weather landscape.	7.870071863460686
11583. it is this subject matter that has brought mason	a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen but it is his exceptional	performance with this motif that commends him to artists and	discerning collectors.	8.402233452572704
11584. mason had to earn the privilege of devoting	himself exclusively to painting.	10.205749539013603
11585. like many others he had to work	hard long hours in a struggling family business which though it was	allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals-	bore no relation to the painting of pictures.	5.963399370138889
11586. but it did teach	roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years	he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia.	10.074565460799361
11587. on the death of their father they returned to their home	in batavia new york.	11.205306439852077
11588. after more years of concentrated effort roy	and his brother max finally established a thriving family business	at the old stand.	8.643539292843652
11589. during all this time roy continued to paint	first only on weekends and then as the family business permitted	for longer periods.	8.12205110741798
11590. gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether	and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter	except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions.	9.089411854399202
11591. but even	on these the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!	except for a rich friendship with the painter chauncey ryder	who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and	this was limited to a few lessons though the two artists often went on	painting trips together- roy developed his art by himself.	5.354808637166108
11592. in the	best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy	and assurance and then to paint.	10.040191950254359
11593. he worked in oil for years before	beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition	and early honors including his election to the academy were for	his essays in the heavier medium.	6.99870063427404
11594. gradually watercolor claimed his greater	affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive	technique.	9.053183725365573
11595. it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason	on numerous occasions mostly in the vicinity of batavia.	9.273122983927324
11596. more often	than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at	a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature	into a composed not imitative painting.	8.365743524277743
11597. what i have observed	time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins	as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color	patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;	and that over-all amazing control of large washes which is the mason	stylemark.	5.559184158038535
11598. finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the	job is done.	8.694855816283743
11599. inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable-	no!   but for the technical fact we have the artist's	own testimony:   of late years i find that i like best to	work out-of-doors.	4.42086511825777
11600. first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in	quarter scale in which i pay particular attention	to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest	light the middle tone and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms	of my subject to these large patterns.	6.86960508183774
11601. if a human figure or wild life	are to be part of the projected final picture i try to place them	in the initial sketch.	8.927393412798313
11602. for me these will belong more completely to	their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage though	i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on	the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.	9.049223808946739
11603. i am thoroughly	convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects	nature will do his composing for him; as a result such pictures are	only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before	him.	6.617449349933477
11604. just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot	is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting	unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.	11.471366966380018
11605. if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain	units in his design often only slightly finer pictures would result.	7.012141160478479
11606. out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other	objects like trees logs and bushes can be traced from the original	sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they	occupy the right position which i call 'clicking'.	9.197712656264027
11607. speed	in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity	and crispness but unless the artist has lots of experience so that	he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketches	and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.	6.525661035736554
11608. if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition	i mean to project equal concern for color.	15.461540291699773
11609. often in working	out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular	passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be	too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed indoors in	a mat.	5.992922039326174
11610. when this occurs i make the change on the sketch or on the	final watercolor- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field.	10.602935338888146
11611. when working from one of my sketches i square it up and	project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.	7.179088892625825
11612. when this linear draft is completed i dust it down to a faint	image.	14.022655604193675
11613. from this point i paint in as direct a manner as possible by	flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage.	8.056682766352548
11614. however first	i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and	design along the lines i have described.	9.031244823159838
11615. then i plan my attack:	the parts i will finish first the range of values the accenting of	minor details- all in all mechanics of producing the finished job	with a maximum of crispness.	5.7582937681637505
11616. the longer i work the more i am sure	that for me at least a workmanlike method is important.	11.212272763131391
11617. trial and	error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles	in the final painting.	6.3967327374280964
11618. as for materials i use the	best available.	14.813692732433264
11619. i work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently	resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue	strain.	8.754454952923586
11620. in my studio i work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper	unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes.	10.226729755943992
11621. i have	used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers but prefer an english	make rough surface in 400-pound weight.	5.159991228485744
11622. after selecting a sheet	and inspecting it for flaws	i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with	clean cold water.	9.534373302497102
11623. then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that	it will lie flat as a board.	6.813492156386593
11624. in addition to the usual tools	i make constant use of cleansing tissue not only to wipe my brushes	but to mop up certain areas to soften edges and to open up lights	in dark washes.	9.81961589295466
11625. the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that	it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the	watercolorist.	8.222794120543346
11626. i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large	washes in the studio.	8.582731795976107
11627. my brushes are different from those used	by most watercolorists for i combine the sable and the bristle.	6.214568438256692
11628. the	red sables are 8; two riggers 6 and 10; and a very large	flat wash brush.	5.374616731086403
11629. the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half	inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.	5.998860329965599
11630. my usual palette	consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson orange raw sienna	raw umber burnt sienna sepia cerulean blue cobalt blue french	ultramarine blue winsor green hooker's green 2 cadmium yellow	pale yellow ochre payne's gray charcoal gray davy's gray	and ivory black.	4.177452067307183
11631. in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason	the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness	yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration	here.	6.769850272137206
11632. true a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis	of nature rather than a detailed inventory.	9.146940610365853
11633. unlike many decorative patterns	that present a static flat convention this artist's pictures	are full of atmosphere and climate.	4.8416054169811575
11634. long observation has taught	mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes:	a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents	or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the	major motif; and a background usually a silhouetted form foiled against	the sky.	5.743743088516392
11635. in following this general principle mason provides the	observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background	and the illusion of depth is instantly created.	6.191665384096586
11636. when painting	mason's physical eyes are half-closed while his mind's eye	is wide open and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression	he wishes to convey.	6.46679416670444
11637. he does not insist on telling all he knows about	any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw	on his memory his imagination his nostalgia.	6.239826072151669
11638. it is for this	reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition	of place for their enjoyment.	11.699510487186688
11639. his pictures generalize though	they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms	of weather skies earth and people.	5.429193153591706
11640. by dealing with common landscape	in an uncommon way roy mason has found a particular niche in american	landscape art.	8.573475354143303
11641. living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience	of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor	a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor	the creator of it all.	6.749460118133521
11642. the artist was born in gilbert mills	new york in 1886 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved	to california he lived in western new york in batavia.	12.302732285809412
11643. when	i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march	15th i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for	a watercolorist: the water sign of pisces.	6.188640837707494
11644. and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes and	how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again	in his natal month of march!   over the years beginning in	1929 mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold	medals; two ranger fund purchase awards; the joseph pennell	memorial medal; two american watercolor society prizes; the blair	purchase prize for watercolor art institute of chicago;	and others in buffalo new york chautauqua new haven rochester	rockport and most recently the $300 prize for a watercolor at	the laguna beach art association   he was elected to the national	academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931	and elevated to academicianship in 1940.	5.948813933890214
11645. other memberships	include the american watercolor society philadelphia water	color club allied artists of america audubon artists baltimore	watercolor society.	6.014717164008502
11646. the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts	in the 1960 olympics for one reason- they were better.	8.255301767498075
11647. they were	better trained better looking better built better disciplined h	and something else- they were better dancers.	5.701331326952192
11648. our athletes are	only just beginning to learn that they must study dance.	11.342812828045522
11649. the russians	are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.	7.682168305945139
11650. but why gymnastics at all?	18.536940113102315
11651.  and is the sport really important?	13.685356511010742
11652. 	after all we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics	competition.	10.957066038628911
11653. but if it is important what can we do to improve ourselves?	17.19944553268675
11654. 	it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem	for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very	important things to learn from gymnastics.	8.398643707245844
11655. taking first things	first let's understand the sport called gymnastics.	5.392825977699105
11656. it is made up	of tumbling which might be said to start with a somersault run through	such stunts as headstands handstands cartwheels backbends and	culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists	h and apparatus work.	9.599715478415504
11657. the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a	common sight in american gyms but about 1930 it was dropped in favor	of games.	6.431985893863755
11658. the parallel bars horse buck springboard horizontal bar	rings and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball	volleyball basketball and football.	8.1092414028815
11659. but the russians use	gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because	it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance.	8.483775721126799
11660. the	gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination timing	rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection.	7.984829401487083
11661. in short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great	deal of character as well.	10.612281248907639
11662. the addition of endurance training later	when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury	provides that final quality that makes the top athlete soldier	or citizen.	9.46039404918624
11663. another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that	it can be started very early in life.	6.967943950472863
11664. could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days.	11.029215285900877
11665. in most sports as in most walks of life the angels are on the side	of those who begin young and the russian competitor of 16 has at	least thirteen years of training behind him.	7.942750114589131
11666. the american is very lucky	if he has three.	12.814966022645175
11667. if a nation wished to get a head start in	physical fitness over all other nations it would start its kindergarten	students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus	eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools.	8.892523422109681
11668. first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension	since action relieves both.	13.285698833319548
11669. oddly enough it is proven that there	would be less reading difficulty.	7.621855076924996
11670. certainly there would be less anxiety	fewer accidents	and higher scholastic averages since alert children work better.	9.81873823083745
11671. russia knows this and that is why there were over 800000 competing	for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team.	8.508447758579214
11672. eighty	thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.	10.401824931373431
11673. we	could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.	6.723313341821036
11674. and what has dancing to do with all this?	19.165364687897046
11675.  a great deal.	14.075262871960907
11676. russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous	training on apparatus.	6.438715370234181
11677. well-stretched trained in posture and coordinated	movement and wedded to rhythm they presented the audiences	in	rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic	contest.	6.311263823537135
11678. american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.	9.672570781732517
11679. they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing	with incredible grace.	7.141813154735838
11680. they were further stripped of old wive's	tales	by seeing the slender lovely russian girls performing feats requiring	tremendous strength h and with not one bulging muscle.	7.250766663486409
11681. president	kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation.	7.89790871360329
11682. if	we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never	manage it.	9.33251433672965
11683. to be fit one has to start early with young children	and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher	of dance.	7.2804049607325
11684. if the dance teachers of america make it their business	to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come	some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much	ahead.	9.855097309630207
11685. school teachers all too unprepared for the job they must do	will need demonstrators.	7.89282176151621
11686. there should be youngsters who know how to do	a headstand and also how to help other children learn it.	13.520277286865644
11687. they should	know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for	the sports we will demand be taught.	6.431043801994496
11688. dance teachers can respond	to president kennedy's request not only through their regular	dance work but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes	for strength and flexibility.	6.680707391090208
11689. very little in today's living	provides the strength we need h and nothing provides the flexibility.	5.321238057260128
11690. they often fail however to develop	real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength.	9.254276404166028
11691. ask any group	of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results	considering the amount of physical training they have had will be	very disappointing.	5.073881838136743
11692. even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.	14.33728886000341
11693. this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of	the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once and	that english school girls outdo them in almost every test	.	5.040400153446636
11694. the only area in which american boys hold their own	is the baseball throw.	11.88011122844858
11695. for arm and shoulder	strength a chinning bar is recommended.	7.56775390766206
11696. it should be installed over	a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed	under it a little to one side.	13.323132857846257
11697. those children who can chin themselves	should be told to do one chin up each time they pass under it.	6.848287043146984
11698. those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the	top of the chin let themselves slowly down.	10.598186096036457
11699. when they can take	ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to	chin up.	10.07233383494878
11700. parents should be informed about this system and encouraged	to do the same with the whole family at home.	10.808576274221227
11701. arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with	the horse kick.	6.0620027385806265
11702. start on hands and feet.	20.67117578745527
11703. keeping the hands in	the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm.	7.810054793545074
11704. after this has	become easy use slower and slower rhythms kicking higher and higher.	9.998901716294466
11705. follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on	all fours kicking as high as possible.	8.83236870088105
11706. push-ups are	essential but few have the strength for them at first.	9.16336513625844
11707. start on the	knees in a large circle.	12.162049630791904
11708. fall slowly forward onto the hands and let	the body down to rest on the floor.	11.46381630586274
11709. push back up and repeat.	12.734802908870382
11710. do this	exercise six times each class period.	12.240293580810171
11711. as strength improves start in	a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward.	6.887354843087363
11712. start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength	improves fall farther and farther out.	12.127200227800454
11713. try to push back to the stand	position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes	from the hands.	7.856840563721996
11714. the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the	top of the push-up with legs spread wide.	7.818009190101451
11715. let the body down slowly	taking at least five seconds for the letting down.	8.895094311704021
11716. five of these	done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up.	11.520070370044268
11717. handstands come after arms chest and shoulders	have developed at least a minimum of strength.	7.228884864810104
11718. of course those	who have developed more will find them easier.	14.625028681773376
11719. start with the class	standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended	a little way into the circle.	8.999379611495293
11720. at first each child should do a kick	up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work	alone and those who need help.	10.98906559237302
11721. drop both hands to the floor and at the	same time kick the right foot up in back.	9.423560320043087
11722. the left will follow at	once.	16.4720976821287
11723. the right will land first followed by the left.	10.565226388873594
11724. return to the	standing position.	13.941847455686199
11725. care should be taken to see that the hands are placed	on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot	is brought as close to the hands as possible.	9.39961690308498
11726. this will prevent flat	falls and toe injuries.	13.172226101820492
11727. bare feet are better for such work than any	form of slipper.	7.1188165710634435
11728. eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough	so that the teacher can catch the leading leg.	10.38877973730702
11729. the child should	then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and tighten the	seat muscles.	6.920297585819938
11730. be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the	hands and that only one foot lands at a time.	13.054892973683861
11731. the backbend	is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and	as with all acrobatics the sooner begun the better the results.	6.630589446688949
11732. have	the class lie supine with knees apart and bent.	10.97494624952944
11733. place flat palms on	either side of the head a few inches away from the ears fingers pointing	toward the shoulders.	7.9573863624390215
11734. arch the back upwards to make a bridge.	11.042785744321769
11735. be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor	rather than toward the ceiling.	9.36455542584056
11736. as flexibility improves the feet will	move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.	12.670207403203808
11737. later this can	be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.	8.520317595046215
11738. to further increase back flexibility work on the back circle.	14.427864072806905
11739. have	the class lie prone.	11.646520460344489
11740. place the hands in front of the chest.	19.52737701605453
11741. keep	the legs straight and the toes pointed.	8.042201714361974
11742. straighten the arms slowly	this arches the back.	8.953345591169455
11743. at the peak of the arch tip the head back and	bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.	8.313725654222177
11744. improvement can be	measured by the lessening distance between toes and head.	8.503538206145178
11745. the last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the	somersault or forward roll.	7.055234471400489
11746. this used to be part of every child's	bag of tricks but few children can do it today; some are actually	incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting	or standing upright.	7.76852076669832
11747. for most small children learning a forward	roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can.	7.993183628669782
11748. after it has	been seen have the child start on a mat on hands and knees	inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require	.	10.871925767077162
11749. he places the hands on either side of the head keeping	the chin down on the chest.	9.824768966675688
11750. he then pushes his seat into the air and	the teacher guides it over.	12.150812765109816
11751. one or two practice runs should be sufficient	for solo.	9.610242563424213
11752. if however the child is weak overweight or afraid	more help will be needed.	11.334689602357043
11753. when the child raises his seat into the air	the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter	what happens the child's performance will be controlled.	5.586121430292633
11754. by lifting	the seat upwards a little the weight is taken off the neck and	the back is kept rounded.	8.788512028040387
11755. these are beginnings but correctly	learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed	by a strong flexible body.	6.458318955208302
11756. even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal the good tumbler	will be a better dancer a better athlete and a human being with	a greater margin of safety in any activity.	9.65244212226728
11757. it is very important	for parents to understand that early training is imperative.	12.343489627682992
11758. and dancing	school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also	contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute	even more.	7.236593380583086
11759. every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual	defense	budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion	of these expenditures go for military electronics.	7.4301602122289045
11760. we have noted how	some electronic techniques developed for the defense effort have evenutally	been used in commerce and industry.	10.223007272587076
11761. the host of novel applications	of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because	of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.	6.462019757626761
11762. when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment	the prospect is staggering.	12.176625148462398
11763. the author has recently studied	the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this	area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.	7.387608305289619
11764. the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be	greater by far than any previous medical discovery.	7.814745412260679
11765. we use the term	bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology	and medical research.	7.8914750126688515
11766. electronics has been applied to medicine	for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine	the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine.	9.51061658056407
11767. recently many	doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage	of bruises	contusions and simple bursitis.	5.926786657734214
11768. commonly used electronic	devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit	tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction	along with radiation counters timers and similar devices.	6.344553057238984
11769. in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application	of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this	is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates.	5.856353327236978
11770. from the wealth	of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques	perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which	appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely	new tools in medical research.	11.731205468954338
11771. many cells bacteria and other microorganisms are transparent to visible	light and must be stained for microscopic investigation.	6.43426961788341
11772. this stain	often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.	9.108365326040579
11773. a completely new insight into living cells and their structure	will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light	with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv	system to view the results.	5.600990792965606
11774. fig 1 is a simplified block	diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical	electronics center of rockefeller institute.	10.575141079883547
11775. by combining the	talents of a medical man dr aterman a biophysicist mr	berkely	and an electronics expert dr zworykin this novel technique	has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding	life processes.	5.358423840330345
11776. three different wavelengths of ultraviolet	radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the	three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources.	8.583256540794858
11777. these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the	rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope.	5.429946464925308
11778. instead	of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the tv camera	does the looking.	8.15308693846436
11779. the microscope and orthicon are both selected	to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all	lenses must be quartz.	7.799528407114584
11780. the video signal is amplified and then	switched in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which	are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of	a second only one wavelength corresponding to red green or blue is	seen.	6.908908215037283
11781. to another the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated	by a synchronous motor.	6.095212783296994
11782. this assembly also supplies a 20-cps	this is the same system	as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded	the present simultaneous system.	6.758770993095448
11783. three separate amplifiers then	drive a 21-inch tricolor tube.	5.33355948015847
11784. the result is a color picture of the	specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet	wavelengths.	13.517922857575178
11785. many of the cells and microorganisms which	are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter	wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum.	7.854375885452776
11786. different parts of these cells	sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often	possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.	10.538675484490948
11787. where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows	or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation	into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail.	6.871009314595281
11788. at the	present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is	primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it.	9.24562723861947
11789. electronically analyzed	the medical title of lobar ventilation	in man by drs c j martin and a c young covers	a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics	to the study of the respiratory process.	6.632544441439435
11790. at the university	of washington medical school the electronics group has developed	the respiratory gas analyzer shown in fig 3.	10.687053437490633
11791. this unit	affectionately dubbed the monster can be wheeled to any convenient	location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's	breathing.	7.166190651554503
11792. in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder	indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper	and lower lobes of one lung the total volume of inhalation per breath	the flow of air from both lobes and the pressure of the two lobes	with respect to each other.	8.742273736220795
11793. usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece	while walking a treadmill standing still or in some other medically	significant position.	6.562374171072773
11794. from the resulting data the doctor can determine	lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.	9.55054910298354
11795. techniques	the original electrocardiograph primarily	indicates irregularities in the heartbeat but today's techniques allow	exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta dimensioning	of the heart and its chambers and a much more detailed study of	each heartbeat.	5.561204567083866
11796. for many of these measurements the chest must be opened	but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.	15.049261800235543
11797. a group of researchers at the university of washington have given	a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques.	9.576375103921205
11798. one simple	method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber	tube filled with mercury around the heart and record the change	in resistance as the tube is stretched.	10.938970999669099
11799. a balanced resistance bridge	and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.	7.152615831013295
11800. sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing	small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel	and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.	10.61268571110964
11801. the travel	time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes	about 16	|msec to traverse 25 mm of tissue.	5.40133493027094
11802. a sonar or radar-type	of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for	body-tissue evaluation.	5.70733427974291
11803. in addition to the heart and aorta successful	measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.	11.226456310589654
11804. the doppler effect using ultrasonic signals can be employed to	measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.	9.774538959994388
11805. a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining	the effective power of the heart itself.	8.890171559981749
11806. it uses both an ultrasonic	dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor	inserted into the bloodstream.	11.579076540302886
11807. the latter measures the heat carried	away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood	flow.	8.528654825846424
11808. it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer mounted	at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left	ventricle to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself.	12.36411474725435
11809. this pressure	measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning	measurement is made.	10.510800817770818
11810. a simplified version of the instrumentation	for this procedure is shown in fig 2.	14.200027303661855
11811. outputs of the two	systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge	followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder.	5.0265012809165865
11812. from this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure	and effective heart power.	9.95272915168906
11813. several	years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule	which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal	pressure data to external receivers.	7.025045749618287
11814. this original capsule contained	a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm in	diameter.	8.972534697390175
11815. battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8	to 30 hours maximum.	7.345734901107632
11816. a refinement of this technique has been described	by drs zworykin and farrar and mr berkely of the medical	electronics center of the rockefeller institute.	9.329255179287873
11817. in this	novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant	circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing	transducer.	7.329851899046219
11818. as shown in fig 4 an external antenna is placed over	or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc	bursts.	11.01587625685898
11819. the energy received by the pill causes the resonant	circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes	place at the resonant frequency of the pill.	6.7701606215091275
11820. these frequencies	are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst	of transmitted energy and after the pill has been calibrated	precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.	7.71797290933265
11821. one of	the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the	patient for several days permitting observation under natural conditions.	7.917452675728333
11822. applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are	planned for future experiments.	9.12460357029116
11823. one	of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine	detection is in the exploration of the human body.	8.90626692149769
11824. our readers	are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent	out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.	9.841168273660347
11825. various	methods of pulsing scanning and displaying these sound waves are used	to detect submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water.	5.4066899864504565
11826. in medicine the frequencies are much higher transducers and the	sonar beams themselves are much smaller and different scanning techniques	may be used but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.	9.979515625524913
11827. because the body contains so much liquid transmission of	ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.	7.123682064199634
11828. bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic	signals.	8.78135215526032
11829. based on this phenomenon a number of investigators have used	this method to look through human organs.	7.6468237346701855
11830. a good example of	the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers	presented by dr g baum who has explored the human eye.	8.613809975184559
11831. he	can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate	blindness due to glaucoma.	5.8413067907245475
11832. the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically	is illustrated in fig 6.	10.799241060045512
11833. the transducer is coupled to the	body through a water bath not shown.	8.379511569080897
11834. for display dr baum uses	a portion of an f an airborne radar indicator and then photographs	the screen to obtain a permanent record.	8.444679429581168
11835. a typical sonogram	of a human eye together with a description of the anatomical	parts is shown in fig 5.	9.552909443110224
11836. the frequency used for these experiments	is 15 mc and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy	lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter.	8.344709472837108
11837. the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan just like	a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure is moved over a	90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners.	6.568079642763069
11838. the total	picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector	scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.	7.803776135723283
11839. drs	howry	and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied	the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have	obtained extremely good results.	6.678811195028158
11840. by submerging the patient in a tub	and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on they have been	able to get cross-section views of the neck as shown in fig 7 as	well as many other hitherto impossible insights.	9.292372989225951
11841. as mentioned before	bone reflects the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the	spine shows as the black area in the center.	7.773926088289533
11842. arteries and veins are apparent	by their black blood-filled centers and the surrounding white	walls.	6.5298248005906006
11843. a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in	fig 8 with the various parts labeled.	5.797716026120703
11844. oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either	attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a	span of life.	6.557038103487177
11845. he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on	the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august	14 1777.	7.023878551488336
11846. his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender	income made it difficult to feed his family let alone educate	them in a town without even a school.	8.848584398611047
11847. the two older boys hans and anders	his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a	warm	and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german; his wife	taught the two boys to read and write danish.	6.061510728377335
11848. other brothers later joined	them for instruction with oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic	was added to bible reading german and danish in the informal	curriculum.	8.01601271881335
11849. oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the	boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned such as	the pastor to supplement the simple teaching.	4.656283536394988
11850. from the town surveyor	hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student	some academic subjects.	11.01237581858838
11851. the mayor of the town taught them english	and french.	11.201325438931816
11852. whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed	on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the	village.	6.901829061543878
11853. at 12 hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in	the apothecary shop which helped stimulate his interest in medicine	and science.	7.511132019831825
11854. his earlier love for literature and history remained with	him for his entire life.	9.694825866021896
11855. in 1793 the brothers decided to enter	the university of copenhagen and the following	spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the	autumn session.	7.681449959241074
11856. while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine	physics and astronomy his brother studied law.	9.4670963814465
11857. the brothers continued	to help each other during their studies sharing a joint purse	lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of	their aunt.	6.3876329623091115
11858. they supplemented their income by small government assistance	by tutoring and economizing wherever they could.	8.74687237356113
11859. so impressive	were those serious years of study at the university that hans later	wrote to be perfectly free the young man must revel in the great	kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there in which	if he falls it is easy for him to rise again there is freedom	of utterance there which draws after it no irreparable consequences on	society h.	6.480135328376715
11860. i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day	overcame a new difficulty gained a new truth or banished a previous	error.	7.571380961412497
11861. he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing	about science.	7.587548976099465
11862. in this third year at the university hans in 1797	was awarded the first important token of recognition a gold medal for	his essay on limits of poetry and prose.	10.615026253745889
11863. he completed his training	in pharmacy also taking his degree with high honors in 1797	and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with	a prize for an essay in medicine.	6.733596464235689
11864. he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis	which later was accepted in chemical practices.	10.869323167393746
11865. activity	han's student days were at a time when europe	was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america	and in france germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms	and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the	continent.	5.613017917023615
11866. the new century opened with oersted beginning	his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen	and as lecturer at the university.	9.440288396625288
11867. he was stirred by the announcement	of volta's	discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied	the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.	6.541527383846914
11868. the following	year he devoted to the customary wanderjahr traveling in	germany france and the netherlands meeting the philosophers schelling	fichte and tieck.	8.543193629411697
11869. he also met count rumford	who was then serving the elector	of bavaria and the physicist ritter; these were oersted's main	contacts in science.	4.726268483103999
11870. from go^ttingen where he stayed	for 10 days he wrote the first question asked everywhere is	about galvanism.	8.464237018308522
11871. as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass	tubes i have invented i have had quite a small one made here of	four glass	tubes and intend to carry it with me.	7.769506259222104
11872. oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks continuing	their correspondence after he left.	9.645581419166186
11873. with ritter he was exposed	to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's	fertile but disorganized mind.	5.839882629194894
11874. oersted remodeled ritter's notes	into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france	for its annual prize of 3000 francs.	7.485888083424651
11875. the sound discoveries of	this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize	was never awarded to him.	6.730825742205556
11876. in may 1803 ritter in another flight	of fancy wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.	9.303858015525662
11877. he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and	indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided	with the years of important electrical discoveries.	7.331167686798679
11878. thus 1745 corresponded	to the invention of the leiden jar by kleist 1764	that of the electrophorus by wilcke 1782 produced the condenser of	volta and 1801 the voltaic pile.	6.899586720529394
11879. ritter proceeded you now emerge	into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 you will have	to reckon.	7.380823273634756
11880. this we might well witness.	18.40613285882067
11881. ritter died in 1810 and	oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of	it.	7.243825927096874
11882. in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for	the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably	considered more a philosopher than a physicist.	8.232007784468482
11883. however he continued	experimenting and lecturing publishing the results of his experiments	in german and danish periodicals.	8.19866186580649
11884. in 1806 his ambition was	realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university	though not realizing full professorship until 1817.	9.249506875360897
11885. during oersted's attendance at the university it was poorly	equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.	7.38827617546223
11886. he was however fortunate in his contact with prof j g	l manthey teacher of chemistry who in addition to	his academic chair was	also proprietor of the lion pharmacy in	copenhagen where oersted assisted him.	9.27258830049647
11887. manthey maintained a valuable	collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted's	disposal during and after his graduation.	5.21392209110264
11888. in 1800 manthey went	abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy.	12.143833769399558
11889. in	february 1801 oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus	and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates	of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates	of zinc and lead.	6.274245096785407
11890. in the following year 1803 oersted simultaneously	with davy discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic	battery more than did salts.	10.783464631654606
11891. eager as he was to pursue this promising	line he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy	and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university	that he could devote only sunday afternoons to galvanizing.	6.582893684668849
11892. he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and	thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood.	9.98579506283417
11893. the	university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor	represented the upper social level.	7.875454473011764
11894. his broad interest in literary political	and philosophical movements opened many doors to him.	8.789795813048174
11895. his friends	were numerous and their ties to him were strong.	7.380129951842237
11896. the years	1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again but on this	visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his	first journey.	9.808119352786894
11897. in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws	of nature in german and this was issued in french translation	under the title recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques	et electriques a work held in very high esteem by the new	generation	of research chemists.	6.016203911242672
11898. his interest in finding a relationship between	voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated.	10.12024476769733
11899. chapter	8 is entitled on magnetism and in it are included such	remarks as one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces	with the electrical forces.	6.336690788458515
11900. the great resemblance between electrical	and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their	laws necessarily would bring about this comparison.	8.407172936372682
11901. it is true that	nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;	but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those	depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest	difference h.	7.42370198707873
11902. the form of galvanic activity is halfway between	the magnetic form and the electrical form.	12.471303896303677
11903. there forces are more latent	than in electricity and less than in magnetism h.	9.223383745831413
11904. but in such	an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that	the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity	and magnetism were only a difficulty and not a thing which is	contrary to it h.	10.025227801863934
11905. one could also add to these analogies that steel	loses its magnetism by heat which proves that steel becomes a better	conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do.	6.393534812472707
11906. it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature as	proven by bruckmann and coulomb.	12.707245411434043
11907. by that one feels that magnetic	forces are as general as electrical forces.	8.05476158009819
11908. an attempt should be made	to see if electricity in its most latent stage has any action on the	magnet as such.	8.771769213818946
11909. his plan and intent were clearly charted.	8.055183724915963
11910. oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and	political discussions.	10.92760583646342
11911. in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment	as opposed to dogma in another he held that the practice of science	was in fact an act of religious worship.	8.456377985510594
11912. he continued as a popular	lecturer.	16.584095744581248
11913. he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was	caused to glow by an electric current.	7.096128992311543
11914. in 1819 under royal command	he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm	one of the danish islands being one of three scientists in the expedition.	9.134308833007148
11915. it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition	lauritz esmarch that oersted succeeded in producing light	by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric	current was made to flow.	9.448620884854593
11916. together they also developed a new	form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of	copper thereby producing stronger currents.	9.168310427185867
11917. esmarch was among those	who witnessed oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.	5.061190796225391
11918. of electromagnetism	the association between electric	forces and magnetic forces had been	recognized by investigators for many decades.	8.739397215330271
11919. electrical literature	contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and	had altered the polarity of compass needles.	5.769183557985991
11920. in the late 1700's	beccaria and van marum among others had magnetized iron by sending	an electrostatic charge through it.	8.704325549349427
11921. beccaria had almost stumbled on	a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge	from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece	of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic.	5.259723990792755
11922. the resulting magnetic	effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.	10.427899880287322
11923. the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but	no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these	two primary forces.	5.836472435279238
11924. oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive	possibly because he had like other experimenters laid the conducting	wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.	6.800819560276408
11925. the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains	ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the	university related that the first direct event that led to the publication	of oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made	before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820.	7.561229072967619

12026. additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals are	slaughtered.	10.1605824897047
12027. there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle:	fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed	is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;	mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot are filled	by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; special bunks-	as discussed here they permit cattle to eat from all sides.	5.461297432626438
12028. feed is	put in with an elevator.	11.28721596562122
12029. several materials or combinations of	materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk.	7.960119437083184
12030. the selection	of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation	cost of materials available locally and your own preference.	9.192179950143172
12031. no	one material is best for all situations.	9.008060468676494
12032. selecting bunks by economic	comparison is usually an individual problem.	8.563322048008619
12033. animals eat only from one side so the fence-line bunk must be twice	as long as the mechanical bunk.	6.404626615515389
12034. these bunks also serve as a fence	so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence.	11.842594610852451
12035. because	of their location on the edge of the feed lot fence-line bunks are	not in the way of mechanical manure removal.	8.788514502059016
12036. filling these bunks by	the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the	wagons over more time and operations.	6.756562317033306
12037. all-weather roads must	be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all	year.	5.699105308826519
12038. this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.	19.572582266702305
12039. marketing in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties	will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you	have experienced in the last 20-25 yr.	5.3564561293813675
12040. why?	16.542242831953253
12041.  companies of	all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies-	in modern equipment and new processes enlarged r+d	facilities faster new product development.	4.566629249027246
12042. many companies have upgraded	their sales manpower and tested new selling distribution and promotion	techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.	8.465530725067385
12043. given this	kind of business climate what competitive marketing problems will your	company face in the next 10 yr?	7.30270506322272
12044.  based on our experience with	clients we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-	the market place itself marketing methods and marketing management.	7.482154278403638
12045. there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent	years; there is every indication it will continue.	7.333910546035868
12046. frequently wittingly	or unwittingly price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers	distributors and dealers.	6.648107702837295
12047. despite generally good levels of	income we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling	back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.	5.22163335728192
12048. here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy	will be on target:   has the probable price situation in	your field been forecast as a basis for future planning?	8.123397920274705
12049.  have cost	studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might	be done if things get worse?	8.230505742819904
12050.  have you actually checked out	different selling approaches designed to counter	the price competition problem?	10.693126588393058
12051. 	average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding	product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism	of such assertions.	6.2087862615150735
12052. this problem can force a change in marketing approach	in many kinds of businesses.	11.96662379642167
12053. have you examined this problem of	increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?	9.452494876222108
12054. 	need for service is here	to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the	sixties.	8.97061393175648
12055. there are two reasons for this.	28.52005242185339
12056. first most products tend to	become more complex.	11.226779246102659
12057. second in a competitive market the customer	feels his weight and throws it around.	6.504595141456754
12058. providing good customer	service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning	job as the original selling of the product.	7.812908701648974
12059. too often it is	thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.	10.283217390452451
12060. good	service starts with product design and planning: many products seem	to be designed for a production economy not for a service one.	7.6365182941146
12061. proper	follow-through requires training your own sales organization and	your distributor organizations not only in the techniques but also	in good customer relations.	5.897411705722581
12062. have you assessed the importance of	wider discretionary	choices for customers.	13.609913951732484
12063. the consumer is	pulled in many directions.	9.43176643036977
12064. to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type	product- the purchase of which can be switched delayed or	put off entirely- the implications are important.	8.342458537859123
12065. your competition	is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers	in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers	of other appealing consumer products.	5.0611658803950785
12066. many industry trade	associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share	of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.	6.931060665313798
12067. has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary	buying area?	8.81091119293455
12068. 	the trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts	to the southwest and far west and from city to suburbs.	7.8181505918916585
12069. these shifts	will continue in the next 10 yr.	10.179134974858371
12070. have you considered the implications	of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation	strength of distributor organizations and even plant location?	10.83795657856933
12071. 	we	have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions	in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.	4.877991844667578
12072. instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger	sales to or through fewer accounts.	10.998193524628995
12073. the change may require	different products pricing packaging warehousing salesmanship advertising	and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing	network may have to be adjusted.	5.763224743963433
12074. have you examined these trends	forecast the effects and planned your marketing strategy to compete	effectively under changing circumstances?	10.176947869846193
12075. 	methods	in the area	of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of	trends which have been under way during the first decade.	7.104162642469137
12076. as mass dealer	and distributor organizations grow in size there is every reason	to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the	distributor's profits- which is in effect what the sale of private	brands tends to do.	9.57033114975342
12077. average manufacturer frequently has	helped build private brand business delivering largely the same qualities	and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded.	5.7162358035804655
12078. moreover	the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain	stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have	caught on.	7.02057813789969
12079. if you are up against private brand competition	have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening	your market position?	6.590196915807799
12080.  if private brand competition hasn't been	felt in your product field as yet have you thought how you will cope	with it if and when it does appear?	8.932851400618016
12081. 	display merchandising backed by pre-selling through advertising	and promotion will continue to make strides in the sixties.	5.437460724044516
12082. it	has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.	8.703454002140633
12083. how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet	and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are	still important?	5.987875177854528
12084.  if you have a higher-quality product how can you	make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken	word?	7.6360941532309345
12085.  salesmanship is still necessary but it's a different brand	of salesmanship.	3.5703715401598117
12086. have you carefully examined the selling techniques	which best suit your products?	11.289395570015387
12087.  have you studied the caliber	and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements	for effective marketing?	9.231919004035275
12088.  are you experimenting with different selling	higher costs of distribution	some distribution costs are kept up by competitive	pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect	certain niceties and flourishes.	10.651474662525695
12089. no manufacturer has taken the initiative	in pointing out the costs involved.	9.436606976905123

12099. distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties-	and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study	each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.	6.947093611159681
12100. from the manufacturer's	point of view the increasing cost of advertising and promotion	is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties.	10.378949769264446
12101. it is accentuated	by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition.	9.444396280033764
12102. how much fundamental thinking and research has your company	done on its advertising program?	10.423031484538214
12103.  are you following competition willy-nilly-	trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting	with new means for reaching and influencing consumers?	5.3041642759631005

12113. are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd	a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable	estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs; and	translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which	management can act on with some assurance?	5.482254299494628
12114.  we have seen good new	products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts	and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind.	7.063416846501494

12117. while many companies	have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been	product rather than sales training.	7.698174446702562
12118. nor has the training been enough	in relation to the need.	11.497094738274912

12122. men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager	are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications	called for by this type of management work.	9.226644713370652

12135. solutions	frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems	whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing	management.	7.182321305529619
12136. if companies will take the time to give objective	consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke	then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective	marketing in next decade.	9.363955286389173
12137. the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior	designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought	clearly into focus one important difference of opinion.	7.8331732123680125
12138. the architects	do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently	good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect	and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding	the architectural principles involved in planning the interior	of a building.	11.516102118007312
12139. ordinary politeness may have militated against	this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance	in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables workshops	or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject	will recognize that the final boiled down crux of the matter is	education.	5.037796368161243
12140. it is true that most architectural schools have five	year courses some even have six or more.	14.739152610820915
12141. the element of public danger	which enters so largely into architectural certification however	would demand a prolonged study of structure.	6.152712561264769
12142. this would naturally	lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior	designer's training.	10.277187843576156
12143. we may then dismiss the time difference	between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior	design student as not having serious bearing on the subject.	7.638940782374569
12144. the	real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what	is their value as training?	7.390191957188202
12145.    the american institute of interior	designers has published a recommended course for designers and	a percentage layout of such a course.	7.248029944239307
12146. an examination of some forty	catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design for the most	part schools accredited by membership in the national association of	schools of art and a further on the spot inspection of a number	of schools show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.	8.54489173152873
12147. one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but	the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to	the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.	8.46377017744038
12148. the suggested course of the aid was based	on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to	curricular necessities.	10.98990114746959
12149. obviously the four year provision limits this	to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.	7.518942038689276
12150. without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture	versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs	of the interior designer.	6.9074847109579105
12151. to begin with what is an interior	designer?	14.392584618144037
12152.  the dictionary of occupational titles published	by the u s department of labor describes him as follows: designs	plans and furnishes interiors of houses commercial and institutional	structures hotels clubs ships theaters as well as set	decorations for motion picture arts and television.	8.472450940629164
12153. makes drawings and	plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor coverings wall	decorations and determines color schemes.	5.618044870800687
12154. furnishes complete	cost estimates for clients approval.	9.205274463409701
12155. makes necessary purchases places	contracts supervises construction installation finishing and placement	of furniture fixtures and other correlated furnishings and follows	through to completion of project.	5.308327108619217
12156. in addition to this	the u s civil service bureau when examining applicants for	government positions as interior designers expects that when various	needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.	10.421318285377279
12157. he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture	of any craft materials needed in the furnishings.	7.650323283698602
12158. this	seems like a large order.	11.043443211781412
12159. the interior designer then must first be	an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and	plumbing and finance.	6.867453088383338
12160. yet nobody will question the necessity of all this	and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice	it.	10.134266537880112
12161. and further he must understand his obligation to the client	to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve	his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.	6.463115950620988
12162. few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording	of their curriculum.	11.581501557194368
12163. it is in the quality of the teaching of all this	that a question may arise.	16.721566133218378
12164. the old established independent art	schools try their best to fulfill their obligations.	10.191800936320595
12165. yet even here	many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with	a floor plan and the simple command- design a luxury apartment;	no description of the client or his cultural level no assertion of	geographical area or local social necessities- simply a luxury	apartment.	4.574946552515723
12166. working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only	in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may	please the public relations department but have little to do with the	essence of interior design.	8.73981576782261
12167. it is possible of course to work	on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will	explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel	of real interior design demands.	8.034596357458993
12168. unfortunately the purely synthetic	problem is the rule.	12.263593935464643
12169. it is like medical schools in india where	in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead	bodies is frowned upon.	7.059071531221295
12170. instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs	of plants.	12.633911216538483
12171. thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense	of actual experience.	7.929846792784469
12172. in the earlier years of training certain	phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its	use.	12.778183922288687
12173. but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.	11.34334186869966
12174. consultation with architects clients real estate men	fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development	of class problems just as in actual work.	8.80630385697789
12175. fortunately although	only a few years ago they held the student at arms length today	the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only	from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from	the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of	tomorrow- that the student already is in the trade.	7.892998864252301
12176. even	the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from	photographs and lantern slides.	9.114493068242966
12177. here too the reality of actual furniture	must be experienced.	10.428853607729598
12178. the professional organizations such	as american institute of interior designers national society	of interior designers home fashions league and various trade associations	can and do aid greatly in this work.	8.63366617154919
12179. certainly every educator	involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework	of one of these organizations.	9.091258969955756
12180. not only should every educator	above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of	the professional organizations but his first qualification for membership	as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership	would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.	9.90536204654837
12181. participation for the educator in this case however would have to	be raised to full and complete membership.	7.031059543732709
12182. the largest of these organizations	at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the	conduct and standards of the group and indeed refuses him even the	right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.	10.025960490141882
12183. this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower	his standing in the eyes of the students.	9.329254447903727
12184. the professor in turn	dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in	the policies and standards of which he has no voice.	11.494460129683917
12185. this seems	somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications	for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced the	educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.	5.993509159886125
12186. in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to	the schools.	13.06178218740486
12187. that is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses	in their membership requirements.	11.669144566591243
12188. when these groups were	first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have	had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were	rare and	undeveloped during their youth.	8.62476465386793
12189. long hard years of on the	job training had brought them to their competence.	8.004873932803232
12190. the necessity	of that day has long disappeared.	12.79349820733015
12191. there is plenty of opportunity	for proper education today.	16.295514434101385
12192. it is discouraging for students to realize	that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they	are supposed to stand.	12.016682029446603
12193. the reason and the day of grandfather	clauses has long since passed.	11.353010296697317
12194. no one can deny that these back	door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused	nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents	to membership in supposedly learned societies.	10.078149229063294
12195. beyond	any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality	of the teachers themselves.	6.531766509813091
12196. it will occur to anyone that the teacher	must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far	beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication	to his subject and to his students.	9.709408933744934
12197. the local decorator who rushes	in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these	qualifications.	9.159515307524883
12198. nor will the hack the jack-of-all-trades still	found in some of the smaller art schools suffice.	8.727459017347417
12199. only a	few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher	of interior design.	8.1577858961479
12200. at the end of its letter was the information	that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume	design and advertising art.	12.334890822848942
12201. this kind of irresponsibility toward	their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude	in the future designer.	6.956042448112224
12202. we must build a corp of highly professional	teachers of interior design who have had education experience	in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments	of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.	9.112374336237318
12203. considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture	furniture design textiles and color is also desirable.	6.042689848280478
12204. in all degree courses in interior design a number of academic	or general studies courses are included.	12.594195761069026
12205. it is only fair	to demand that teachers of courses in english history psychology	and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior	design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.	8.200226921587069
12206. the	proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only	if this standard is observed.	9.508083407190446
12207. the matter of sympathy of the academic	professors for art objectives also must be taken into account.	10.514666006024802
12208. one technical question of school organization comes to mind here.	12.885910603608215
12209. for	proper accreditation of schools teachers in any course must have	a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.	7.202272199013012
12210. since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate	work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed.	11.547712931169063
12211. indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable	schools of art have granted degrees at all.	9.248355649196982
12212. the question however	cannot be ignored for long.	12.561366504564722
12213. the basic problem involved is that a college	setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty	for the advanced degree.	7.135029793133704
12214. most professors in the course must naturally	again have a higher degree than the course offers.	12.14272206418838
12215. one solution	is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute.	9.456845918785723
12216. it is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.	14.002329478614568
12217. this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.	10.797729912321085
12218. only the independent art schools that is those not connected	with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation	before accreditation by the various regional organizations.	8.134275241098212
12219. it has	been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation	for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of	their fine arts department.	7.226919536554108
12220. this plus the habit of many schools of	simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics	department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior	design has contributed to the low repute of many university courses	in interior design.	8.516243660530474
12221. in spite of this many universities offer adequate	and even distinguished courses in the subject.	9.136848579208378
12222. there will be	no mitigation of these offences until all art schools whether independent	or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do	medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the national	association of schools of art.	8.324037772577565
12223. independent art schools	granting degrees must naturally follow this with academic accreditation	by the appropriate regional group.	6.066046128473443
12224. how long has it been since you reviewed the objectives	of your benefit and service program?	9.32858378936207
12225.  have you permitted it to become	a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee	morale and consequently increased productivity?	8.783830185446543
12226.    what	effort do you make to assess results of your program?	11.790272998318978
12227.  do you measure	its relation to reduced absenteeism turnover accidents and grievances	and to improved quality and output?	7.300287766165555
12228.    have you set specific	objectives for your employee publication?	15.262647787514808
12229.  is it reaching these	goals?	16.40801580078236

12231.  are you using	the most economical printing methods paper etc.	8.773990949066757
12232. are there other	cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted?	14.940951328096855
12233. 	has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess	of free government work in your plant?	5.719135633744526
12234.    is your purchasing	agent offering too much free-buying service for employees?	8.738976712059133
12235. 	when improvements are recommended in working conditions- such as	lighting rest rooms eating facilities air-conditioning- do you try	to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity?	4.657658170225563
12236.    when	negotiating with your union do you make sure employees have a choice	between new benefits and their cents-per-hour cost in wages.	7.436301165552078
12237. can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those	paid for by profit-sharing money such as was done in the union contract	recently signed by american motors corporation?	6.4271644283883145
12238. 	do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance	entitles them?	8.323516315330641
12239.  are they encouraged to take full legal advantage	of these benefits?	9.230511337515148
12240.  have you publicized the cents-per-hour value	of the company's share of insurance premiums?	6.697456463765548

12335. workers usually think	more of a plan they contribute to.	6.8744848706678034

12354. this will cut the expense of vacation replacements.	15.341481887956528
12355. and with	the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice	vacation dates.	8.248353888372883
12356. also make sure you have reasonable requirements	as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a	vacation.	11.22541972189553

12362. as the generations move on clothes	become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports.	11.929452978983942
12363. sporting	firearms change markedly for the better.	7.519669258496294
12364. just as modern transportation	has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon the demand of	today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.	7.7428900376623355
12365. the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through	diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle	loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders	extremely accurate bolt lever and slide action firearms.	4.86537681235283
12366. and	millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition	designed for today's hunting and target shooting.	5.308601822124811
12367. and due	to modern resource-use and game management practices there is still	game to shoot even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and	water.	5.179794862871464
12368. present conservation practices regard wildlife not as an expendable	natural resource but as an annual harvest to be sown and also	reaped.	8.033017579940488
12369. unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states	on shooting preserves	for five and six months each year.	6.246617964434038
12370. close to two million	game birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting	preserves and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas	during the 1960-61 season.	7.082420765722398
12371. the shooting development program of the	sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers' institute has successfully	published these facts in all major outdoor magazines many national	weeklies and the trade papers.	6.1006137330600145
12372. the most effective way to	develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly	managed shooting preserves.	9.609403770902002
12373. this has been the aim of the director	of the shooting development program the new york staff of the sportsmen's	service bureau and the saami shooting preserve	field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.	9.147271823690406
12374. following	the kick-off of saami's shooting development program	in 1954 a most interesting meeting took place in washington d c.	7.153609761992818
12375. the group known as the american association for health physical	education and recreation	initiated a conference which brought together representatives	of the national rifle association saami and the american	fishing tackle manufacturers.	7.128251439531248
12376. this meeting was called to	determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as	the outdoor education project.	10.099396373904668
12377. the outdoor education project	took cognizance of the fact so often overlooked that athletic	activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship	to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life.	7.007281272225641
12378. the	various team sports assuredly have their place in every school and	they are important to proper physical development.	8.192481886576605
12379. but with the exception	of professional athletes few contact sports and physical education	activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of	the average american man or woman.	7.012974683084888
12380. following a vigorous campaign	of interpretation and leadership development by oep director	dr julian smith today thousands of secondary schools colleges	and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical	education and recreation programs.	7.536222247570477

12390. saami's	field men have served as consultants andor have participated in	75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic	young americans.	7.248727504540601

12392. the	continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will	assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made	aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities	for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand.	8.490113446805386
12393. while individual	sportsmen are aware of this situation too many of our political	social educational and even religious leaders too often forget it.	7.535167703689654

12406. there were	umbrella tents wall tents cottage tents station wagon tents pup	tents pop tents baker tents tents with exterior frames camper trailers	travel trailers and even a few surplus parachutes serving as	sunshades over entire family camps.	7.422265354171136
12407. moving around camp we saw	all kinds of camp stoves lanterns coolers bedding games fishing tackle	windbreaks and sunshades.	5.540845745610458
12408. we saw similar displays in the other	three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long national seashore recreation	area.	7.877175428506673
12409. dealers would do well to visit such a campground often look	at the equipment and talk with the campers.	7.78000514974266
12410. here you begin to appreciate	the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.	10.176699552414696
12411. camping is big and getting bigger.	9.027881552808687
12412. no one knows where it will	stop.	16.97657901323275
12413. almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement	of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of	all outdoor markets.	6.7868012426752236
12414. you read various guesses on how many americans	are camping.	12.214788829201114
12415. the number depends on who is talking at the moment.	11.121362069212003
12416. the	figures range as high as 15 million families.	11.46786620444141
12417. i've heard 10 million	mentioned often but i'm more inclined to think there may be a	total of some five to seven million families camping.	4.065153376366165
12418. seven million families	would total 30 million americans or more.	9.849975683799672
12419. consider the equipment	needed to protect this many from the weather to make their cooking	easy and their sleeping comfortable.	6.778902864860731
12420. harassed state park officials often have more campers than they	know what to do with.	9.754009037129425
12421. they are struggling to meet the demand for camping	space but families are being turned away especially on holiday	weekends.	8.33318064938152
12422. the national parks always popular camping places are facing	the same pressure.	10.482077374194652
12423. the national park service hopes by 1966 to	have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day- almost	twice what there are at present.	5.914259014069646
12424. the u s forest service cares	for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests	and is increasing its facilities steadily.	12.006320044085095
12425. but the campers still	come.	16.345779854677374
12426. they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding.	11.948553170424224
12427. they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.	8.714957499912607
12428. they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing	numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation	that becomes a family experience of lasting importance.	9.94607897414747
12429. keep coming	there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for	the migration to the campgrounds.	9.677785470294065
12430. among them according to the u	s department of commerce are:	higher pay	earlier retirement and more education.	10.734870162504278
12431. the more people learn about	their country the more they want to learn.	9.363961002706773
12432. camping is family fun	and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever	saw before.	12.176094645291766
12433. but make no mistake about it the first reason	people turn to camping is one of economy.	10.420116643497375
12434. here is the promise of a vacation	trip they can afford.	16.111896277698154
12435. the american automobile association	computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile comes	up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29.	7.414674006956221
12436. the aaa	then splits it down this way: $10.	9.910414215429771
12437. 50 for lodging	$7 for gas and oil and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.	4.9509983382248715
12438. what does	the camping couple do to this set of figures?	11.61044112551083
12439.  the $9.	14.786723175924251
12440. 50 for lodging	they save.	15.618087309195186
12441. because they prepare their own meals they also keep in	their pockets a good portion of that $10.	7.824334819555988
12442. 50 food bill along with most	of the tip money.	11.060473472800762
12443. the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing	cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping	along the way.	4.887960049017313
12444. where americans used to think of a single	vacation each summer they now think about how many vacations they	can have.	10.242827883626639
12445. long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or	four days several times a year.	9.529926548989504
12446. and even if they stay in resorts part	of the time they might if the right salesman gets them in tow develop	a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip	into the wide open spaces.	9.045784377946303
12447. it would be a mistake to sell those	thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts	of home.	8.03155832705913
12448. home is the place to find the comforts of	home.	18.50697584409379
12449. they're buying fun and adventure and family experiences.	3.8453541389387773
12450. but	it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable	camping has become.	10.900592829004854
12451. this is no longer a way of life for the bearded	logger and the wandering cowboy.	13.343868567560998
12452. today's campers want comforts and	they have them.	4.6612124879364
12453. and this helps explain why so many people are now going	camping.	10.500996565176843
12454. it's fun and it's easy- so easy that there is time	left after cooking and tent keeping for the women to get out and	enjoy outdoor fun with their families.	5.231636276952199
12455. camp meals are no great	problem.	7.811116230663009
12456. neither are beds thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags.	10.31982562179261
12457. neither are shelters because there is one to meet the needs of every	camper or prospective camper.	11.336779454277428
12458. but there is still the sometimes	complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for	their individual needs.	15.107539020286685
12459. throughout history the man who showed superior performance has become	the commander of others- for good or bad.	6.127654211361584
12460. since the industrial	revolution when factories emerged this classical pattern has been	followed.	10.030207699349479
12461. there have always been tales	of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator	willingly or not and found he didn't like it; the scientist	who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more	commonly in recent years the engineer who found that other duties interfered	with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions.	4.544335817123311
12462. there	have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into	very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work to their own and	the public's dissatisfaction and loss.	7.396875005838441
12463. this has been more	evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased	technology.	8.943931077534474
12464. the remedies have been many and varied- attempts to	teach management techniques- either in plant at special schools	or	in university crash courses- provision of management-trained assistants	or associates.	5.178262219985339
12465. but the realization has been growing that	these are not the complete answer.	11.04148706236178
12466. some men have no talent for or	interest in management; forcing them into management can only create	trouble.	7.621867668434138
12467. the old shop adage still holds: a good mechanic is usually	a bad boss.	5.871687460608057
12468. yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition	of managerial status as the gage of success.	8.349548176480653
12469. labor fights to	change its collar from blue to white.	6.719294516490701
12470. all grades of management seek	more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures.	9.277090119589767
12471. as several	recent books have over-emphasized we have become the most status-conscious	nation in the world.	5.455825777551842
12472. what can be done for	the individual contributor who is extremely important- and	likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented	company?	10.30938141932452
12473.  he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and	outside; usually concerned about america's belief that attainment	and success are measured in dollars and titles.	6.067578829785622
12474. yet titles are traditionally	given only to management men and income tends to rise with	title.	10.005483289465932
12475. even the college professor in america has been affected.	10.523891067608071
12476. it is as one engineer says indeed a difficult thing for the	engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he	could employing managerial skills.	12.633289189873222
12477. this difficulty arises even though	we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course.	8.089849103229838
12478. this	leads one to conclude as you have that there is inevitably more	prestige in a management position in the minds of our people.	12.534815637791665
12479. nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than	engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers.	7.265104238692766
12480. so we asked such	men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on	the dual-road-up problem- and more importantly- their solutions.	7.188647431770443
12481. in the paragraphs that follow we quote from 32 men who are identified	on the final page.	8.220621554496256
12482. among	the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of	general electric.	7.36261170736947
12483. this is not a mutually exclusive plan; there	is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the	technical or the managerial path upward.	5.980612885866426
12484. further the management path	does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by	the more technical path.	9.389994404602618
12485. it is common to shift back and forth working	up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.	9.344224208064315
12486. actually there are a number of individual-contributor	positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services	operation that are filled by men with successful managerial	experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.	7.596118014228615
12487. also	moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's	recognition as a technical expert.	5.393226730606275
12488. as examples at ge: glen	b warren formerly manager of the turbine division widely recognized	as a turbine designer.	8.006016049488577
12489. the late w r g baker a pioneer	in television design and long-time vp + gm of the electronics	division and later by his own choice an individual consultant.	4.817018275786982
12490. harold e strang expert in switchgear design for a long period	vp + gm of the measurements + industrial products division	and who currently approaching retirement is vice-president and consulting	engineer in the switchgear + control division.	4.55963194687088
12491. in	the ge plan a number of individual contributors have positions	and compensation higher than those of many managers.	7.776306778813302
12492. these positions	carry such titles as:   consultant- advanced development	consulting engineer   consulting engineer- heat transfer	consulting electrical engineer   senior electrical	engineer   senior physicist   westinghouse has a similar	system with two classifications representing various levels of competence	on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist	as the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist.	5.335572898384573
12493. many	companies have systems particularly in r + d which work more	or less well depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on	the part of administration as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent	quotations.	5.239352845662062
12494. another factor that may hold hope is for parallel	recognition is as one man says it: h that the fad for educating	top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically	trained approach.	7.351555960612643
12495. one company instituted	early in 1959 a vertical classification system consisting of four	levels.	7.8499874519408515
12496. there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;	the top non-supervisory level senior staff engineer enjoys status	and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.	9.856485647068414
12497. the second level senior engineer rates slightly below first-level	supervision.	9.140542504397173
12498. the expectation is that first-level supervisors will	be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third	engineering level with very few coming from the first level.	8.84673842249756
12499. the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for	non-supervisory engineers but probably not into executive levels.	6.077298077602437
12500. in this organization about half of the engineers with 15 or more	years of employment are in supervision engineering or elsewhere.	11.93734940910435
12501. this	reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which	are not military.	5.298053958160235
12502. several other examples:	we have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering	department headed by a chief engineer.	6.899379805770196
12503. we have set up a central r	+ d department as well as engineering-management departments-	about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.	6.6794394849157905
12504. a separate research department is of course confined to new or future	designs.	11.453761976685506
12505. part of this headquarters staff however are engineering	managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters	management.	10.088909028408299
12506. these headquarters engineers headed by the vice-president-	engineering counsel and advise divisional managers and chief	engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are	engineers who have been advanced from the divisions.	7.184972343088328
12507. these men are	considered managers of engineers.	10.770571667226816
12508. they must learn to wear several hats	so to speak working with management sales and engineering problems	related to the product.	9.577551500697373
12509. we do not have people in our organization	termed 'consultants' or 'fellows' who are specialists	in one particular technical subject.	6.629628192063641
12510. i suppose it is because we are	just not big enough.	14.369869955585425
12511. we have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers	retained and called in on certain problems.	8.286580060985546
12512. the only 'fellows'	in our company are those who have been honored by asme aiee	or aiche h i am sure that the engineer who enters	management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities	than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider	accountability.	9.686485423218059
12513. we have tried to make both	paths attractive so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction	in either.	8.733128718561575
12514. one way to formalize this is in the job structure.	18.398785729297785
12515. we have these positions which compare directly: f   above	these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president	of engrg r + d.	5.064960595219154
12516. the latter jobs include major management	responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily	through the engineering-management side h we have not yet	succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable	to our higher levels of management but i believe we will trend	top	job: research scientist we	initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons h the	highest position is known as a 'research scientist'.	7.99900171689099
12517. this approach	has not been entirely satisfactory.	9.665090275754633
12518. the primary deterrent appears to	lie with the technical people themselves and their concept of what	constitutes status in present-day society.	8.508413679635478
12519. scientists who agitate	hardest	for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept	it h we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private	offices and private secretaries are extremely important; and although	we have attempted to provide these status symbols support of the	'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted h despite the creation	of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that	of men in top managerial positions.	4.98236690316562
12520. a serious problem	accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly	defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.	8.374778960594426
12521. with no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the	next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless	of performance h promotion is too often based on longevity and	time in salary grade instead of merit.	6.850927131248887
12522. if no specific organization	plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level	the result is a department top-heavy with high-level high-salaried personnel.	7.916495938007487
12523. we have two approaches	for the technical man: the position of staff engineer which	is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative	organization to take the routine load away from department managers	and project engineers as much as possible thus allowing them more time	for strictly technical work.	6.1889726061748735
12524. these are only halfway measures and	the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man	in industry h to progress without limit in salary and prestige.	8.999568575213305
12525. we have made limited application of the 'parallel	ladder' plan.	9.877109374355475
12526. the highest rated non-supervisory engineering	title is 'research engineer'.	7.602688370876404
12527. the salary schedule permits remuneration	greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering	supervision.	10.52797557506847
12528. we also have an 'engineering	section head- research engineer' classification which has salary	possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer.	7.976497978345558
12529. above this	point there is no generally used parallel ladder.	8.968720070859082
12530. we also	do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a	'professional'	and also to give public recognition to individual technical	competence.	9.107059210128442
12531. these include encouragement of and assistance	to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.	7.828521875824367
12532. we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity a magazine	widely distributed both within and without the company and an	information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes	of all engineers.	8.59183531106542
12533. publicity is given to the award of patents to	our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership	in technical societies.	6.8085678689086455
12534. a recent and more pertinent action	has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the	vice-president for engineering.	9.566347277874042
12535. this function is staffed by engineers	chosen for their technical competence and who have the title member	of the technical staff'.	7.367535796612115
12536. salaries compare favorably with those paid	to the first two or three levels of management.	10.456865505415426
12537. additional symbols	of status are granted such as reserved parking distinctive badge passes	authorizing special privileges and a difference in the treatment	of financial progress through merit.	5.756088977785982
12538. we presently are involved	in inaugurating a new development center.	11.753769782362811
12539. operations of this nature	offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.	6.800721624202842
12540. all scientific	staff members will have the title 'research-staff member'.	11.939020119351923
12541. the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the	scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific	field.	6.722845359868901
12542. contrary to usual organization-position evaluations	the position to which research-staff members report administratively will	not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member	therefore are not necessarily evaluated as highly.	6.1064327122400925
12543. these	recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number	of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence.	6.864937399642498
12544. it	is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result	entirely from company efforts.	7.669342168769806
12545. fundamental to the difficulty of creating	the desired prestige is the fact that in the business community	prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that	one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in	the management functions.	7.88014390986978
12546. sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills	of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there	is a new home development called oakwood heights.	12.03452030647113
12547. as a matter	of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated	county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages	in the $14000 range.	7.576802448573394
12548. but oakwood heights is unique in one particular	h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line	that starts at a central storage point.	9.662569294993693
12549. this is a pilot operation	sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state	pipeline corporation with principal offices in new york state.	7.270151422852167
12550. its president is otis m waters partner in the law firm of timen	+ waters 5404 chrysler bldg new york city.	7.568880792367523
12551. vice-president	is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter.	4.016884310266129
12552. ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft	distributors inc newburgh ny.	7.975185770174681
12553. the idea	of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty.	8.691192123009285
12554. not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u s	and canada even overseas write to fueloil + oil heat to inquire	if it's feasible and where it is being done.	7.906470802457898
12555. its editors only	knew of one example to point to a public housing development of 278	homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march 1950 issue.	7.081303399862392
12556. this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern	among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.	14.500856717163364
12557. rather	the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis	of number of rooms and persons in the family.	6.4635849071156155
12558. common complaints	included mrs murphy leaving her windows open all the time	a fresh air fan or the family was visiting aunt minnie with	the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil.	7.582171567506215
12559. as a	result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central	distribution.	10.095635279767677
12560. a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks	the situation at oakwood heights.	10.3541827956133
12561. called a slo-flo meter	it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles	a key individual being don nelson.	6.491384185421878
12562. tri-state has acquired	its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states.	6.3453676111536845
12563. there's an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed	by a lawyer.	3.3306587951045787
12564. the earlier new haven development was public housing	so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture.	9.625721104447814
12565. these	have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and	a host of others.	6.683684833601057
12566. in working out the practical legal conclusions president	waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is	planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments	nationally.	8.979082414153831
12567. it is always difficult or at least time-consuming	to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one	example.	9.914253988069056
12568. to overcome this the builder lays and completes the street	himself then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual	easement for the oil lines.	8.851301883840973
12569. when a family buys a home the title is subject	to a perpetual easement to tri-state.	7.602960977488615
12570. for the central storage	tri-state buys one acre buries its tanks and simply holds permanent	title to that piece.	8.1324075047748
12571. in other words the whole storage and pipeline	system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather	to tri-state.	9.2594269642601
12572. how does tri-state get its revenue from this	plan?	8.891331915464592
12573.  it leases the whole facility to a large oil company at least	large enough to have a strong credit position.	8.81518778731868
12574. this first test is	being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least	15 years.	9.870343567180742
12575. the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use	of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all	the homes is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable	to both parties.	7.093304539120254
12576. on this first venture the central storage is	20000 gallons in two tanks or an average of 400 gallons for each of	the 50 homes.	9.76185107980987
12577. the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport	loads so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather	contingencies.	5.894951437208405
12578. however that is not all he has to do.	21.386642611285158
12579. he must	undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine	heating.	8.145139306181715
12580. in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water	form paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot	water hookups.	7.985410304331492
12581. again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals	as he finds best.	7.687492920629888
12582. for this first development the supplier	signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being	transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor.	9.819983293428258
12583. the major	gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor	apparently can do well because delivery cost is low.	7.756234857379175
12584. considerations	the officers of the new corporation have naturally	explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected.	10.586203775985437
12585. for example the officials of poughkeepsie town where the	project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow	clearing problem.	7.865163841836312
12586. the central storage is near a main artery quite	easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing with fewer	trucks in the residential streets.	8.567916977261143
12587. the public service commission	has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to	their	many regulations.	11.866079249531143
12588. several financial institutions both banks	and insurance companies have been sounded out.	8.704993423147272
12589. they like it and would	supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong	oil companies.	10.673134310401034
12590. the government housing agencies consider it	feasible with one special stipulation.	11.216897451417578
12591. there must be a restriction in	the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the	current market price for the oil h an obvious precaution since the	account is permanently wedded just like with gas or electricity.	7.583298146046818
12592. for a few details of the system h the lines are 1-14''	x-tru-coat a product of republic steel corp and all lines	are welded.	10.09590859568924
12593. they are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some	areas four feet down particularly under roads to stay clear of all	other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy	trucking.	6.172438018411701
12594. the meter is mounted high on the basement wall.	13.207523583448769
12595. its figures	are a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallons.	7.384126586918192
12596. it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.	14.68339105580454
12597. ritter the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the	heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than	would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.	7.079214384065805
12598. he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder	developments where gas is available.	13.032220579928794
12599. it would be pretty	difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods and that's	an understatement.	7.415703723093469
12600. the job of getting property easements and street	easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.	9.606265922703507
12601. but in a new development where everything starts from scratch	the solutions are simple.	10.093821007083376
12602. what does tri-state actually	want to do now that it has the meters under franchise and certain	phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage?	9.879426430517414
12603. 	it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including	its facility in their new home projects by financing and installing	the storage piping and meters and leasing these for 15 years	with renewal options to a strong oil company.	5.504076461750446
12604. it may also work in one	other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters	letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.	9.82239257321563
12605. this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers	for the idea has so often been mentioned somewhat wistfully.	9.676446575886992
12606. but it's too early yet to go visit oakwood heights.	6.420814884059447
12607. only eight of	the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on	june 8th; others were building.	6.639176769921249
12608. the big tanks were at the site but	still sunning themselves.	13.366790416459477
12609. a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches	and the town building inspector was paying a friendly if curious	visit.	6.54736317289116
12610. the oilheating industry is looking up led by a revival	of research and development.	10.123395873145927
12611. a primary ingredient in these fields	is imagination and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a	very good mark.	5.333622595967221
12612. every year about this time national gargle your cooling	system week rolls around.	9.106841525281288
12613. it pays in the long run to take good	care of the water works.	12.297198963449738
12614. do it this way for the summer gargle:	first drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.	11.592250323500325
12615. don't	save the anti-freeze even if it the expensive permanent type.	5.358966036084987
12616. the word means it won't boil away easily nothing else.	7.278995879689204
12617. the rust	inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year and you don't want	to risk the rust that two years' use could mean.	4.1002764678697865
12618. if a lot of rust shows in the drain use a good flushing cleaner.	13.041599854398676
12619. then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor.	10.100586773427077
12620. of	course you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.	7.6439376468
12621. now check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections	around the freeze-out plugs gaskets water pump seals and heater	fittings.	5.061968329235217
12622. next run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat	opens and then look for leaks again.	10.123090898291867
12623. be sure the bugs and	dirt are blown out of the radiator fins.	10.829268203351274
12624. use the air hose for this job.	13.734195224147777
12625. check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.	11.020425314440788
12626. if you	use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as dowguard	be sure to check it.	9.686243536812931
12627. dow says that the fluid can be used now	for two years.	8.65088518755699
12628. check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in	during the summer.	9.482979731349971
12629. take precautions now to be sure you avoid	those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms	this summer.	7.332195101705927
12630. pull the thermostats	out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours.	7.948946337513136
12631. spring and summer may be here officially but those thermos stay	in.	7.274034778049824
12632. the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from	any water cooled vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption	reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation	of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.	9.701462121038466
12633. if you	run into excess plug fouling on one truck check to be sure that the rig	has a thermostat.	8.858123478147219
12634. the thermostat is important to get your engine up	to operating temperature quickly and to keep it running at its most	efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.	9.408216603866114
12635. for your truck insurance?	11.66736774986382
12636.  there's	a good chance you are doubling on some coverage not taking discounts	coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.	7.794342648015596
12637. have a talk with your insurance agent.	14.32448052918018
12638. be careful that you keep	adequate coverage but look for places to save money.	12.507403066861524
12639. first go over the	type of coverage you now have.	8.127361679507151
12640. look for these features which may mean	you can save:    duplicate coverage.	10.174913449362426
12641. avoid doubling up	on the same item.	7.766097543110941
12642. for example don't pay in a truck policy for medical	coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.	9.444558236396812
12643. does your policy have a lay-up clause?	9.482374017641755
12644.  this means that	if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days insurance	can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to	you.	9.97639599655491
12645. this applies to repair work or winter storage.	10.648455522912304
12646. the figure	five is important in insurance.	14.755659256437132
12647. with many company policies you get	a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs.	7.158252181469325
12648. this means either cars	or trucks.	17.053799143643072
12649. discounts run up to 2% of cost.	6.15090450611818
12650. usually premium	reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability	plan.	11.143470615901956
12651. for example: if your bodily injury claims start payment after	the first $250 a 25% premium saving is often made.	3.4761074872808737
12652. n the period since the end of world war 2- a period	coinciding	with merchandising demands for the colorful the unusual and the original	in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that	today	they are the acknowledged leaders in the field.	7.868910547638667
12653. the importance of the	sign industry to the plastics industry however is not in terms of	volume alone.	9.23320487072834
12654. designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing	approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings	of other industries.	9.346484147282567
12655. many of today's developments in thermoforming	stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of	preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers;	and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons	medallions etc owes much to the field as does the technology	of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent	plastics.	4.797356165629083
12656. there is much that many industries can continue to	learn from some of the more recent developments described below.	17.023275774085196
12657. the	concept of trans-illumination as just	one example offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-	no matter what industry is involved.	5.058908345388306
12658. according	to a recent wall street journal survey plastics units now	account for more than 50% of all sign sales.	7.731707035248012
12659. five years ago they had	only 10% of the market with the remainder firmly entrenched in the	stronghold of neon tubing.	7.5729967714957995
12660. and it's far from the end for plastics.	7.23521588932909
12661. industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during	the 1960's will be of plastic construction.	4.787497339304668
12662. evidence of this	trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies	in the field as advance neon sign co los angeles calif.	10.062827286125788
12663. four years ago the company's entire line was devoted to neon	signs; today 85% is in plastics.	5.020689478004354
12664. from the volume standpoint	the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive.	12.614891727881517
12665. aggregate	sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million.	5.590483906324754
12666. currently	there are some 6000 companies in the field ranging from small firms	with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities	for production of metal electrical and plastic components.	8.230931058035054
12667. the trend to plastics?	12.352344394020207
12668. 	what accounts for the rapid growth	of plastics in the sign and display field?	9.747699714950658
12669.  out of many factors which	might be cited five are most important:  plastics combine	such properties as built-in color light weight optional transparency	or translucency resistance to corrosion as well as the ease of fabrication.	6.0647932867252745
12670. according to one	major producer materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately	25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit.	7.97637494499045
12671. shipping cost is	also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft plastic sign weighs about 120 lb	compared to 275-300 lb for neon.	3.3459746084710273
12672. the weight advantage plus greater	durability of the plastic unit yields a saving of about one-fifth	in shipping.	8.582699528964337
12673. the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings	are needed.	7.123510973130028
12674. finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are	much lower than on fragile neon signs.	8.606068115672564
12675. they offer exceptional	design freedom making it	possible to incorporate contours and details	which give free range to the talents of the designer.	6.3707382555883925
12676. vacuum- and pressure-formed	sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded	plastics.	6.53496270585516
12677. pre-decoration	low-cost molds and the freedom to form large	and small thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the	industry.	5.282537403521774
12678. plastics signs work around the clock.	11.955272457117745
12679. internal	illumination protected from the elements gives them powerful visual	appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command	attention and interest.	4.874452105274493
12680. advances in equipment and fabrication	techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide	choice of production techniques ranging from injection molding for	intricate smaller-size mass-production signs	to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited	runs.	7.176430915517101
12681. among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field	what plastics	to use?	8.872947100430407
12682.  with its outstanding	optical characteristics weather resistance and formability strongly	dominates the picture.	9.787082035963401
12683. at present both the familiar cast acrylic	and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers	with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total.	5.816838677173286
12684. of interest is a recent	announcement by du pont's	polychemicals dept of a new methyl methacrylate	monomer designated as monocite h 100 which was developed	specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and	lighting industry.	7.629742650992234
12685. sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs	only one-third as much as glass is impervious to all kinds of weather	and will not yellow.	5.415872344727308
12686. its high impact strength even at low temperatures	resists chipping cracking and crazing according to du pont.	8.15074397586836
12687. cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed	signs background panels and molded or formed letters because of its	exceptional toughness ease of forming and excellent weathering properties.	5.028353591105678
12688. its clarity and good optical properties are other important	factors.	10.455203706834052
12689. new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which	the two sheets of the laminate are of different color.	7.609080634634158
12690. thermoforming	the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical	way to produce a two-color sign.	7.905749979427363
12691. for specialized types of displays such as large three-dimensional	units reproducing a product package human or animal figures	etc reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols	are other materials frequently used.	5.001671100110037
12692. a relative newcomer	in	outdoor signs is mylar polyester film now used as a printed overlay	for trans-illuminated signs.	9.479000164408411
12693. for outdoor signs and	displays where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a	factor the choice of plastics is almost unlimited.	7.815481974308874
12694. here may be found	regular and impact styrene cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate and	cellulose propionate acrylic vinyl expandable styrene foam and polyethylene.	7.6171974029814535
12695. the final choice of material depends upon such factors as	costs method of fabrication degree of complexity number of units	required time available for tooling and projected life expectancy of	the unit.	6.095417464626768
12696. often the finished sign or display incorporates several types	of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.	9.532187904602011
12697. billboards	one of the most significant advancements in design	of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now	being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance	neon sign co los angeles and industrial electric inc	new orleans la.	4.85987494172928
12698. the essential difference between the new	trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former	constructed of translucent plastic panels are lighted from within.	7.9169764620395915
12699. with the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of lumen output	as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light.	8.125023215785733
12700. also the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure	and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.	10.632008618716055
12701. the copy itself	including any text or illustrations is reproduced in full color directly	on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process.	6.053802915932458
12702. the	film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto	the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for	replacement by new copy as required.	9.563646643505882
12703. spare sets of face panels simplify	the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged	for the old right in the field on a single trip.	5.885377661243904
12704. panels with	outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.	9.023347552041894
12705. signs of this type have already made their appearance	in several larger cities and others are on the way.	8.480828947946517
12706. it is believed that	these boards will within the next few years replace many of the	conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.	12.357711292268942
12707. trans-illuminated	signs also show versatility in other directions.	5.289326539164407
12708. as used by industrial	electric inc the film panels are printed one at a time as	are 24-sheet posters.	9.987891314053527
12709. thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent	plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels	for use on cutouts or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin	faces.	7.315871864792654
12710. in this way the sign maker has an economical means for displaying	uniform copy on different sign media.	12.02497639176282
12711. recently industrial	electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern	plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign.	5.1609873974860445
12712. comprised of 16	triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections it makes it possible to	combine three different signs in a single unit.	8.198655322360592
12713. the triangles automatically	revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec of viewing time for	each poster subject.	6.224795502476297
12714. sixteen panels each slightly more than 1-12 ft	wide make up the 25-ft length of the sign.	6.629643030627454
12715. fill many needs	perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility	of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays	would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this	complex field- changeable signs.	7.967572459873234
12716. signs are meant to convey	a message and in most cases this requires words and letters.	10.157785584526536
12717. frequently	the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products	price changes etc.	6.119893499949245
12718. the huge market for changeable signs has spurred	a universal demand for individual plastic letters in all shapes	and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them.	9.357410034799823
12719. here	are some of the newer items currently available:   poster products	inc chicago ill: a changeable copy and display	sign	which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of	colors onto which are mounted snap-in letters figures or words screened	on acetate or other types of sheet stock.	4.20824578204803
12720. the background which	is available	in various widths and continuous lengths is extruded with	parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.	7.661112310954332
12721. the adaptaplex co beaverton ore; letters molded	of butyrate available in several sizes in either red or black.	5.425048378373969
12722. ideal	for merchandising use they are weather-resistant and have mounting	pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern	background panel.	7.12035484122961
12723. for large letters eg thermoformed	of acrylic or butyrate there are other techniques.	8.665960734925948
12724. for example	in a typical store installation fifty 24-in and six 36-in red	acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background.	6.230048262880536
12725. the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb each made	it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic	angle brackets cemented to the letters.	8.115308978301194
12726. stainless steel screws were	used to minimize corrosion stains.	9.158725481293297
12727. for mounting to corrugated plastic	backgrounds very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters	and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings its ends	twisted behind the panels.	6.621025294536722
12728. large injection-molded letters are	also available for sign installations.	7.075106986565477
12729. wagner sign service inc	chicago for example supplies them in several colors in heights of	4 6 8 10 and 17 inches.	6.012481157593974
12730. they are molded of a special weather-resistant	formulation of tenite butyrate.	9.53159798964741
12731. also available from this company	are snug-grip plasti-bars extruded of transparent acrylic material	which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.	4.942249274120986
12732. made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft the bars are shaped in cross	section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back	of the letters.	9.04857124098041
12733. still another approach to the changeable letter	type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products azusa	calif.	6.997802504893429
12734. this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in	panels formed of 0.	9.478798966729187
12735. 080-in clear butyrate sheet stock masked	and sprayed on the rear side.	5.376658115966269
12736. finished signs are produced by sliding	the separate letter panels into channels of 0.	8.145584750151526
12737. 025-in aluminum	which may be mounted to various surfaces.	5.3314275345343125
12738. the sheets are extruded of	tenite butyrate by jet specialties co los angeles calif.	10.109101563197154
12739. on large-area units where additional structural requirements	are imposed one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed	channels of the acrylic or butyrate.	5.148860424066596
12740. joined side by side such channels make possible construction	of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft high and	of unlimited width.	7.536651517992379
12741. letters may be wired to the face of the combined	channels painted on the first surface or handled in other ways.	7.83887535934798
12742. from	the inside out	don't insert your components into fixed openings	they may or may not fit; position your components before you close	them in.	6.870754834544905
12743. for example:   don't wall in your kitchen before	you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances.	5.16960336550101
12744. it's a lot quicker	and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect	the end wall after they are all in place.	5.8864405197473015
12745. set your bathtub before	you close in the end of the bathroom.	12.726748282521887
12746. don't try to wrestle a	400-lb tub f through a narrow doorway.	3.37680130099945
12747. finish your plumbing	before you frame it in	.	7.562675577130728
12748. finish installing and	connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them	in.	8.141751560621845
12749. there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a	furnace in a finished f closet.	11.705728733705584
12750. don't position your studs	before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way	you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the	window.	4.794730108605619
12751. you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows	in one two three order- first the stud on one side then the window	then the stud on the other side.	8.1882354219816
12752. install your disappearing	stair to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before	you drywall the ceiling.	7.501483648998703
12753. don't close in your house until everything	has been carried in.	3.52329780851524
12754. last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall	between the house and garage.	9.985781857349185
12755. that way he can truck his parts right	indoors and unload them under the roof.	8.266753730770816
12756. no auto maker would	dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons	in the block.	9.903872007899961
12757. and trailer makers those most industrialized and therefore	most efficient of homebuilders say they save hundreds of dollars	by always building from the inside out.	6.293519891756918
12758. everything	to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling	offers you	this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less	news of all because h  it makes it easy to handle much heavier	units so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated	components like those shown in the pictures alongside.	8.653549271467897
12759. it makes materials handling the only construction cost that	should be lower today than in 1929.	9.533070654614008
12760. it changes the answers to who should do what and where?	18.439417301290394
12761. 	it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases	the chance for shop fabrication where almost everything can be made	better and cheaper.	5.0173890991258725
12762. it changes the answers on when to do what	at the site.	17.805466770489577
12763. for example instead of putting in your driveways last	you can now save money by putting them in first.	8.071497855926063
12764. instead of closing the house in first you can	now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to	p	.	12.323217135079572
12765. it changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.	15.257047615913228
12766. not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs	by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer.	8.578121808381129
12767. but now many of	these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming	up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient	specialized equipment	to deliver everything just where it is needed-	drywall inside the house siding along the sides trusses on the walls	roofing on the roof etc.	6.538715242554389
12768. says clarence thompson: we	dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder	cheaper than he could do it himself.	6.666073754739248
12769. the revolution now under	the revolution	five years ago	a house + home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers'	research council reported unhappily:   only one lumber	dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car	in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer	in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder	in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.	4.210398257035352
12770. so	from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling	add up to one-fourth of the total construction	cost of housing.	7.245002480627926
12771. that house + home round table	was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials	handling says clarence thompson long chairman of the lumber dealers'	research council.	4.627158210634167
12772. it made our whole industry recognize	the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer carrier equipment	maker dealer and builder all working together to cut the cost	of materials handling.	9.913898597496026
12773. before that we lumber dealers were working	here is where things stand	today: almost all of the 3000 lumber dealers who cater	primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new	houses are mechanized.	4.0810058105209395
12774. there are few areas left where a builder cannot	find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything	at lower cost just where his workmen will need it.	9.942839470267906
12775. practically	all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized	or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber asphalt	shingles glass block face brick plaster lime hardboard gypsum	wallboard and sheathing cement insulation sheathing floor tile acoustical	tile plaster base and asbestos shingles.	4.485923855464368
12776. truck and	materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to	meet almost every homebuilding need.	6.300582640546342
12777. for some significant new items	see the pictures.	9.62392166030779
12778. more than 50% of all lumber is unitized;	an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will	strap their shipments for mechanized handling.	6.827542238010779
12779. of these 376 said they	make no extra charge for strapping in standard units because they	save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.	5.920167838255943
12780. most of the others	will swallow their 50 to $3 charge rather than lose	a good customer.	9.467722210924551
12781. with a 15500-lb fork-lift dealers can unload	unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30mbf compared	with $1.	4.5036777132165104
12782. 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time says	james wright of nlrda.	9.138466746172933
12783. lumber dealers and lumber	manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments-	48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high	.	5.025661190518743
12784. these units make it easy to	load as much as 48000 bd ft	car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars.	8.519111120601947
12785. the	railroads have responded by adding 20000 more box cars with doors 12'	or wider for forklift unloading	and by cutting their freight rates	twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars.	4.5131365951023925
12786. first was a 1958 cut	of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40000	lb; later came a 1961 cut on the west coast	of 7cwt on 70000 lb-plus carloads	more than $4mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70000	.	7.040746272866683
12787. more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars	and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type	6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.	5.797761832656915
12788. for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof	paper.	10.823360193808911
12789. this costs from 75 to $2.	10.87650017473367
12790. 30mbf but the cover can	these carriers	says nrlda's	james wright: since 1958 carriers that move material	from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes	than any of the dealer's other equipment.	5.903149393799429
12791. the reason: today's	components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled	by a truckdriver and a helper.	5.149333119793912
12792. so manufacturers have pioneered a new	type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier.	7.245040479879299
12793. it cuts the lumber dealer's	cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload	it and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction	of the cost of hand unloading.	6.665295029658753
12794. and it helps the builder because it	can handle a more efficiently packaged load can deliver it to the best	spot and never	takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.	7.741714785736745
12795. says wright: our survey shows that one third of the	retail	dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling	in the coming two years.	6.594836099558456
12796. and most of the gain will be in self-unloading	vehicles.	21.613720754704982
12797. to help them waste less of the time you pay for	half the manhours	you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right	so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right	time or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots	or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection or you	bought cheap materials that took too long to fit or your workmen had	to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.	6.662394707955726
12798. even america's most efficient builder bob schmitt	of berea hopes to cut his labor costs another $2000 per house as a	result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation	by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works.	6.235189785337579
12799. already	this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from	170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.	6.07568783862467
12800. builder	eddie carr of washington past president of nahb cut his bricklaying	costs $150 a house by adopting the scr masonry process	worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the structural	clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better	work for less.	5.914659983660362
12801. a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand	bricks from $81 to $43.	6.228141751434685
12802. 50 by adopting this same process cut them another	$7.	10.367230345868625
12803. 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient easy-to-spot 100-brick	packages.	5.319716259559957
12804. the scr process with its precision corner-posts	its precision guide lines its working level scaffold and its hand-level	brick supply takes eight manhours to get set but once ready	it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day.	6.520056209711356
12805. one good way to cut your labor waste is to make	sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew.	8.597332894906213
12806. reports	jim lendrum: by studying men on the job we found that two men-	a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three.	6.725765497925787
12807. we	found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall	panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men	don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper	team.	3.2532515030731783
12808. we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job	five men not four is the magic number.	11.509075439386718
12809. no house was ever	built that could not have been built better for less if the work had	been better planned and the work better scheduled.	7.722270438848933
12810. 5: don't waste any 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save 3	a stud	this is the most penny-wise pound-foolish chisel a builder	can commit.	4.263057666592364
12811. green lumber was all very well back in the days	of wet plaster when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then	shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum.	6.540565815186272
12812. but now that all production	builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels	green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.	9.763166427143505
12813. green	studs cost about 65; dry studs cost less than 3 more.	5.199126003694121
12814. so if	a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste	even 20 seconds the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry	stud.	7.717735686941839
12815. there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to	be alone.	13.317479913352763
12816. not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the	crowds and common happenstance.	12.342029396086023
12817. if you've travelled in europe a	time or two it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone	feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic.	5.276932511710202
12818. following a guide and gratefully so is an excellent way to	see all the important places when everything is strange and new.	8.586173334762814
12819. however	after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas the	places and forums the churches and museums the palaces and castles	and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe you'll want to	change your course and follow the by-roads at will far from the market	places.	4.719349348609958
12820. the champagne at troyes the traditional capital	of the champagne country has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has	at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d'argent.	8.385654483410171
12821. you	can relive history and follow in fancy the crusaders in their quest	for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi an ancient	town in the heel of italy's boot.	5.69826271827611
12822. and you don't meet the folks from	home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time	and tourists since the middle ages.	6.646891937413522
12823. time stands still as you climb	the narrow stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain	slopes or wander through story-book towns perched atop lofty crags	their faces turned to the sea.	5.134302880360168
12824. they've been there since the days	of the moors and the saracens.	6.1911253532712225
12825. and what better way to end a day	than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's	village on the mediterranean?	6.730309166994439
12826.    an almost too-simple-to-be-true	way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself	behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.	9.075071256622342
12827. for those	who need or want and can afford another car buying one and driving	it on the grand tour then shipping it home is one popular plan for	a do-it-yourself pilgrimage.	6.851579177624807
12828. then of course there are those of us	who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car.	11.64390018343959
12829. the answer	to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.	8.964396599643164
12830. almost any travel agent will reserve	a car for you.	10.373068723297546
12831. you can call one of the car rental services directly	and ask	them to reserve a car of your choice and some transportation lines	offer this service as well.	7.554228392767415
12832. with few exceptions your car will be waiting	for you at dockside airport railroad station or hotel when you	arrive oftentimes at no additional cost.	8.157712656367853
12833. you can wait of course until	you arrive in europe before renting your car.	9.3791847329925
12834. the disadvantages	to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models	readily available or you may have to wait a few days or during the busy	tourist season when cars are in great demand you might find it fairly	difficult to get a car at all.	11.291687020695903
12835. since charges are relatively the	same reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of	having one on tap when you want it.	6.778509947368026
12836. for those who plan to travel	to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer	a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave	it in another city or even another country when you are ready to	return home.	9.03643541668562
12837. at some cities this pick-up and delivery service is without	additional charge and if you are budget-wise when you are planning	your itinerary you will take advantage of these free delivery	and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries.	6.145979091887852
12838. international touring documents are usually provided	with the car as are road maps and touring data.	8.302629416080945
12839. a valid american	driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal spain	yugoslavia and eastern	europe.	7.344964412521004
12840. if you plan to visit any of these countries	you can obtain your international driving permit before you	leave at a nominal fee- around $3.	9.660791263772856
12841. your insurance too with	most agencies is provided with the car covering comprehensive fire	theft liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies	in different countries.	5.806611619675008
12842. if you would feel happier with full collision	insurance there is a small additional charge again varying from country	to country and depending on the term of such insurance.	11.399308076908651
12843. the average	charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.	7.35471785312943
12844. the charge is variable however and goes as low as 50 a day in	ireland and as high as $2.	12.437623694496713
12845. 00 a day in greece.	20.574721471893316
12846. rental fees	are variable too throughout the countries of europe.	10.169509762746841
12847. there are as	many rates as there are countries and models of cars available.	11.396545110747775
12848. as in	the united states there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus	a few cents per kilometer driven and the per-day rate drops if the car	is retained for a week.	8.166044238089878
12849. it drops again after fifteen andor twenty-one	days.	10.61789570863223
12850. it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from	80 to 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and	while you might prefer a familiar ford chevrolet or even a cadillac	which are available in some countries it is probably wiser to choose	the smaller european makes which average thirty thirty-five and	even forty miles to the gallon.	9.876455735943448
12851. your choice of model will undoubtedly	be governed by the number of people travelling in your group.	8.71415671431989
12852. with the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny sedans will	seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage	space for really economical transportation.	11.025099206551433
12853. there is a large variety	of models to choose from in most countries however including 6-passenger	sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that	much greater than for the wee sedans.	6.604632728670292
12854. the basic costs are generally	pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you	reserve your car but some of them offer supplementary advantages.	11.63504343975877
12855. there is the free intra-city rent it here leave it there service	as an example the free delivery and collection at the airport dockside	or your hotel luggage racks touring documents and information	and other similar services.	6.56635415893037
12856. a little investigation by telephone or reading	the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these	pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits.	8.382805718750388
12857. the investigation	will be well worth your time.	8.937264895279958
12858. all model cars are not	available in all countries.	11.231703310599883
12859. quite naturally there is a greater availability	of those models which are manufactured within a specific country.	6.746320583988678
12860. if you would like to start your tour in italy where the rental	fees are actually the lowest in europe fiats in all sizes are available	as are alfa romeo giulietta models.	9.66898330613258
12861. if you wish to budget	closely on transportation saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries	one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1.	7.975980452929095
12862. 26 a day plus 3	a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station	wagon seating six at just	$1.	8.199990270455922
12863. 10 a day and 10-12 a kilometer.	8.055163223965481
12864. if you will be using your car	more than fifteen days which isn't all unlikely the daily rates	drop quite sharply to 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal	30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon.	10.00080830110733
12865. with six in the	group the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily	fee.	7.9837690407982125
12866. in the majority of countries however the rates range from	$3.	15.655175367251124
12867. 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.	11.186257729072544
12868. 00 a day for the larger luxury european models with the rate	per kilometer driven starting at 3 and going up as high as 12.	14.267583080589937
12869. the same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet	not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate	or rate per kilometer driven.	7.335894088111847
12870. the variations are not too great.	14.232578686232126
12871. rates	for american cars are somewhat higher ranging from about $8.	6.902294398077003
12872. 00 a day	up to $14.	18.901549165966053
12873. 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible but the rate per	kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models.	11.066177713271154
12874. rates in greece and finland are fairly high actually the highest	in europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in ireland.	8.307455899954297
12875. if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a	month it might be wise for you to lease a car.	10.44406199407615
12876. the actual over-all	cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the	rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new	car.	11.155907421083246
12877. you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner	which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized	dealers throughout europe.	8.46348126248016
12878. further there is no mileage charge	or mileage limitations when you lease a car and you pay only the flat	monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since	the car is registered and insured individually for your trip.	8.161182227018006
12879. there is	a fairly wide selection of models of english german and french manufacture	from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 citroe^n	2 cv volkswagens renaults to the 6-passenger simca	beaulieu.	5.955978489639778
12880. leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a	car in europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical	and satisfactory.	9.05007919578834
12881. after the first month rates are considerably	less averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger	models.	6.217834686872212
12882. there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent	cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan.	12.63466457235401
12883. for one thing the driver	usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes	pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road.	8.77238181688772
12884. then	too european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on	the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed	up with them.	7.311209309267866
12885. still there is a way for those who want to see some	of the back country of europe by car.	10.53984696035598
12886. the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven	car.	18.376523256179272
12887. it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.	7.1213837902996975
12888. your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.	7.717178666426485
12889. 00	a day but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger	cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800.	5.172319525439913
12890. the big	spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven being governed by	the rate at which gasoline is consumed.	10.529813214450504
12891. since most european cars average	more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars it naturally	follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less	but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize	this provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger	limousine.	5.8430167600736285
12892. the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars	vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for	the drive-yourself cars.	12.709132351174516
12893. however whether you arrange to have a european	or american model if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity	in relation to the number of people in your party your transportation	expense will average very close to $10.	8.039562038396895
12894. 00 per day per passenger.	21.279195457146663
12895. this will include your helpful english-speaking chauffeur and a	drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day.	6.883969448364331
12896. if you drive greater	distances than that you'll just be skimming the surface and will	never discover the enchantment fascination and beauty which lured	you in the first place to explore the hinterlands.	8.951901290813069
12897. of course if you	want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac	limousine just for you and your bride you'll have a memorable	tour but it won't be cheap and it is not recommended unless you own	a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the irish sweepstakes.	5.087514397611761
12898. in american romance almost nothing rates higher than what the	movie men have called meeting cute- that is boy-meets-girl	seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct	and acute boredom.	6.293523252233691
12899. just about the most enthralling real-life example	of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga:	reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts but he said	simultaneously i wish they were emeralds.	5.4517433549239716
12900. aside from the comico-romantico	content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily	pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the	conversation to go on.	8.87617676972946
12901. the way macarthur said his line- if	you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would	probably have gone like this: f primary stresses on emeralds and	wish; note pitch 3 on emeralds but with a slight degree	of drawl one degree of oversoftness h.	4.382473370184722
12902. conclusions: the people	involved knew clearly the relative	values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental.	6.6971736919672225
12903. and the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt	was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.	6.701489161234436
12904. in	other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they	shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of english	words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can	change their meaning from black to white.	8.29012646902318
12905. at this point unfortunately	romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider	if you can bear it what might have happened if macarthur for	some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an eskimo	girl in eskimo.	6.7223705709765165
12906. to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just	so much blubber.	11.931966854862646
12907. the point- quite simply- is this: words they	might have had; but communication no.	3.317168690870809
12908. this basic principle	the first in a richly knotted bundle was conveyed to me by dr henry	lee smith jr at the university of buffalo where he heads	the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.	7.908747038104907
12909. a	brisk amusing man apparently constructed on an ingenious system of	spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind smith	began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls- a project	considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young	rat named arthur who never could make up his mind.	4.875321856346226
12910. later he	became one of the central spirits of the army language program and	the language school of washington's foreign service institute.	9.09698960927569
12911. it was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture	shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he	first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication.	9.562713226615257
12912. to the trained ear of the linguist talk has always	revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker-	such things as geographical origin andor history socio-economic identity	education.	7.771107555347635
12913. it is only fairly recently however that linguists	have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way	that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure	of human communication between two people.	7.984352443777376
12914. this for obvious reasons	makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric	interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used	to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.	9.9541306249428
12915. in the early 1950's smith together with his distinguished	colleague george trager	and a third man with the engaging name	of birdwhistell agreed on some basic premises about the three-part	process that makes communication: paralanguage	a set of phenomena including laughing weeping voice breaks	and tone of voice and kinesics the technical name for	gestures facial expressions and body shifts- nodding or shaking the	head talking with one's hands et cetera.	4.231026908648922
12916. smith's	first workout with stresses pitches and junctures was based on mother	which spells in our culture a good deal more than bread alone.	8.238759585200004
12917. for example if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person there are	certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.	7.793508413220221
12918. the usual us norm would be: f middle pitches slight	pause before mother slight rise at the end.	7.623204062847507
12919. the symbols	of mother's status here are all usual for culture usa.	5.919694376612622
12920. quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: f note the	drop to pitch 1 on mother with no rise at the end of the	sentence; this is a fade ending and what you have here is a	downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional	respect for mother.	8.43414801750584
12921. even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie	goes with: f in other words the way the speaker relates to mother	is clearly indicated.	5.821821440208345
12922. and while the meaning of the words is not in	this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second	and third examples is definitely impaired.	12.996472801086021
12923. an accompanying record	of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a	throaty	rasp.	6.696884094334855
12924. with this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly	thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling	things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that	he had departed from the customs of his culture.	9.34691226501092
12925. the joint investigations	of linguistics and psychiatry have established in point	of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words	are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling	over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate	to the rest of the world.	7.802327836421239
12926. since interviewing is the basic therapeutic	and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of	interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions	in new research and training.	7.608489172038199
12927. some of the earliest recordings	made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately	to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records	of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if	they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most	skilled and sensitive experts.	5.037837379970434
12928. in a general way psychiatrists were	able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-	that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic that such	things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not	necessarily by words.	7.678814822176658
12929. at a minimum recording- usually on tape	which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview	alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored	repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists.	6.296088963033226
12930. newest	to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have	carried that minimum to a new level.	7.317765943484449
12931. by adding a systematic analysis	with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews they have supplied	a new set of techniques for the therapist.	6.546145070552138
12932. linguistic charting of	the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs	from expected norms.	5.734439303953892
12933. it flags such possible breakdowns of communication	as rehearsed dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence	or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at	all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.	4.996022557857902
12934. interpretation naturally remains the role of the therapist but	orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical	and socio-economic background but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways	of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably	beefed up by the linguist.	5.273609083364006
12935. his esoteric chartings of the voice alert	the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying	psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the	therapist and eventually to the patient.	5.876702259642965
12936. in one now-historic first	interview	for example the transcript	goes like this: f the therapist's level	tone is bland and neutral- he has for example avoided stressing	you which would imply disapproval; or surprise which would	set the patient apart from other people.	5.533784951058294
12937. the patient on the other	hand is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent	she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed	a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity	with literary or scientific language	and she is telling a story she	has mentally rehearsed some time before.	5.4906312757694264
12938. then she catapults into everything	and everybody putting particular violence on everybody	indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that	is it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up	to this point.	7.501756472031121
12939. consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention.	8.42833777360374
12940. he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably	not the true target of her resentment.	11.497591597774793
12941. immediately thereafter the	patient fractures her rehearsed story veering into an oversoft breathy	sloppily articulated i don't feel like talking right now.	3.720297629325874
12942. within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent	to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's	husband.	11.931851880770912
12943. she says later but still within the opening five minutes	i keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death.	5.549001392787433
12944. the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are	all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain	signals that she does not accept divorce.	8.163288768187833
12945. by saying another emotional	death she reveals that there has been a previous one although	she has not described it in words.	8.510800126625245
12946. this the therapist may pursue	in	later questioning.	13.234235534322758
12947. the phrase emotional death interesting and	to a non-scientific mind rather touching suggests that this woman	may have some flair for words perhaps even something of the temperament	regrettably called creative.	5.796228920163833
12948. since the psychiatric interview	like any other interview depends on communication it is significant	to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked	skill and long experience.	9.755236708090566
12949. his own communication apparatus operated	superbly and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total	lack of resemblance to the blunted monumentally unmeshed mechanism of	dr blauberman.	5.472172416478268
12950. interestingly enough- although none of the real-life	therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman-	when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered	any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview	techniques; almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions	on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.	7.087929134686204
12951. yet in spite of this intensive study of the taped interviews	by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact	that in the first five minutes of an initial interview the patient	often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;	to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively	or scientifically how to listen.	5.955526167016994
12952. naturally the patient does not say	i hate my father or sibling rivalry is what bugs me.	8.900721842206359
12953. what he does do	is give himself away by communicating information over	and above the words involved.	8.919739774220355
12954. some of the classic indicators as described	by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first	five minutes are these:  stammering	or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal	ambiguity	or uncertainty.	7.812366189616389
12955. on the other hand significant facts may be concealed-	she may mean i; or everybody as it did with the tense	and irritable woman mentioned before may refer to a specific person.	6.295715931699577
12956. the word that is not used can be as important as the word that	is used; therapist andor linguist must always consider the alternatives.	10.438436320333553
12957. when someone says for example they took x rays to	see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how	this statement would normally be made.	7.9652774280416265
12958. was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the	fact	h amateur linguists note here that pursewarden in durrell's	alexandria quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which	is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.	8.97256903647311
12959. she was just another freighter from the states and she seemed	as commonplace as her name.	8.555332459356665
12960. she was the john harvey one	of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans	bombs and bullets to the us fifteenth air force to field	marshal montgomery's eighth army then racing up the calf of the	boot of italy in that early december of 1943.	7.230418196002308
12961. the john harvey	arrived in bari a port on the adriatic on november 28th	making for porto nuovo which as the name indicates was the ancient	city's new and modern harbor.	5.995695037479656
12962. hardly anyone ashore marked her as	she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole.	7.00571899939639
12963. if anyone thought	of the john harvey it was to observe that she was straddled by	a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit	the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and	whatever else it was that she carried.	6.895103768299182
12964. it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt	before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of	mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront.	9.950332565533571
12965. for in a world	as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud poison gas	was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.	8.362803918360411
12966. throughout	the early years of world war 2 reports persisted that the	axis powers had used gas- germany in russia japan in china again.	10.31838336299576
12967. influential people in america were warning	the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by	the germans in future campaigns.	5.886188538938161
12968. some extremists went so far as to	urge our using it first.	11.04452643823658
12969. to silence extremists to warn the axis president	roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august:	from time to time since the present war began there have	been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating	use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices	of warfare.	6.132990461059712
12970. i have been loath to believe that any nation even our	present enemies could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such	terrible and inhumane weapons.	10.76750315269283
12971. however evidence that the	axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an	intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety	of sources.	6.438511763405181
12972. use of such weapons has been outlawed by the	general opinion of civilized mankind.	10.787208589968738
12973. this country has not used them	and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them.	8.8857047184274
12974. i state categorically	that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such	weapons unless they are first used by our enemies.	12.159713910782118
12975. the	following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave	effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in	southern italy.	5.911058022565153
12976. bari was chosen as a depot not only for its seeming	safety but because of its proximity to airfields.	11.183472873128832
12977. any retaliatory	gas attack would be airborne.	8.23607959277268
12978. it would be made in three waves- the	first to lay down a smokescreen the second to drop the gas bombs the	third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.	9.595521654610065
12979. so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey.	10.015464374686898
12980. a	detachment	of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under	first lt howard d beckstrom went aboard followed by lt	thomas h richardson the cargo security officer.	7.390824843171834
12981. only a few other people- very important people- knew	of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks.	4.393022784140953
12982. no one else must	know.	17.606520504655787
12983. thus in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that	knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy	at bari.	7.9275247591458085
12984. it was the night of december 2 1943 and it was growing	dark in bari.	16.474713023137976
12985. it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german	me-210	plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit.	6.3188263723557245
12986. capt	a b jenks of the office of harbor defense was very	worried.	9.71644232247944
12987. he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning	to the attack in italy.	7.281518289842213
12988. on november 24th they had made a raid on la	maddalena.	15.064684447444867
12989. two days later some 30 of them had struck at a convoy	off bougie sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that	the me-210 had made its first appearance.	5.346291238846517
12990. after it had reappeared	the next two nights jenks went to higher headquarters and said:	for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been	over the city taking pictures.	7.850101095207049
12991. they're just waiting for the proper	time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic.	4.668277521602509
12992. but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.	11.255043804905261
12993. even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now	being directed by the young and energetic general peltz the commander	who would conduct the little blitz on london in 1944 a	major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered	seriously.	7.947437744137529
12994. true there had been raids on naples- but naples was	pretty far north on the opposite coast.	8.58962976661204
12995. no bari was out of range.	12.4807061905763
12996. more than that allied air had complete superiority in the eighth	army's sector.	12.762668886529735
12997. so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch	the scouting plane put in five more appearances and to feel the	certainty of this dread rising within him.	6.307837045074947
12998. for jenks knew that bari's	defenses were made of paper.	9.17709793823586
12999. the royal air force had but a single	light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available.	5.973605815807499
13000. there	were no raf fighter squadrons on bari airfield.	8.679230688238626
13001. the	radar station with the best location was still not serviceable.	8.01113818146358
13002. and everywhere in evidence among the few	remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple	command.	9.366059271220925
13003. it had been made shockingly evident that very morning	to ensign kay k vesole in charge of the armed guard aboard the	john bascom.	9.365557941371543
13004. a british officer had come aboard and told him	that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs	were actually dropped.	11.33064023259142
13005. then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a	radar-controlled	shore gun firing white tracers.	5.70303237002511
13006. this harbor is	a bomber's paradise the britisher had said with frank grimness.	7.686931099827415
13007. it's up to you to protect yourselves.	3.6363699627123283
13008. we can't expect any	help from the fighters at foggia either.	6.321012992566557
13009. they're all being used on	offensive missions.	3.366607046592737
13010. not fire until	the bombs came down! he thought of the tons and tons of flammable	fluid beneath his feet and shook his head.	8.688740685024351
13011. like hell! like hell	he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out?	3.390279038067659
13012. 	what would his guns guide on then- the north star?	6.843605803298536
13013.  ensign	vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering	of the bombs and when night began to fall he put seaman 2c donald	l norton and seaman 1c william a rochford on the guns	and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.	6.331582676840358
13014. below decks seaman 1c stanley bishop had begun to write	a letter home.	9.300511043031467
13015. above decks on the john harvey lieutenant	richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and	felt uneasy.	7.313355868380442
13016. there were lights glinting in the city too even though	it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible.	12.603938481931543
13017. bari was	asking for it he thought.	9.063597439696204
13018. for five days now they had been	in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold.	12.079653569871468
13019. richardson wondered	when it would be unloaded.	9.751656435710705
13020. he hoped they would put it somewhere way	way down in the earth.	12.857849571117027
13021. the burden of his secret was pressing down	on him as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men.	8.267454081333447
13022. lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john	harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing	more dangerous than high explosive bombs.	8.343733051399635
13023. they seemed happy at the	delay in unloading glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty	port such as bari.	7.898884813083424
13024. nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.	13.76081884192574
13025. deck cadet james l cahill and seaman walter brooks had	been the first to leave.	6.14067764668679
13026. richardson had returned their departing grins	with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in	trade.	7.719297337811341
13027. the other half of the crew plus beckstrom and his men	had remained aboard.	11.541662555446887
13028. richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.	10.433017676368602
13029. damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor-	porto vecchio.	5.589005499421161
13030. the night was so clear that richardson had no	difficulty making out the silhouette.	10.47997003870356
13031. then the thought of a cloudless	sky made him shiver and he glanced upward.	8.681408012412158
13032. it was a clear night and it was raining!   capt michael	a musmanno military governor of the sorrentine peninsula had	also seen and felt the rain.	11.392211174992767
13033. but he had mistaken it for bugs.	15.332652761009879
13034. captain musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant	name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed	olive oil for the sorrentine's civilian population.	5.822968360612288
13035. at exactly 7:30 he felt a fluttering object brush	his face.	6.1091042696124145
13036. he snatched at it savagely.	15.508174794367365
13037. he turned the beam of his flashlight	on it.	9.886497110712357
13038. it was the silver foil from the chocolate	bar he had been eating.	15.651925650068954
13039. but how could-?	18.148771366658917
13040.  another	longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth.	8.991344112716462
13041. it was two feet long.	17.875979093802663
13042. it was	not candy wrapping.	20.63932416398423
13043. it was window- the tinsel paper	dropped by bombers to jam radar sets to fill the scope with hundreds	of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.	7.316279272584076
13044. fermate!	musmanno bellowed to his italian crewmen.	7.113352622123642
13045. stop! stop	the engines!   unsinkable slowed and stopped hundreds	of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black the air	raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek the anti-aircraft guns coughed	and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came	whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor	at bari.	4.00158104992748
13046. they had come from airports in the balkans these	hundred-odd junkers 88's.	9.985156563721329
13047. they had winged over the adriatic they	had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her	attacking with deadly skill.	7.211196234716649
13048. they had ruined the radar warning system	with their window they had made themselves invisible above their flares.	10.197681703743203
13049. and they also had the lights of the city the port wall lanterns	and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on.	7.9315116479691445
13050. after the first two	were blacked out the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian	crew who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring	homing beacon until british mp's shot it out.	7.403949123037977
13051. in that	interval the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor.	7.932756031003807
13052. merchant	ships illuminated in the light of the flares made to seem like	stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss.	9.466725599340284
13053. the little unsinkable sank almost immediately.	9.319418089372073
13054. captain musmanno	roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for	a raft.	9.148351106390253
13055. they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few	minutes before their schooner went under.	7.808781322732049
13056. john bascom	went down early too.	11.134214079492786
13057. ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly	but they had no targets.	6.414812995486282
13058. most of the junkers were above the	blinding light of the flares and the radar-controlled shore gun had	been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs.	10.637462811674501
13059. vesole rushed	from gun to gun attempting to direct fire.	6.736618473800383
13060. he was wounded but fought	on.	18.063654829409522
13061. norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.	7.371415139514985
13062. bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20mm gun pumping out 400 rounds	before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one three and	five.	7.337530395759512
13063. now the bascom was mortally wounded.	10.00818430062466
13064. luckily she was	not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.	8.853347130226778
13065. the order to abandon ship was given but cries of pain could	be heard from the wounded below decks.	7.550128284212195
13066. there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at	you wondering why you are staring open-mouthed in amazement.	10.903370874869214
13067. you explain	i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this	very same event before.	9.710680874678793
13068. i can't tell when but i'm positive i witnessed	this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in	the past!   this experience will have happened to many of	you.	5.471845564952906
13069. emerson in his lecture refers to the h startling experience	which almost every person confesses in daylight that particular	passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same	order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have	been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard	precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when.	5.8986368127282915
13070. most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling	as the deja vue illusion just as they dismiss	dream previsions as coincidences.	8.533423336450705
13071. in this manner they side-step the seemingly	hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which	all of us grope continually.	7.3716750901103785
13072. when a man recognizes a certain	experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance	of deja vue	except for the fact that he knows just why the experience	seems familiar.	12.328096614480893
13073. occasionally there are examples of prevision	which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.	6.128979007423832
13074. one day maeterlinck coming with a friend upon an event	which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed	the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion	was completely mystified.	9.291918693655902
13075. rudyard kipling's scorn for the jargon	of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered	h how or why had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life	film?	4.879167688732594
13076.  the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something	about myself.	10.337007854526608
13077. one day when he attended a war memorial	ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout	man on his left his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the	rough slab flooring and someone clasping him by the arm whispered	i want a word with you please.	6.487371184031529
13078. at that moment kipling was	overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical	details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six	weeks earlier.	10.205138506911496
13079. freud probably contributed more than anyone else	to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents	in our wakeful thoughts.	6.168128358224057
13080. however readers who accept freud's	findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of	dreams should ponder over the following words in his interpretation	of dreams chapter 1: h as a matter of fact no such	complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case	and what is more every one attempting such solution has found that	in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream	the source of which he has been unable to explain h nor is the discussion	closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams.	8.23987926592398
13081. dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance	prevision and retrovision.	6.32142965760001
13082. the basic mystery of dreams which embraces	all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical	dream is in the fact that they are original visual continuities.	11.771613415765334
13083. i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i	lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town.	7.328281683272574
13084. i am	sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence	so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news pictures	i have seen.	7.242390589605886
13085. and when psychology explains glibly but the subconscious	mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely	identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably	as part of the individual mind.	7.91070900894255
13086. skeptics may deny the	more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally	observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance	of routine evidence.	7.800799849703424
13087. the question becomes what is	a dream?	10.477722647015966
13088.    is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?	12.881389680613305
13089. 	every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type	even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful	thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.	7.370570002615285
13090. in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects.	12.219819853129067
13091. but these are dreamed in original action in some particular continuity	which we don't remember having seen in real life.	5.507569779527357
13092. for instance	the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with	photographic realism sees smith driving the car; whereas it is	a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car.	6.94271127002003
13093. there is nothing to	suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original	realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.	8.29402207690361
13094. the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of	a mental image can find no logical support.	9.701066190093464
13095. a mental image subconsciously	impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful	thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at	all but is comprised of realities viewed not in the concurrent sensory	stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension.	6.594046178743028
13096. dreams	that display events of the future with photographic detail call	for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including	that weird feeling of deja vue inevitably fantastic though	that theory must seem.	8.43961990545275
13097. as in the theory of perception established	in psycho-physiology the eye is recognized as an integral part	of the brain.	9.113838786943589
13098. but then this theory confesses that it is completely at	a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain.	13.621046802025703
13099. the	opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative	perception in the book philosophies of science by	albert g ramsperger says h passed on to the brain and there	by some unexplained process it causes the mind to have a perception.	6.3579828529803555
13100. but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image	within the brain?	15.604198763434159
13101.  as retinal images are conceded to be an integral	function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between	the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation	from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the	transmission	of an image which is already in required location.	6.5122203967844925
13102. hereby	the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen	not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive	cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory	centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness.	8.703230235948961
13103. modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists	of minute waves of energy.	7.484382641225106
13104. we know that the number of radio and	television impulses sound waves ultra-violet rays etc that may	occupy	the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite.	9.426999922074662
13105. so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal	apparently momentary states of matter successive one after	another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of	the progressive frequencies.	6.036057655954809
13106. this theory makes it possible for any	event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to	consciousness.	13.371047803467357
13107. space in any form is completely measured by the	three dimensions.	8.3417642967937
13108. if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and	not purely metaphysical through what medium does it extend?	11.840978020778955
13109.  it is	not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science	fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past	or the ever-existent past-fantasy future.	7.213222249385693
13110. three seconds flat is the	usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the	overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static	pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which	perpetuate all events.	7.304659537989429
13111. the body senses and brain in common with	all matter have their counterpart on each of a countless number of	frequencies.	7.218873530030685
13112. the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only	of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other	frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them.	7.878821233548822
13113. consciousness	is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory	impressions.	6.825120675889578
13114. when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the	wakeful world it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present	past and future in a life as vibrant and real as the one left	when the body tired and required sleep.	9.039991375842
13115. if the photographically	realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations	denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded	from views of diverse realities although some of them may never	be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.	8.334574597802703
13116. dr	h v hilprecht professor of assyrian at the university	of pennsylvania dreamed that a babylonian priest associated with	the king kurigalzu escorted him to the treasure	chamber of the temple of bel gave him six novel points of information	about a certain broken relic and corrected an error in its identification.	7.465809266195426
13117. as a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result	of many weeks of labor by dr hilprecht was about to be published	by him the following day.	9.512309454466271
13118. some time later the missing part of the relic	was found and the complete inscription together with other new evidence	fully corroborated the ancient priest's information.	9.02485388054109
13119. dr	hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest	in his dream.	7.788228058650403
13120. he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite	and imagined it must have been german or english.	12.418250249045798
13121. we may	conclude that all six points of information ostensibly given by the	dream priest could have been furnished by dr hilprecht's	subconscious reasoning.	6.617060019616585
13122. but in denying any physical reality for	this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly	visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or	sudden substitution?	8.488419778201234
13123.  which theory is more fantastic: 1.	8.299524254997841
13124. that the	perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions	in the professor's brain or 2.	7.303694628427547
13125. that the dream was a reality on the	infinite progressions of universal gradient frequencies across which	the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met?	6.377689512839156
13126. 	the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines	whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or	the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling.	7.010194575284957
13127. no	doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the	sleeper's mind.	5.468951291336806
13128. probably less than one percent of our previsions	escape final obliteration before we wake.	10.485268287257908
13129. when we arrive at the events	concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot impress	us as anything familiar.	8.058568248094575
13130. nevertheless there are notably frequent	instances of deja vue in which our recognition of an entirely novel	event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which	though vague withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive	corps of psychologists.	9.905000759152728
13131. if deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly	it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most	level-headed people.	6.656480151392448
13132. chauncey depew one-time runner-up for	the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention	at saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt	for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary	chairman was a man he had never met.	7.617780520137311
13133. after the preliminary business	affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech	that clinched the nomination for roosevelt.	6.437426718645391
13134. if depew had told any	academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through	that identical convention session at some time in the past he would	have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue.	12.854526566833073
13135. but the famous	orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene.	9.045594928312365
13136. he remembered	exactly when he had lived through it before and he had something	to prove he had.	14.046695883373621

13140. because	the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care	for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients	the food does taste good.	8.229426888789177
13141. when served in a psychological	atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from	what they eat because they are free from tension a foundation is laid	for a high level of health that releases the children from physical	handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments the	athletic programs and the most important phase the educational opportunities.	6.540653544324496
13142. situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain	scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open	fields	and farm lands.	11.228644219640616

13152. mr clark	found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers	and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles	of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato	fields and depreciation of the soil.	7.564664688620292
13153. to give up these	notions required a revolution in thought mr clark said in reminiscing	about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began	reading organic gardening and modern nutrition in a	search for help with his problems.	6.0466538153651355
13154. louis bromfield's writings	excited me as a conservationist.	8.705754868551768

13162. years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed	the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity.	10.040979088430484
13163. soon after	the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate	his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment	alone that accomplished this.	7.094241491006065
13164. to demonstrate the soil	of his vegetable gardens as it is today mr clark stooped to scoop	up a handful of rich dark earth.	10.202622364168544
13165. sniffing its sweet smell and letting	it fall to show its good crumbly consistency he pointed to the nearby	driveway and said this soil used to be like that hard packed	road over there.	5.921188106849412

13283. as a matter	of fact fogg and his plane didn't get beyond pennsylvania in the	race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service	and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his	wry-faced backers.	4.511210185983005

13287. the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back	of the state house when the wind was right and used wilson flat	above barre when it wasn't.	7.306856095319817
13288. between the unsafe towne field and the	long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to	wilson flat arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.	9.318206710636288
13289. each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal	officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably	on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river.	5.742661555184093
13290. but	fogg they countered we can't get over there.	5.193113796040117
13291. and besides you	seem to make it all right here.	12.731859921594818
13292. it took a tragedy to bring things	to a head.	15.740137742762412
13293. after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind	takeoffs fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage	of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field.	6.321866290719938

13296. faced with this situation postmaster	charles f mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington	trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights	of berlin.	8.30861219439367
13297. a long flat known as the st john field seemed to answer	their purpose and since the winooski bridges were at last passable	they decided to use it.	8.923435707781733
13298. with a wary eye on the farmer's	bull fred somers of montpelier and mr st john marked the	field with a red table cloth.	9.073747554583575
13299. as a wind direction indicator they tied	a cotton rag to a sapling.	8.359347129342588
13300. with these aids and a pair of skiis substituting	for wheels on the waco bob fogg made the first landing on	what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21	1927.	8.327579531746226

13302. during the second week of operations fogg received a telegram	from the post office department asking him to put on two airplanes	and make two flights daily plus one sunday trip.	11.550843143173653
13303. since	fogg's was a one-man one-plane flying service this meant that he	would have to do both trips flying alone 600 miles a day under sub-freezing	temperature conditions.	4.591344436132615
13304. over the weeks america's	first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the	vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.	8.540543227884637
13305. each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into	flying togs over the furnace register of his home.	6.685516908479443
13306. always troubled	by poor circulation in his feet he experimented with various combinations	of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's	boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them.	6.133425875274956
13307. a sheep-lined	leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed	his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit.	5.999206540444584
13308. the airman's stock answer	to weren't you cold?	6.539108308371779
13309.  became yes the first half hour	is tough but by then i'm so numb i don't notice it!	as daylight began to show through the frosty windows fogg would	place a call to william a shaw at the u s weather station	at northfield vermont for temperature and wind-velocity readings.	4.430942280893483
13310. shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility	by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.	9.90150778268048
13311. ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights	and cloud positions.	6.76903327372683

13313. out at the airport each morning fogg's	skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running	in the drafty hangar.	6.9822425975067945
13314. wishing to show that aviation	was dependable and here to stay bob fogg always made a point	of taking off each morning on the dot of seven disregarding rain snow	and sleet in true postal tradition.	7.669617764206725
13315. concord learned to set its clocks	by the rackety bark of the whirlwind's exhaust overhead.	5.5759561057451075
13316. sometimes	the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog but 85% of his	trips were completed.	6.845752444306413
13317. plane radios were not yet available	and once in the air fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for	landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick	computation.	5.718944671852484
13318. often threading through the overcast he was forced	to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the winooski	or the white river along the line of the broken railroad.	9.187417133960148
13319. when	driving rain or mist socked in one valley fogg would chandelle up	and over to reverse course and try another one ranging from the ottauquechee	up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain	passes.	5.895970771687542
13320. the dependable wright engine was never stopped on	these trips.	9.921218735923679
13321. it ticked over smoothly idling while fogg exchanged	mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen	and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field.	7.026918954778754
13322. sometimes on a return trip the aviator would go upstairs high	over the clouds.	9.125372650949783
13323. there he'd take a compass heading figure his	air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over	the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe	to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.	6.233823155951095
13324. bob fogg didn't have today's advantages of instrument flight	and ground control approach systems.	4.849493653909611
13325. at the end of the calculated	time he'd nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break	through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.	8.000897708579153
13326. usually back in concord by noon there was just time	to get partially thawed out refuel and grab a bit of mrs fogg's	hot broth before starting the second trip.	7.660722689147123
13327. day after day fogg shuttled	back and forth on his one-man air mail route until the farmers	in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the	stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.	5.818461511240167
13328. the	flyer had his share of near-misses.	12.125440818040227
13329. at fort ethan allen the ever-present	wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing	like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated.	5.037466083638796
13330. once the soldiers from	the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved	the engine and got the tail up.	9.961763915198578
13331. at a nod of his head they let go	turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream.	7.717936472067454

13337.  what do	i do now?	11.344590736147854
13338.    yes retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.	11.089417618188875

13344. suddenly one day up it	pops! sixty-five years and you've had it!   so now what?	4.785663013029545
13345. 	oh sure! you've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way.	5.79323993717505
13346. but! it never seemed real; never seemed as if it could happen	to you; only to the other fellow.	7.309022407717114

13356. you never are late	for work and seldom absent.	12.993475824014082
13357. actually you can take no special	credit for this.	8.700394934467367
13358. it is the way you were taught and your way of	life.	21.900220229568564
13359. all this is standard equipment for a man of your day; your stock	in trade; your livelihood.	7.437187229776641
13360. however the last few years	of your life things seem to be changing.	13.9146260295102
13361. your way doesn't seem to	be so darned important any more.	4.860821534312142
13362. you realize you are getting in the old	fogy class.	14.053180966007336

13368. all sorts of plans come to life.	14.956459123440055

13370. yes sir! conferences become very popular.	8.271991465218145
13371. when a plan	burst its seams hasty conferences supply the necessary patch and life	goes merrily on.	6.8690402747709935

13380. some have serenity of mind the ability to accept	what they have and make the most of it	- some see only darkness the bitter side of everything.	9.889920444301145
13381. well whatever you have that's it! you've got to learn to	live with it.	4.290556490883223
13382. now! the question is how are you going to	live with it?	8.178516368362626
13383. 	you can sit back and moan and bewail your	lot.	6.5031440217888905
13384. yes! you can do this.	9.324576499568167
13385. but if you do your life will	be just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.	7.56685394238959
13386. it	seems to me the first thing you've got to do to be happy is to	face up to your problems no matter what they may be.	9.953641789530508
13387. make up your mind	to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years	of life.	7.388792479059098
13388. one thing i am sure of you must get an interest in life.	17.877901390354616
13389. you've got to do something.	5.1289490173070815
13390. many of you will say well	what can i do?	15.568023798232003
13391.    believe me! there are many many things	to do.	5.767136796850576
13392. find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.	17.370908648990255
13393. if you can't think of a thing to do try something- anything.	6.455336652255135
13394. maybe you will surprise yourself.	15.051448519934711
13395. true! we are not all great	artists.	6.030446863119059
13396. i frankly can't draw a straight line.	8.253159232391898
13397. maybe you are	not that gifted either but how about puttering around with the old paints?	7.635129120099034
13398. 	you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it.	7.830013934547171
13399. anyway	i'll bet you have a lot of fun.	7.333964287973992

13405. some	women can sit and sew crochet tat or knit by the hour and look	calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work.	5.939962192822345
13406. where sewing is concerned	i'm a total loss.	8.453756633934061
13407. when you see a needle in my hands you will	know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on	or get out the safety pins.	9.481981597518494
13408. then again there's always that	lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs.	6.569884124821811
13409. not for me but perhaps	just the thing for you.	9.411971108334857
13410. well! how's about mosaic	tile ceramics or similar arts and crafts?	5.890542256038402
13411.  some people love to	crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with	as a result of their cracking good time.	5.680660789362169
13412. how about the art of	cooking?	19.095933915039815
13413.  do you yearn to make cakes and pies or special cookies	and candies?	8.019441549714335
13414.  there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy	in spite of low calorie diets cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets	to the contrary.	11.40604178567251

13416. some make beautiful chairs cabinets chests doll	houses etc.	9.540010636185212
13417. perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried	to see what you could do with a hunk of wood?	7.554130897202396
13418.  outside of cutting your	fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again	you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.	11.022273938198975
13419. some women get	a real thrill out of housework.	7.887745627512305
13420. they love to dust scrub polish	wax floors move the furniture around from place to place take down the	curtains put up new ones and have themselves a real ball.	8.607543850018
13421. it certainly isn't mine.	11.127230643288375
13422. i can look at furniture	in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's	where it belongs.	9.672449407503835
13423. this gives you a wide and varied choice.	14.363283156480065
13424. will it be short stories	fiction nonfiction biography poetry children's stories or even	a book if you are really ambitious?	7.596526799903054
13425.    ever since i was a	child i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing.	8.665616006873702
13426. if you do	decide to write you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips	and dejection.	13.300187004178417
13427. don't be discouraged! this is just being a normal	writer.	2.6034782993994003
13428. just let the rejection slips fall where they may and keep	on plugging and finally you will make the grade.	9.352359946699108
13429. few new writers have	their first story accepted so they tell me.	6.93103274067906
13430. but it could happen	and it may happen to you.	18.260618187660892
13431. then there's always hobbies collecting	stamps coins timetables salt and pepper shakers elephants	dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart	desires?	5.205918185291485
13432.    i can hear some of you folks protesting.	19.403685105369664
13433. you say	but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby.	13.989354989975077
13434. i haven't got that	kind of money.	9.40528265603815
13435. true! it does cost a lot of money for	most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free.	6.459764084655403
13436. how about a rock	collection or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs	and in different colors?	10.314792619043597
13437.  then take flowers.	12.150311458954658
13438. they are many and varied.	17.568020047375676
13439. also there's scrap books collecting newspaper pictures and	clippings or any items of interest to you.	5.450158893710494
13440. it's getting interested	in something that counts.	3.0888790140091396
13441. as for me i am holding in reserve	two huge puzzles to put together when time hangs	heavy on my hands.	7.6249664570848745
13442. so far the covers have never been off the	boxes.	15.026418149155306
13443. i just don't have time to do half the things i want to do now.	7.560546130154868
13444. so in closing fellow retired members i advise you to make	the most of each day enjoy each one to the n'th degree.	9.885628340518432
13445. keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life	and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to	be sunshine sweet.	6.910854676889839
13446. good luck! to one and all- good days	ahead!	n important criterion of maturity is creativity.	5.19299224086755
13447. the mature	person	is creative.	11.742111118967474
13448. what does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing	frequency these days?	11.696794769650339
13449.  when we turn to noah webster we find	him helpful as usual.	8.884273006257125
13450. to be creative is to have the ability to	cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth	an original production of human intelligence or power.	7.792021545040104
13451. we are creative	it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed.	8.680008601131206
13452. thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake building	a chicken coop or producing a book to founding a business creating	a league of nations or developing a mature character.	9.358921852526715
13453. all	living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence	the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their	own.	6.773125511202698
13454. while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors	in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true	non-instinctive and conscious creative ability.	8.05968694676239
13455. an animal bird or	insect creates either a burrow or nest or hive in unending sameness	according to specie.	5.557135687832861
13456. man's great superiority over these evolutionary	forbears is in the development of his imagination.	7.534351715904483
13457. this gives him the	power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas	and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment	in new and ever-changing forms.	6.645764969086029
13458. t has been	truly said	that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting	this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world.	8.510062764346102
13459. in our	own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne	come into actuality.	7.801009315861348
13460. the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a	poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of	1941.	9.717974961718758
13461. in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's	projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more.	7.5396455658311865
13462. it	is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image	of his creator.	15.580077382273986
13463. not only can man project his imagination	out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly	he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.	6.440215153484447
13464. we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training	can become athletes acrobats dancers musicians and artists developing	many potentialities.	8.593451042519593
13465. we know that actors can learn to portray	a wide variety of character roles.	11.079877447618179
13466. by this same combination of the	will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently	the kind of character we would like to be.	12.669321987666544
13467. we must realize with	prof charles morris in his the open self that man is the	being that can continually remake himself the artisan that is himself	the material for his own creation.	6.519433520988162
13468. o far in	history man	has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment	rather than first creating the sort of person who can make	the highest use of the things he has created.	8.916119385384016
13469. is not the present world	crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us	and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall	the tragedy.	6.876665970961796
13470. is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend	our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our	own maturing process?	9.890224634343072
13471.    sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness	of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in	being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood	under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long	period after the decline of his procreativity.	7.179354052353491
13472. some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples	are a thing of the remote victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners	are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough	from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all	the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.	7.296621745772796
13473. perhaps- but extensive	discussions with contemporary practitioners family doctors and	gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.	5.8315974655631395
13474. joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual	information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men	and women.	7.371541306761596
13475. various factors in the setting can still be of great	advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad	memory for one or both.	7.749395507015831
13476. privacy must be highly assured both in time and	place.	9.627145824644256
13477. that is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of	location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough	for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.	8.344568828020401
13478. if the wedding party lasted	late and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before	resuming the trip or making an early start the husband may forestall	tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying	in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours.	8.382409695173829
13479. the	consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long	private time for that purpose.	8.30230643254869
13480. first intercourse	for the bride brings with it the various problems connected	with virginity and the hymen.	10.010064636319026
13481. one thing should be clear to	both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur	when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act.	6.5470702938621805
13482. ignorance on this	point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding	and suspicion.	11.516601339298013
13483. the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane	that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most	female human beings who have not had sex relations.	8.60810422186797
13484. often it is thin and fragile	and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.	10.000786899163247
13485. as might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little	and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.	11.774516517947925
13486. it is also important to realize that many girls are born without	a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that the absence	of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex	relations.	10.584425345469674
13487. but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations	of the folk-lore beliefs.	12.256018107248556
13488. some hymens are so strongly developed that	they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked	loss of blood.	8.321538986369909
13489. more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not	yield to penetration.	9.311258398595513
13490. extreme cases are on record in which the	doctor	has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital	relations to be consummated.	9.471975567428023
13491. these cases for all their rarity are	so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general	population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen	is a serious problem to newly-weds.	6.1409915887878315
13492. in recent times when sexual	matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly	the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.	9.315517434512785
13493. obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new	situation.	7.804247845175687
13494. is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of	making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?	12.950203962811429
13495. 	gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride	should consult a physician before marriage.	5.7324106045367245
13496. if he foresaw any problem	because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple	procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably	to dilate it.	11.387678101909861
13497. as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was	often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for	painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.	7.781639530970832
13498. this recommendation	was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth	consummation of the sex act.	13.895519952289963
13499. the vagina is an organ capable of	remarkable contraction and dilation.	7.833301684826731
13500. this is obvious when it is remembered	that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit	the passage of the baby.	11.556325297965332
13501. the intricate system of muscles that	manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under	voluntary control.	7.056110016574096
13502. but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious	intention of the woman.	11.157978033170277
13503. that is when first penetration takes	place the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the	vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent	further pain.	7.166951064562125
13504. the advantages	of dilatation by the physician	are both physical and psychological.	9.669046686074957
13505. since it is a purely professional	situation none of the pain is associated with love-making or the	beloved.	9.06962198742471
13506. by using instruments of gradually increasing size the vagina	is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to	an object of the appropriate shape.	8.382634634034124
13507. in this process the vaginal	muscles come under better conscious control by the girl.	8.694219154260512
13508. she learns	how to relax them to accept- instead of contracting them to repel	the entering object.	7.640762110588235
13509. apart from the standard problem of	controlling the vaginal muscles other serious barriers may exist that	need special gynecological treatment.	6.711797912134203
13510. it is far better to have such	conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon	where they can create a really serious situation.	13.929523670284402
13511. when no	medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to	cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves.	7.016566968870574
13512. special	information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still	of great value.	8.095602735910127
13513. folk-lore superstition and remembered passages from	erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly	taken as scientific facts and useful hints.	4.97631766868796
13514. the importance	of loving tenderness is obvious.	11.592876029511592
13515. the long unhurried approach and	the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels.	5.989048794095029
13516. under	the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes	and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases providing an excellent	lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration.	7.090491629019095
13517. extensive	observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established	the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall	may cause	a great deal of distress in a virgin.	6.137952305732706
13518. but during the same examination	two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall	without any pain; and in	fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all	times.	8.95705989990246
13519. these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may	be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse.	6.583199131016108
13520. the husband	and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in	mind.	10.194126436540198
13521. they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too	much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at	least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer	a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.	5.803152715926543
13522. in	fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely	adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.	8.000747645302335
13523. locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing	the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.	6.632133732812469
13524. the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain	while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased	with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling	the problem once and for all.	8.112940048732764
13525. such talk is seriously in error.	9.779438006409563
13526. ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride	both physically and psychologically.	9.921305536953415
13527. the insistent forceful penetration	may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage	to the hymen.	6.730167323273922
13528. the pain and distress associated with	the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital	relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant	and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate	his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it.	7.519031022267591
13529. serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in	the honeymoon situation.	6.826762137487969
13530. the necessity for keeping alert to his bride's	hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous	desire.	7.653366111661854
13531. the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience	a premature climax.	8.005554982014994
13532. this is a very common experience and should in	no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.	12.086777346005443
13533. or the	frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of	the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him	to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period.	6.494903261980154
13534. the signals	to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to	take advantage of them.	9.964602590093216
13535. the best course is to recover his physical	excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again.	8.228481466756868
13536. this	may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding	and self-centered.	9.164781851303735
13537. he can take security from the fact that the	progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.	9.587590065741223
13538. now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride	will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him	restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they	both so eagerly desire.	7.936024710497839
13539. the accumulated information	on this point shows that first intercourse even when it is achieved	with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual	experience to a woman.	6.723276385529013
13540. too many new things are happening for it to	be a complete erotic fulfillment.	11.97232507088299
13541. only under rare circumstances	would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse.	6.912564408865054
13542. both	man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and	even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that	the wife may be cold or frigid.	10.837862974134408
13543. if the early approaches are wise	understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment	will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.	7.088869530734572
13544. writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures	titled the nude: a study in ideal form kenneth	clark declares: h the human body as a nucleus is rich in associations.	7.897690614575387
13545. h it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things	we wish to do with ourselves.	8.406876817297896
13546. perhaps this is a clue to	the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated	by the nude form.	11.550297492157368
13547. the wide divergence of reactions	is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality.	6.752904009307857
13548. differences were related to social economic and educational backgrounds.	10.473317034201964
13549. whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt	to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth	grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.	5.2648449899511185
13550. such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating	thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that	her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman	boasting an equal number of years of married life is proud of having	shared the nudist way of life- the really free natural nude	life- for most of that period.	7.4782112755486825
13551. attempts at censorship always	involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.	5.995378748041741
13552. the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude	human form as lewd	and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good	or religious or moral persons.	7.280479745521025
13553. the equally ardent proponent	of	freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the	natural honest free expression of man's spirit and the epitome	of beauty and inspiration.	5.33470516039393
13554. one is always a little surprised	to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected.	12.539401569980516
13555. i	still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic	advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life	in nudism who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution	in fine spirit.	5.362445436722631
13556. in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place	of unity and harmony.	12.46531215250249
13557. the partners each bring to it unselfish love	and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.	6.9453613629256195
13558. at its	most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly	cares.	12.018654040363115
13559. everything else is closed away.	9.80146135015097
13560. but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy	are seldom achieved.	10.189512452553172
13561. instead one partner or the other dominates the	sexual relationship.	12.146550906971262
13562. in the past it has been the husband who has been	dominant and the wife passive.	15.048489938048837
13563. but today there are signs that these	roles are being reversed.	10.931591744612918
13564. in a growing number of american homes	marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role	in sexual relationships.	11.424688432030878
13565. it is she who decides the time the place	the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act.	10.795484513832468
13566. it is she who	says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-	not the husband.	10.14825358427328
13567. the whole act is tailored to her pleasure	and not to theirs.	8.335156605051923
13568. beyond a certain point of course	no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that.	8.1412638857864
13569. but there is little	doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.	13.37755471062083
13570. of course there remain many old-fashioned marriages in	which the husband maintains his supremacy.	10.071676337218554
13571. yet even in these marriages	psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly.	7.53689360565647
13572. the	meekest most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's	or grandmother's standards.	7.981508064687446
13573. to many experts this trend was	inevitable.	10.725620681436414
13574. they consider it simply a sign of our times.	15.276164111077273
13575. our society	has emancipated the woman giving her new independence and new	authority.	6.65531711620983
13576. it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual	role.	22.41856659649301
13577. the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum	declares dr mary steichen calderone medical director of the	planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent	book release from sexual tensions.	7.662683615976206
13578. it reflects what is going	on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself.	17.75493105004081
13579. a world	in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual	relationships in which wives are more self-assertive too.	7.293288118451226
13580. yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination	of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy	and even dangerous.	10.121408709149016
13581. it can in fact wreck a marriage.	14.694553205592376
13582. when	a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires she	is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.	6.5007264939199905
13583. and she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy.	8.67828249723692
13584. on the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his self-respect	and robs him of his masculinity.	10.212259034166669
13585. he is a target of ridicule	to his wife and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-	to the outside world as well.	6.329485991123954
13586. a marriage can survive almost	any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's	maleness declares dr calderone.	7.717204296322095
13587. this opinion is supported	by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists dr maurice	e linden director of the mental health division of the philadelphia	department of public health.	5.345924785258402
13588. when the roles of	husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the	husband follower dr linden says the effects on their whole	relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous.	9.070989842063941
13589. in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office	worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband	unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded.	6.176760249531769
13590. to win her favors her	husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle	from his employer.	8.927918318968533
13591. caught at last he was sentenced to prison.	8.678047767617816
13592. while	he was in custody his wife divorced him.	9.321412991357827
13593. more typical is	the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage	counselor.	8.049736548445013
13594. this woman repeatedly complained she was too tired	for marital relations.	10.520059522648838
13595. to please her her husband assumed some of the	domestic chores.	9.32963440424557
13596. finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the	children and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations	as often as he desired them.	8.104640570750096
13597. one wife described by a	new york psychologist so dominated her husband that she actually placed	their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between	the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood	card parties.	5.582254463230202
13598. another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis.	9.368750842999635
13599. after	every money argument she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the	matter was settled in her favor.	4.720953853223683
13600. experts say the partners in	marriages like these can almost be typed.	9.523086272787346
13601. the wife is likely	to be young sophisticated smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed	a promising career for marriage.	6.50613118439498
13602. she knows the power of the	sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.	14.426206380142922
13603. the husband	is usually a well-educated professional preoccupied with his job-	often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: don't	rock the boat.	3.9876035585817897
13604. sometimes this leads to his becoming	demandingly dominant in marriage.	12.638309300917006
13605. hemmed in on the job and unable to	assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one	area.	8.881910316829435
13606. more often though he is so accustomed to submitting	to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule	at home.	12.301639211663915
13607. some psychologists in fact suggest that career-bound	husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their	wives.	5.194446997455408
13608. the wife's attempt at control these psychologists contend	is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay	as much attention to her as he does to his job.	7.919482852266894
13609. naturally no	woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative.	6.568802681037291
13610. unless her	husband also desires sex the act cannot be consummated.	9.835496792628959
13611. generally	however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wife's	mercy.	7.702301498083654
13612. the pattern says dr morton	schillinger	psychologist at new york's lincoln institute for psychotherapy	is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually	trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight	is the night.	7.137449782067495
13613. no one seriously contends of course that	the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world.	7.150420066878471
13614. after all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic	figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr schillinger	points out.	10.533334148170441
13615. there is no evidence that these milquetoasts	became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master	bedroom.	10.401625815274022
13616. furthermore dr calderone says a certain	number of docile retiring men always have been around.	8.165976409028884
13617. they aren't	frigid and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained	in all of life.	3.594282651447356
13618. they like to be dominated.	24.976843069322886
13619. one such man once	confided to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he	preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor.	7.19360942615418
13620. asked why he replied	primly: because that's no activity for a gentleman.	6.346022782789825
13621. but such cases were in the past unusual.	14.447326988396204
13622. society here and abroad	has been built around the dominating male- even the bible appears	to endorse the concept.	6.934523479634429
13623. family survival on our own western frontier	for example could quite literally depend on a man's strength	and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom	questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed.	4.685238470733552
13624. this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early	20th centuries when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring	life with father manner.	8.881270510541965
13625. in those days a wife had mighty	few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.	8.504362833420851
13626. grandma wasn't expected to like it dr marion hilliard	the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of the	'90s.	7.560500367472653
13627. wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as	used by their husbands- and history indicates they often quite	literally were.	5.837271881180201
13628. when was the turning point?	15.537164837447682
13629.  when did women	begin to assert themselves sexually?	10.641306559059721
13630. 	some date it from	woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men	in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper	and bathtub gin.	7.416477990982108
13631. virtually everyone agrees however that the trend	toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with	the postwar rush to the suburbs.	5.757335105705242
13632. left alone while her husband	was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties	normally reserved for the male.	10.042300674351498
13633. circumstances gave her almost undisputed	sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance.	4.881013792574768
13634. she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was	once considered too helpless.	10.706804195153413
13635. she liked this taste of authority and	independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up.	9.229064429012219
13636. very few wives says dr calderone who balance the checkbook	fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with	the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.	8.480530187188846
13637. a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the	sexual relationship as well.	8.179644210603614
13638. and an additional factor was	helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively	recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.	7.91957052263611
13639. marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the	importance of the female climax.	5.236295254308103
13640. they began to describe in detail the	woman's capacity for response.	9.508903654127602
13641. in fact the noted psychologist	and sex researcher dr albert ellis has declared flatly that	women are sexually superior to men.	7.397188708787073
13642. according to dr ellis	the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual	arousal than her partner.	8.612285176009413
13643. not surprisingly dr ellis says	some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.	7.219764662343762
13644. yet paradoxically according to dr maurice linden many	wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them.	9.323695168746621
13645. an aggressive	woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under.	8.384506567046342
13646. when the husband	becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness dr	linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate.	10.282383902870428
13647. often she	fails to gain sexual satisfaction.	7.993322273170769
13648. one such wife dr	linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through	a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger	man.	9.101769152233933
13649. but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until	that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity.	7.028780370353349
13650. then the	wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.	9.167287524242013
13651. in some cases however	domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered	by a passing but urgent emotional need.	8.692188615587739
13652. thus a man who is butting	a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed-	the one place he can still be champion.	9.124557397140105
13653. if his on-the-job problems work	out he may return to his old pattern.	7.534420452312237
13654. sometimes a burst of aggressiveness	will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels	age creeping up.	6.111342686857241
13655. on the other hand a husband who always has	been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking	psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.	6.8370836725519535
13656. or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered	or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted.	8.8753451198944
13657. in any case	dr calderone remarks such problems are a couple's own affair	and can't always be measured by a general yardstick.	5.461052675790577
13658. as long	as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little	difference if one or the other dominates dr calderone declares.	11.553936308517127
13659. the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment.	12.074904992721303
13660. other experts say however that if sexual domination	by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period	it is likely to shake the marriage.	10.506754390104081
13661. and just as domination today often	begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband.	7.794065575270753
13662. to get a marriage back where it belongs comments dr	schillinger of the lincoln institute the husband must take	some very basic steps.	10.250812603143753
13663. he must begin paradoxically by becoming more	selfish.	10.308949703231713
13664. he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding	and less 'understanding'.	11.124164097515118
13665. too many husbands dr	schillinger continues worry about how well they're doing	and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual	play.	6.040770630353315
13666. she gave herself a title h lady diana harrington.	11.229926535893329
13667. the new york da gave her another h the golden girl	of cafe society.	8.05331504297867
13668. houston police gave her a third less flamboyant	title h prostitute.	9.70241634484463
13669. and houston police have the final	say in the matter since she died there on september 20 1960 diane	harris graham 30 doa circumstances- unusual.	6.852747157243381
13670. early in her life she had discovered that where there were men	there was money and with the two came luxury and liquor.	11.350195114426835
13671. she was still	in the play for pay business when she died a top trollop who had	given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.	5.848256262364758
13672. she never hid the fact that she liked to play.	14.689208633571726
13673. her neighbors	in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that	the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as	the golden	girl of the mickey jelke trial.	5.004524852223102
13674. it was the trial of	oleomargarine heir minot jelke for compulsory prostitution	in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.	11.099110931227022
13675. diane was needed as a material	witness in the case and new york police searched three continents	before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel	of course.	6.521008116463843
13676. she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington	a name that made some of the gossip columns.	11.099263531812818
13677. it was when	she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation	she liked best.	9.050892750754292
13678. clad in mink and diamonds she listened to assistant	district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning	judge:   this girl is the golden girl of cafe society.	7.174639593944839
13679. in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county.	11.966951018160849
13680. in	the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign	tycoon who took her to france where she later met a very wealthy man	and toured all europe with him.	8.600090579444755
13681. at deauville she met an	egyptian by the name of pulley bey.	9.284418778853212
13682. he was the official procurer for	king farouk now in exile.	13.347093310316081
13683. she was in egypt during the revolution	and had passport difficulty.	9.966630952494853
13684. she lied in order to get it.	17.896866694811898
13685. we	have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally	back into this country h she has been acting as a prostitute.	7.158952985822713
13686. our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts	to jelke.	10.132070183290704
13687. diane sobbingly denied this to the court.	8.76665059452533
13688. i never gave that boy a cent.	14.14943914593245
13689. i am not a prostitute	and i had only one very wealthy boy friend she said.	8.588006517149509
13690. during the course of the trial jelke backed up part of that statement.	18.30233726230609
13691. diane is the type of girl jelke said who wouldn't	get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up	all your money in the middle of the floor.	6.298471990810994
13692. but she seemed to	have underestimated the number of her boy friends.	13.445111072941197
13693. she	came to new york from detroit as a teenager but with a sponsor	instead of a chaperone.	7.205911141349818
13694. as she told it he's a rich boy friend	an old guy about 60.	8.10921260948374
13695. she was mary lou brew then wide-eyed	but not naive.	6.829310190971963
13696. she had talked her boy friend into sending her	to new york to take a screen test.	11.288826996952649
13697. the screen test was never made- but diane was.	7.171654060140952
13698. she quickly	moved into cafe society possibly easing her conscience by talking	constantly of her desire to be in show business.	9.367651572145583
13699. she seemed	so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail	circuit set up a practical joke.	9.492863156153694
13700. an ex-fighter was introduced	to her in a bar as mr warfield the famous producer.	7.506621163076479
13701. the	phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.	11.281851748046911
13702. i'd love to audition for you she gushed.	5.756554997366678
13703. the	audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment.	8.440361233157248
13704. she	thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show	the eminent producer how well she could dance.	8.820950683570205
13705. after a few minutes	he said i can't use you if you dance like that.	6.280491300228547
13706. i'd like	to see you dance nude.	5.836250819866274
13707. diane loved	to dance in the nude something she was to demonstrate time and again.	7.663237334480902
13708. she developed another quaint habit.	13.239195553778009
13709. even among the fast set	in which she was moving her method for keeping an escort from departing	too early was unique.	6.988372764712907
13710. when the date would try to bid her	good-night at the door she would tell him if you go home now i'll	scream.	12.220070634776038
13711. more often than not he would bow to the inevitable.	9.59397352984878
13712. one who needed no such threats was a french financier.	12.796754653062601
13713. one of	the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel.	7.140336042976692
13714. she wanted	to go around the world but she settled for a french holiday.	13.3240012319756
13715. in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told	of spending several months with her.	7.342842312222515
13716. then she went to deauville	where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers.	13.35945532081703
13717. the greek evidently fell for her monsieur x recounted	and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he	gave her 100000 francs and led her to the roulette tables.	7.134373379560918
13718. she could do no wrong at the tables that time.	14.411203559191886
13719. and in short	order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way.	7.751515162100444
13720. smarter	than most gamblers she slipped away from the casino packed her bag	and took the night train to paris.	8.388655748463114
13721. no one ever learned what happened	to the greek.	10.866647384368385
13722. the luxury of paris' most fashionable hotel	the george 5 bored the beautifully-built blonde so she high-tailed	it to rome.	5.9405306145728325
13723. she teamed up with another beauty whose	name has been lost to history and commenced with some fiddling that	would have made nero envious.	6.462735417728853
13724. to climax her roman revels she	was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked	through its marble halls screaming for help.	8.146879057582554
13725. it was a rugged	finish for what must have been a very interesting night.	12.724184283355688
13726. discreet	italian police described it in a manner typically continental.	13.416973091835645
13727. there had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom:	miss harrington	another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and	one of your well-known american actors.	6.42817706494875
13728. the actor had had	much to drink and apparently became very violent.	10.432582266818821
13729. the hotel staff	as well as residents of the excelsior told us they saw that both ladies	were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.	6.675638159764783
13730. they were wearing nothing but their scratches.	14.036267793092128
13731. they were	asked to leave the hotel.	11.389588225276249
13732. the girls	after dressing were indignant.	12.339583965216901
13733. you can't do this to	us diane screamed.	4.906911205685318
13734. in the morning	she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally	luxurious hotel ambassador.	12.901712528325561
13735. with the ambassador as headquarters	she continued to promote good will abroad.	8.913151214556276
13736. of course her benevolence	was limited to those who could afford it but then there is a	limit to what one person can do.	14.173096197023403
13737. by this time diane was a beguiling	lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world.	8.597090283082531
13738. she thought	royal status might come her way when while she was still in rome	she met pulley bey a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt.	8.955844071324313
13739. a close friend of hers in the roman days described it this	way:   it was a strange relationship.	7.085350279045858
13740. pulley bey spoke no	english.	11.91106953364611
13741. diane spoke no italian or french.	7.87348660437762
13742. she had a hard time	making him understand that it was farouk she wished to meet.	12.58617757693726
13743. pulley	bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him the friend	continued.	6.88914902902936
13744. it seemed as though she were always auditioning.	18.82348913757913
13745. no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors the plump	pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she	waited for nine months vainly hoping to see farouk.	6.000737412614472
13746. pulley	had set her up at the semiramis hotel but she grew impatient waiting	for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the	royal pimp had no key.	7.812428831914745
13747. she picked her own middle-eastern friends	from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her.	5.6949605718266785
13748. tewfik	badrawi mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of	cairo society enjoyed her company.	7.1566929978423826
13749. so extensive became her	circle of admirers egyptian police said that her escapades	caused distrust.	6.758959179332361
13750. the roof was about ready to fall in on diane's	little world but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution	to bring it down.	9.626471608543156
13751. when farouk was overthrown police picked up	his personal pimp pulley bey.	6.944797620456225
13752. they also called upon diane with	a request for a look at her passport.	13.520498781249282
13753. the cagey pulley bey	who spoke no english had taken the passport so that diane	couldn't	leave the country without his approval.	5.558562413348477
13754. officials provided a temporary	passport good only for return to the united states.	13.731531130512444
13755. and	return to the united states she did into waiting arms- the unromantic	ones of the new york district attorney's office.	7.149623144058926
13756. held	as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey	jelke the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed	to the women's house of detention a terribly overcrowded prison.	6.3114505548595785
13757. it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk	the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a	hotel room with her meals taken at vesuvio's an excellent italian	restaurant.	7.695114932569856
13758. newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated	that she was co-operating with the district attorney.	9.189770373328168

13762. houston police got to know diane two years ago	when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.	9.08834917407331
13763. last may they said she admitted being a prostitute.	8.520002957821152
13764. the	next time the police saw her she was dead.	9.994606440564379

13767. mcclellan who had once lost his medical license	temporarily on a charge of drug addiction was with her when she died.	6.93315663833476
13768. he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had	happened during that time.	13.20085638687165
13769. when he realized she was dead he called	two lawyers and then the police.	10.491687109367525
13770. when the police arrived they	found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.	10.767514512891152
13771. the blonde's nude body was in bed a green sheet and a pink	blanket covered her.	5.901111712945894
13772. pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the	walls.	11.867445006135934
13773. an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane's	body.	8.838277577447228
13774. police theorize that a combination of dope drink and	drugs killed her.	10.40383643549328
13775. i think that maybe she wanted it this way	a vice squad cop said.	9.47240067187217
13776. a maid told us that she still bragged	about getting $50 a date.	8.564643253309065
13777. she was on the junk and they slide fast when	that happens.	9.196094583611771
13778. at least she never knew what the bottom was	like.	14.541002106799002
13779. i am a carpet salesman.	15.216994561901217
13780. i work for one of the biggest chains	of retail carpet houses in the east.	14.89971578964888
13781. we cater mostly to nice people	in the $5-8000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy	neon-lit chromium-plated suburban stores.	4.874579964719133
13782. i am selling the	stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams- wall-to-wall	carpeting.	13.070629207988585
13783. there is only one trouble with this big	beautiful dream.	18.02754090376675
13784. from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare.	13.194735477055758
13785. people come to me with confidence.	10.448195878126034
13786. they depend on my supposedly	expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.	12.87672388727154
13787. but i knowingly abuse their confidence.	12.021365521716433
13788. franklin d lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs	claire shaefer accompanied by a friend visited him in bakersfield	california several months ago as a prospective patient.	8.91899001175646
13789. doctor	lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes.	7.474302972422912
13790. then	by squeezing her foot three times he came up- presto- with a	different diagnosis with each squeeze.	6.852897849651513
13791. she had- he informed her-	kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder.	4.759690264911188
13792. that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because	he knew just the	thing for her- a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator	machine.	8.455209623103729
13793. as he applied the applicator extending from the	machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed	on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions	of mrs shaefer's body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific	mumbo-jumbo.	4.554886541106331
13794. yes the ozone from his machine would cure practically	everything he assured her.	10.01390547042932
13795. did she know he asked why the	colors of the tubes were important to people's health?	6.236357413754919
13796.  the human	body- he pointed out for example- required 33 units of blue light.	7.470415911446956
13797. for that reason he informed her the lord made the sky blue.	12.382854860950044
13798. continuing	glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her:   don't	you worry.	9.464037557806334
13799. this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body.	8.060292501292768
13800. cancer! mrs shaefer practically shrieked.	7.255580549428463
13801. you	didn't tell me i had cancer.	6.049565073663532
13802. you have it all right.	26.170465829034814
13803. but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing	to worry about.	11.416487450878705
13804. why i once used this machine to cure a woman with	97 pounds of cancer in her body.	10.591923898004485
13805. he urged her to buy one	of his machines- for $300.	7.538026508246719
13806. when she said that she didn't have the	money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office	model until she was ready to buy one.	10.07826260436008
13807. he then sold her minerals to cure	her kidney ailment a can of sage to make her look like a girl again	and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.	6.704885302238184
13808. lee renewed his pressure on mrs shaefer to buy his machine	when she visited him the next day.	9.25635432759029
13809. after another treatment with the machine	he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors	and cysts.	6.965165045908239
13810. he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would	take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money	for buying his machine.	9.659705289345922
13811. when she submitted to his treatment with	the capsules mrs shaefer felt intense pain.	7.949259955028332
13812. leaving lee's	office mrs shaefer hurried over to her family physician who treated	her for burned tissue.	7.159342134473142
13813. for several days she was ill as a result	of lee's treatment.	8.28010533895584
13814. mrs shaefer never got around to	joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30000 for his ozone	machines.	7.144599582855567
13815. for mrs shaefer- who had been given a clean bill	of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee- and her	friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection	bureau.	6.019056066483837
13816. and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the	evidence of lee's quack shenanigans gathered by the tape recorder	under her friend's clothing proved adequate in court for convicting	franklin d lee.	6.244704729139268
13817. the charge: violation of the california medical	practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling	misbranded drugs.	6.52257511710252
13818. the sentence: 360 days' confinement in the	county jail.	6.471068324387044
13819. an isolated case of quackery?	9.412288746527164
13820.  by no means.	21.202599869863636
13821. rather	it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic	devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands	of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them	away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.	6.4146295571285545
13822. the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and	ends of metals wires and radio parts.	8.4277273735809
13823. with these gadgets-	impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs ticks	and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game capitalizing	on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of	our scientific age.	4.582497828679365
13824. he milks the latest scientific advances translating	them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his	fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual	impotence and cancer.	6.810373845195403
13825. the gadget faker operates or sells his	phony machines for $5 to $10000-	anything the traffic will bear.	4.46801302401958
13826. he	may call himself a naprapath a physiotherapist an electrotherapist	a naturopath a sanipractor a medical cultist a masseur a doctor-	or what have you.	6.77206710458429
13827. not only do these quacks assume impressive	titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific	or impressive foundations-	foundations which often have little	more than a letterhead existence.	5.9841593826597785
13828. the medical device pirate	of today of course is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor	of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and	other patent medicines.	7.279393201882287
13829. his plunder is therefore far higher- running	into hundreds of millions.	5.504057976894909
13830. according to the food and drug	administration doctor ghadiali dr albert	abrams and his clique and dr wilhelm reich- to name three notorious	device quacks- succeeded respectively in distributing 10000	5000 and 2000 fake health machines.	6.5263338673341815
13831. authorities believe	that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are	still in business.	6.5669270173606344
13832. look at the sums paid by two device quack victims	in cleveland.	12.452732888579183
13833. sarah gross a dress shop proprietor paid $1020 to	a masseur and mr a a laborer paid $4200 to a chiropractor for	treatment with two fake health machines- the radioclast and	the diagnometer.	3.866600323416464
13834. multiply these figures by the millions of people	known to be conned by medical pirates annually.	8.830362204919867
13835. you will come up	with a frightening total.	14.56273857568833
13836. that's why the fda the american	medical association and the national better business	bureau have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery	to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical	charlatans annually.	6.463293402148531
13837. the postmaster general recently reported	that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices	figure prominently- are at the highest level in history.	5.264913413493426
13838. similarly	the american cancer society the arthritis and rheumatism	foundation and the bbb have each stated lately that medical	quackery is at a new high.	7.740025613036019
13839. for example the bbb has reported	it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and	10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.	7.9004222845645975
13840. authorities	hesitate to quote exact figures however believing that any	sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by	their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical	racketeer.	7.170895450285554
13841. in this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony	device quackery are conservative.	9.618178501824563
13842. the economic toll that	the device quack extracts is important of course.	10.651904390157572
13843. but it is our health-	more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern	witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.	6.870550027558895
13844. by preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate	by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care these medical	ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.	8.33664505352916
13845. typically	sarah gross and mr a both lost more than their money	as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks.	7.319934771295542
13846. sarah	gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment	by the masseur were not helping her.	8.922293066103931
13847. as a result she consulted medical	authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was	using were phony.	8.37432605149825
13848. she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be	institutionalized.	13.416621536249412
13849. mr a her fellow townsman also experienced	a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been	bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been	treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease multiple	sclerosis- and himself.	5.637833174723456
13850. mr a has recovered but he is	justifiably a bitter man.	10.518596934432543
13851. that's a lot of hard-earned money to	lose he says today.	3.237917801072529
13852. neither me nor my wife were helped by that	chiropractor's treatments.	8.643755716923144
13853. and there was the case of tom	hepker a machinist who was referred by a friend to a health machine	quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what	doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine.	7.459228084961803
13854. after	his pains got worse tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he	learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung.	8.533959138934645
13855. yes tom caught	it in time to stay alive.	9.428984957574048
13856. but he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-	thanks to this modern witch doctor.	4.946897462216744
13857. but the machine quack	can cause far more than just suffering.	11.778328704793418
13858. in such diseases as cancer	tuberculosis and heart disease early diagnosis and treatment are so	vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud's	cure-all gadget can prove fatal.	9.83357620788284
13859. moreover the diabetic patient who relies	on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake	can be committing suicide.	5.928011389114526
13860. for instance:   in chicago	some time ago mr h age 27 a diabetic since he was six stopped	using	insulin because he had bought a magic spike- a glass tube	about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small	fraction of a cent- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306	as a cure-all.	6.569564213807531
13861. hang this around your neck or attach it to other	parts of your anatomy and its rays will cure any disease you have	said the company.	5.445843204186239
13862. mr h is dead today because he followed this	advice.	12.659674188434751
13863. doris hull suffering from tuberculosis was taken	by her husband to see otis g carroll a sanipractor- a licensed	drugless healer- in spokane.	4.598509205367729
13864. carroll diagnosed mrs hull by	taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic	machine and twirling some knobs.	8.179673885785258
13865. his prescription:	hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water.	5.610249021390029
13866. although	she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him carroll permitted	her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water.	8.226344356292485
13867. inevitably mrs hull died of starvation and tuberculosis weighing	60 pounds.	6.631319314451395
13868. moreover her husband and child contracted tb	from her.	11.059904632311275
13869. in california a few years ago a ghoul	by the name of h f bell sold electric blankets as a cure	for cancer.	9.027206021463096
13870. he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric	blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died	reconditioning them and selling them at $185 each.	6.836659321449175
13871. when authorities	convicted him of practicing medicine without a license	a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of	one of his victims was not around to testify: he was dead of	cancer.	6.26069498224439
13872. by no means are these isolated cases.	13.656225469316821
13873. unfortunately	says chief postal inspector david h stephens who has prosecuted	many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of	the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the	patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up	in court.	5.704434679596222
13874. death! have no doubt about it.	8.630558494172837
13875. that's	where device quackery can lead.	5.3687393940765045
13876. the evidence shows that fake therapeutic	machines substituted for valid medical cures have hastened the	deaths of thousands.	9.054321901907512
13877. who are the victims of the device quacks?	14.364168179641728
13878. 	authorities say that oldsters are a prime target.	8.217795988211126
13879. says wallace	f jannsen director of the fda's division of public information:	quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older	people or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis rheumatism	diabetes and cancer.	4.763207079447773
13880. people who have not been able to get	relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in	by quacks.	12.849726235639505
13881. the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people like	mr a who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice	to doctor fraud's avarice.	6.203853032941562
13882. they are often ignorant as well as	underprivileged.	16.00278946701016
13883. ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome	for almost a year.	5.064724248737031
13884. his grades had gone steadily downhill and	he had stopped bringing	friends and classmates home from school.	8.035643878179028
13885. mr and mrs stewart were puzzled and concerned.	10.663312475254362
13886. then one day	dick's classmate jimmy from next door let the cat out of the	bag.	9.164363022535591
13887. the youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed dick bugs	bunny because his teeth protruded.	5.977727016993514
13888. when richard's parents	told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who	specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.	6.638061697461513
13889. during the year that followed dick co-operated whole-heartedly	with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved-	an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his	facial appearance.	6.503924663504218
13890. richard stewart is no special case.	12.038867493022938
13891. the	majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form	of orthodontic treatment says dr allan g brodie professor	and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of	illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.	7.996099264505443
13892. what do parents need to know about those years of the braces in	order not to waste a child's time and their money?	9.841282730331695
13893.  how can they	tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment?	9.231651873489225
13894.  why and when should	tooth-straightening be undertaken?	10.054246720883869
13895.  what is it likely to cost?	13.661957163962173
13896. 	occlusion is the dentist's expression	for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed.	7.195774848773217
13897. malocclusion	or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for.	7.470622701183725
13898. one main type	of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper	front teeth.	9.096466944218394
13899. a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the	face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower	jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type	of malocclusion.	6.892516667846854
13900. these two basic malformations have of course	many variations.	10.816083818837685
13901. a child probably requires some form of treatment	if he has any of the following conditions:  a noticeable	protrusion of the upper or lower jaw.	6.998377800660955
13902. crooked overlapping	twisted or widely spaced teeth.	8.673729336071373
13903. front teeth not meeting	when the back teeth close.	9.640606781440717
13904. upper teeth completely covering	the lowers when the back teeth close.	10.891040418376214
13905. the eyeteeth	beginning	to protrude like fangs.	9.082527596581548
13906. second teeth that have come in before	the first ones have fallen out making a double row.	10.059809361155612
13907. contrary	to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago when all malocclusion was	blamed on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth	irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.	7.487925672340021
13908. however this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must	necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.	8.953635061449559
13909. tooth deformity	may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking tongue-thrusting	or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that	there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking	habits.	3.331288936132364
13910. it's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and	no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two	or three years old.	5.223508134712394
13911. occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect	a youngster's teeth; but after that if thumb-sucking pressure	is frequent it will have an effect.	5.907647777631947
13912. malocclusion can also	result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long.	9.085186356812809
13913. if a child	loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward	the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent	ones and producing a jumble.	7.004068481944197
13914. if baby teeth are retained too long the	incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal	time or may have to erupt in the wrong place.	11.639882998344591
13915. every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by	their malformed teeth.	6.646914312479601
13916. some such youngsters rarely smile or they try	to speak with the mouth closed.	9.190996835690806
13917. in certain cases as in dick stewart's	a child's personality is affected.	5.861281090372156
13918. yet from the dentist's	point of view bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.	6.68983338664908
13919. bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through	a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots.	7.439412368616502
13920. this serious	condition popularly known as pyorrhea is one of the chief causes	of tooth loss in adults.	12.115156186913218
13921. then too misplaced or jammed-together	teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the	likelihood of rapid decay.	5.65401495720649
13922. for these and other reasons says dr	brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth.	11.66368054603076
13923. the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal	chewing so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden	on his digestive system.	7.444543438702053
13924. because of these chewing troubles a child may	avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.	11.391901362220834
13925. badly placed	teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping.	6.6642493545470085
13926. how of straightening	most orthodontic work is done on children	between the ages of 10 and 14 though there have been patients	as young as two and as old as 55 says dr brodie.	10.979186540051144
13927. in	the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed	yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed	teeth comparatively easy.	5.921607821152228
13928. orthodontic work is possible because teeth	are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with	an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw; they are not	anchored directly to the bone.	8.416169845853547
13929. abnormal pressure applied over a period	of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions	normally in the new position into which it has been guided.	7.370280701450141
13930. what	can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's	office?	6.570668690154931
13931.  on her first visit the orthodontist will take x rays	photographs tooth measurements and tooth prints- an impression	of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.	6.035925154883711
13932. if he decides to proceed he will custom-make for susie an appliance	consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs.	7.932061453333988
13933. this	appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure	on the bone.	6.792051068781232
13934. as the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side	of it will dissolve and new ones will form on the side from which the	tooth has moved.	9.98683333899766
13935. this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue	grows and no faster.	11.454874714875464
13936. if teeth are moved too rapidly serious	injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding	bone holding them in place explains dr brodie.	12.0745189174963
13937. moving one	or two teeth can affect the whole system and an ill-conceived plan	of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face.	4.938909310959748
13938. during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately	following each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness	but after a short time this will disappear.	11.062315615675754
13939. parents are often	concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.	7.722324859727463
13940. when	in place a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth	that is covered.	9.593605107529067
13941. next susie will enter the treatment stage	and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity	of her condition.	7.618061032419501
13942. during these visits the dentist will adjust	the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.	13.113022937391564
13943. last comes the	retention stage.	10.488578642159812
13944. susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable	new position.	7.803261691184183
13945. but because teeth sometimes may drift back to	their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in	place.	7.455598051272972
13946. usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and	stretching across the teeth.	10.104092009388685
13947. susie may wear this only at night or for	a few hours during the day.	7.771829791027785
13948. then comes the time when the last	wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive	girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.	10.195452900799438
13949. how long	will this take?	10.471703103390746
13950.  straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may	take only a few months.	10.2601173099547
13951. aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.	8.399049097270455
13952. an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three	years to correct.	9.751586647639897
13953. the charge for a	complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country.	8.734760454786125
13954. work	that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1200	in new york city or chicago.	5.369452810463339
13955. an average national figure for two	to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1000.	7.009641766226247
13956. factors	in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill	and education of the practitioner says dr brodie.	10.911295968737717
13957. to	become an orthodontist a man must first be licensed by his state as	a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training	to acquire a license as a specialist.	7.392877286986403
13958. costs may seem high	but they used to be even higher says dr brodie.	11.777922584752151
13959. fees	are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago.	9.436977516774279
13960. the	reason?	16.542242831953253
13961.  people today are aware of the value of orthodontics and	as a result there are more practitioners in the field.	9.822329778236872
13962. most	orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic	materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder	of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years.	9.5847766807579
13963. in many	cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools	will take patients at a nominal fee.	8.849820098307728
13964. some municipal agencies will	pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents.	9.701909292179014
13965. helps families	growth studies have been carried on consistently	by orthodontists.	6.753939002898689
13966. dr brodie has 30-year records of head growth	started 20 minutes after children's births.	7.168959039795745
13967. in the	past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was	scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth	formation to a large extent he says.	6.125733990294335
13968. fortunately through our	growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that	helps us know what we can do.	10.819179370694865
13969. this knowledge both modifies	and dictates diagnosis and treatment.	8.997367858609545
13970. for example a boy may inherit	a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.	10.931158219987559
13971. in the past	an orthodontist might have tried over four or five years to straighten	and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth	would never accommodate them.	6.18043812895511
13972. now a dentist can recommend extraction	immediately.	14.292909848606126
13973. in other cases in view of present-day knowledge	of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five	years before treatment.	7.071401652661043
13974. the child is kept on call and the orthodontist	watches the growth.	13.74377521130111
13975. nature often takes care of the problem	says dr brodie.	9.552325603015944
13976. a child with a certain type of head and teeth	will outgrow tooth deformity.	10.873205989805843
13977. that is why dr brodie	asks parents not to insist against their dentist's advice that their	child have orthodontic work done too early.	6.739485781184825
13978. both because of our	culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions	some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it	is wise to do so.	8.11028924825893
13979. let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start	treatment he urges.	9.105123702641823
13980. superior new material for orthodontic	work is another result of research.	9.190083428414619
13981. plastics are easier to handle	than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money.	6.428612390591998
13982. plaster of paris once utilized in making impressions of teeth has	been replaced by alginates that work quickly	and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.	7.515384288985141
13983. best	as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started	the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.	6.410186360242649
13984. after your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age	of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment	dr brodie advises.	6.373121572281221
13985. then see that your youngster	has a routine checkup once a year.	8.066101971786898
13986. to help prevent orthodontic	problems from arising your dentist can do these things:	he can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth.	7.820130300906626
13987. if	a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay-	and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out	of position become overcrowded and malformed.	4.574512398000195
13988. in turn the other teeth	are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.	11.313802576678256
13989. from time to time the medium mentions other people around him	who were on the other side and reports what they are saying.	10.084865351380337
13990. after	a while there come initials and names and he is interested to hear	some rather unusual family nicknames.	9.177443743976047
13991. as the hour progresses the	sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific	statements.	8.49996009279199
13992. there are a few prognoses of coming events.	20.326338047153715
13993. another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different	content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing	reading.	7.258329337492211
13994. some mediums speak in practical down-to-earth terms while	others may stress the spiritual.	7.296754271962408
13995. not all as a matter of fact consider	themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from	the deceased.	11.315988321054725
13996. in fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to	consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception		on this side of the veil.	9.035133498065184
13997. however that may be people are	known to go to mediums for diverse reasons.	9.720693717944073
13998. perhaps they are mourning	a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased	or seek indications for future plans.	9.421361117722608
13999. they may of course be curiosity	seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.	8.380521460397917
14000. the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation	is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated	state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions	instead of talking with a control who speaks through an	entranced sensitive.	8.416765190285997
14001. what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary	conversation.	12.12984952044838
14002. but it is not really only a conversation.	25.01340923308455
14003. many a sitter has been amazed to realize that	the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind.	7.124807018104398
14004. he himself	might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent	unspecified semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she	described it to him! most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability	to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them.	5.441480257255221
14005. however in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium	he did not receive a personal reading.	9.338079661276883
14006. instead he brought with	him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium	knew nothing.	13.021344017351256
14007. for this was to be a proxy sitting.	13.817792745282954
14008. as	was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of	this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated	from the sensitive.	9.022806312783187
14009. dr karlis osis director of research at	the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment	in a tomorrow article	.	7.331392384085626
14010. he remarked: it has been clearly established	that in a number of instances the message did not come from a	spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter.	9.221961654999204
14011. the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's esp	may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central	characters in this drama must be separated.	7.975236483762824
14012. one way to do	this is by proxy sittings wherein the person seeking a message	does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute	the proxy sitter.	9.17996889181324
14013. if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter	except his name he cannot possibly	give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions.	6.824807447346248
14014. all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking	to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal	impressions.	9.949863113938454
14015. sometimes in these experiments appointment	sittings are used.	8.049854042889699
14016. here the absent sitter makes a date	with a communicator asking him	to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for	him.	11.306998471006231
14017. in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator	nothing else.	10.413144088519363
14018. he gives this to the medium at the appointed	time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages	from the communicator.	10.47507825525727
14019. as always a tape recording or detailed	notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.	8.424832428993023
14020. so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier	between the medium's esp and the absent sitter's mind.	7.410280633419072
14021. it	is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though	research still does not know how far afield esp can range.	7.469053038429619
14022. now the original absent sitter must decide whether the	statements are meaningful to him.	10.508271872857435
14023. here again laboratory approaches	are being evolved for it is recognized how elastic these readings	can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated	in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.	6.391531961180666
14024. if you look at a reading meant for someone else you will probably	see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you	even when you were not in the picture at all! an interested sitter	may think the sensitive has made a hit describing something accurately	for him but can he really be sure that another sitter hearing	the same statement would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?	9.755673113020235
14025. 	it is of course easy to see how j will mean	uncle jack to one person and little jane to another.	6.395701109019768
14026. a journey	a	little white house a change of outlook can apply to many	people.	11.678626500687512
14027. and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform	to one's own point of view which is by nature so personal.	6.789545261213979
14028. one sitter	may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed	to him; to another it seems that nobody but his father ever	used the phrase atta boy!   to get around this quite difficult	corner there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the	distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him.	6.863468028194296
14029. if he is	not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more	readily assess each item in a larger frame: does that statement	really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life?	7.337868638547742
14030. 	or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody	and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar	experience?	7.959525005226466
14031.    conversely experimenters would consider as impressive	such statements as the following which if they turned out	to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant:   he	had four children two sets of twins.	5.789505147981581
14032. after being a lawyer for twenty-five	years he started studying for the ministry.	9.034907229477554
14033. part of his house	had been moved to the other side of the road.	18.21294655992194
14034. he died of typhoid in	1921.	15.693862693359613
14035. methods have been developed of assigning weights	to statements; that is it is known empirically that names beginning	with r are more common than those beginning with z; that	fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth; that in the united	states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox.	5.0091363109875795
14036. so each reading	can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these	weights.	10.189382849597795
14037. specific dates would be important as would double names.	8.296360202242255
14038. various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical	probabilities against which to measure the readings.	10.792410656294432
14039. in	the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment readings	are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating	sitters trying to throw light on this question of the significance	of mediumistic statements.	6.792769225303104
14040. it is very important indeed in the field	of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis	to know whether the statements are actually only those which any	intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.	9.432514006925446
14041. or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are	in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody?	8.057195514994415
14042. 	that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.	11.799675979942526
14043. so after the sitting has been held several readings at one time	are mailed and the distant sitter	must mark each little item as correct	incorrect doubtful or especially significant	.	6.025063519190283
14044. he is required to	mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.	11.927211069229509
14045. all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated by adding	up the hits and significants with the weight placed on those in the	sitter's own reading.	5.982721473214727
14046. that is if he marks as most correct a reading	not meant for him the total experimental score falls.	12.054978182192944
14047. conversely	if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more	accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for	the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.	6.748128604525202
14048. and there are some positive results though the final findings	will not be known for a long time- and then further research can	be formulated.	9.474231443307506
14049. in another approach to the same procedure the	content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium	is likely to slant her statements.	8.271431883567464
14050. does she often speak of locations	of cause of death?	12.57911075665085
14051.  does she accurately give dates ages kind	of occupation?	9.340600337123313
14052.  it is possible to find out in which categories most	of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits.	15.136209269857872
14053. now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the	items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked	to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the	sensitive is at her best.	6.415903524162396
14054. mediumistic impressions are evidently	of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses.	8.549549904533103
14055. i feel cold	the medium says or my leg aches my head is heavy.	7.408505896845877
14056. or perhaps she hears words or sounds: there's such a noise	of loud machinery or i hear a child crying or he says	we're all here and glad to see you.	5.996503055560705
14057. maybe an entire scene comes	into consciousness with action and motion or a static view: a	house under a pine tree with a little stone path going up to the door.	5.7036368605082
14058. the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively	feels emotions.	9.572964953301677
14059. sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery	and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually	there.	6.802200899786327
14060. if pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able	to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost	as if she were physically going closer.	9.456164065289403
14061. if asked how she gets	her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them-	some more vividly than others.	6.002616513953242
14062. perhaps this is not so extraordinary	after all.	21.526955112065043
14063. even in normal experience one gets impressions without	knowing exactly how- of atmosphere of one another's personalities	moods intentions.	5.5673911305282
14064. of course there is an element of training	here: these gifted people by concentration study guidance	have	learned to develop their power.	10.43665634040517
14065. simply using it increases its intensity	i was told by one sensitive.	7.159534466920209
14066. nor does a medium automatically	know how to interpret her imagery.	10.714962753156545
14067. impressions often appear in	a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value.	6.923065732426821
14068. it is apparently	by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium	has to translate these into meaning.	11.846470206733418
14069. if communication with an entity	on the other side is taking place this too may assume the form	of clairvoyant symbolism.	8.206518059532405
14070. during one reading an image appeared	of a prisoner in irons.	12.72922903927087
14071. but this did not necessarily refer to an	actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state	of mental or spiritual confinement.	6.9412708957561815
14072. in this connection it is worth	noting how names are sometimes obtained.	14.874562460059126
14073. though they are often heard	clairaudiently as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they	are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name	hill for instance.	5.615095600812624
14074. one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line	and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter.	9.472359952949938
14075. the farmer's life must be arranged	to meet the demands of crops and livestock.	6.830549665950864
14076. livestock must be	tended every day routinely.	9.99582889432928
14077. a slight change in the work schedule may	cut the production of cows or chickens.	9.062730733514844
14078. even if there are no	livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly	during the growing season.	12.387125581235058
14079. the worker who lives on a farm	cannot change jobs readily.	8.417505241643088
14080. he cannot leave the farm to take work	in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of	capital.	9.715071376069604
14081. hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part	of farm life.	6.655334540110476
14082. the farmer must get up early and at times work late	at night.	13.77164898406566
14083. frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold	rain.	7.790939665166123
14084. no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected	setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.	10.714928880181795
14085. it may	not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery	that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably.	3.7706613122404233
14086. production	may fall far below expectations.	10.50126359496556
14087. drought hail disease and insects	take their toll of crops.	6.954271352231261
14088. sickness or loss of some of the livestock	may cut into the owner's earnings even into his capital.	9.267232724042069
14089. returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good	year.	7.201155505429507
14090. the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult	to farm profitably on a part-time basis.	8.92619369038775
14091. land within commuting	distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has	subdivision possibilities.	6.289106001077736
14092. part-time farmers generally must pay higher	prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller	quantities.	4.673813586880775
14093. if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high	farm labor costs will also be high.	10.3424853372451
14094. a part-time farmer needs	unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre	as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer.	6.5872977852204775
14095. it will frequently	be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment.	10.930750380469933
14096. he	may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations	such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his	turn.	9.851231250651747
14097. there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he	is away at his off-farm job.	9.223698223577191
14098. the farm may be an additional	burden if the main job is lost.	11.853179216793604
14099. this may be true whether the farm is	owned or rented.	10.712924140023139
14100. if the farm is rented the rent must be paid.	15.208439241369403
14101. if it is owned taxes must be paid and if the place is not free	of mortgage there will be interest and	payments on the principal to take care of.	9.987540140730921

14110. the savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed.	13.079478513561288
14111. usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on	the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.	8.206158749620228

14115. for some white-collar workers it is a	welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner.	7.296407636300619
14116. labor and equipment needed	part-time farming can take comparatively	little land labor and equipment- or a great deal.	7.471760680612072
14117. it depends	on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.	12.232000696244194
14118. general	requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below.	10.741986121923597
14119. specific	requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed	on pages 8 to 14.	7.490454603360806
14120. three quarters to 1 acre of good land	is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a	small flock of chickens a cow and two pigs.	8.679430482841097
14121. you could not of course	raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.	8.258050584751789
14122. if you	want to	raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale you'll	need more land.	8.563012926041582
14123. in deciding how much land you want take into	account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.	6.801968375893041
14124. but	consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your	other work.	11.366298084068008
14125. the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in	value may influence your decision.	10.380315402150305
14126. some part-time farmers buy more	land than they need in anticipation of suburban development.	7.406013056881965
14127. this is	a highly speculative venture.	11.045689320747167
14128. sometimes a desired acreage is offered	only as part of a larger tract.	12.894182926171629
14129. when surplus land is not expensive	to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy	so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might	impair the residential value of the farm.	7.820275560071796
14130. if you have a	year-round full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your	family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of	the work or you hire help.	8.070853266781752
14131. as a rule part-time farmers hire little	help.	8.183033296055363
14132. in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor	compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with	the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.	11.371283479672798
14133. list	the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.	10.952024622062385
14134. you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have	one.	13.86103020371153
14135. do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare	time- only what you are willing to use for farm work.	7.820559737200823
14136. if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only	hand tools.	19.59761310849847
14137. you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing	however.	12.747947346621812
14138. for larger plantings you'll need some kind of power	for plowing harrowing disking and cultivating.	7.056275147119545
14139. if you have a planting	of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor	.	11.200823760233526
14140. these	tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier	soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.	9.338738111838179
14141. cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the	small-scale farmer.	8.085429507871993
14142. if you are going to farm for extra cash income on	a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments	when you choose among farm enterprises.	10.284693946795441
14143. you can keep your	machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing	the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring	someone with machinery to do certain jobs.	6.767544719140096
14144. if an expensive and specialized	piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig a combine	or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.	8.322689364456627
14145. before you look for a farm you'll need	to know the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and	whether you want to buy or rent.	7.399955463865399
14146. information on pages 8 to 14	may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.	11.581972955860898
14147. if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish	to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like	and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent	a place for a year or two before you buy.	10.028239643180974
14148. discussed below are	some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.	8.813607761672904
14149. choose a location within easy	commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.	7.367663153327214
14150. then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell	the farm.	7.8715191969208265
14151. the presence of alternative job opportunities also will	make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.	7.779160252245664
14152. nearness to	if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.	9.70717882797752
14153. if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example	you should be close to a town or city.	8.83156362658359
14154. look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.	14.750887638361384
14155. there are slums	in the country as well as in the city.	17.235575381558533
14156. few rural areas are protected	by zoning.	10.964358899578727
14157. a tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant	or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to	hurt its value.	5.916444460224212
14158. check on the schools	in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation	to and from them.	10.416764906163493
14159. find out whether fire protection sewage	system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the	locality.	7.118552315047204
14160. if these facilities are not at the door getting them may	cost more than you expect.	13.19714815949392
14161. you may have to provide them yourself or	get along without them.	12.510922631636419
14162. you cannot get along without an adequate	supply of pure water.	13.837306103352653
14163. if you are considering a part-time farm where	the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well	on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled.	6.983888874331453
14164. a pond may	provide adequate water for livestock and garden.	10.250797702039936
14165. pond water can be filtered	for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go	to so much trouble.	5.342492021086334
14166. the following amounts of water are needed per day	for livestock and domestic uses.	10.796586381652594
14167. is the land	suited to the crops you intend to raise?	10.033828433569049
14168.  if you can't tell get	help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.	7.161024381927979
14169. soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between	good crops and poor ones.	6.501833463224014
14170. small areas that aren't right for a certain	the	will the house on any part-time farm you are considering	make a satisfactory full-time residence?	5.513582110886556
14171.  how much will it cost to	do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?	9.094313256786585
14172.  if the house is not	wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating	system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements.	10.784376619553584
14173. the value of the farm to you will depend	on-  the value of	the products you can raise on it.	8.570799874763761
14174. the possibilities of selling	the property later on for suburban subdivision.	11.60017353052628
14175. decide first	what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison	with what it would cost to live in town.	10.100491590612007
14176. take into account the difference	in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and	the cost of travel to work.	8.999630138198722
14177. next estimate the value of possible	earnings of the farm.	9.907828722145782
14178. to do this set up a plan on paper for operating	the farm.	14.697308728641572
14179. list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be	expected to produce in an average year.	7.727024014289963
14180. estimate the value of the produce	at normal prices.	13.363234271825476
14181. the total is the probable gross income from farming.	11.07449058589099
14182. to find estimated net farm income subtract estimated	annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming.	10.761721261881284
14183. include	as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings	and equipment.	6.376066415255613
14184. also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be	contributed by the family.	9.907149317044057
14185. it may be hard to decide what this labor	is worth but charge something for it.	11.711673806133867
14186. otherwise you may pay too much	for the farm and get nothing for your labor.	10.44817572401274
14187. to figure the	value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated	annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get	in interest if the money were invested in some other way.	7.348068209550199
14188. everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his	day in court as in some vast collective dirge.	9.949211626732655
14189. for almost two months	the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the	grave about fathers and mothers graybeards adolescents babies starved	beaten to death strangled machine-gunned gassed burned.	5.782816953422319
14190. one	who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected	by height for the gas chambers.	9.758913614923642
14191. the gruesome humor of the nazis	was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name	of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david- nor	the gratuitous sadism of ss officers.	4.916777898802235
14192. public relations strategists	everywhere watching the reaction of the german press the liberal	press the lunatic-fringe press listening to their neighbors studying	interviews with men and women on the street cried out: too much	too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled the horrors	are losing their effect.	7.2364941714897775
14193. and still another witness one who had crawled	out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had	been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before	being shot.	7.492095893213247
14194. h   most of this testimony may have been legally	admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi	crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it	of the defendant's department of jewish affairs.	8.687167352732011
14195. counsel for the	defense however shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current	of dreadful recollections rarely raised an objection.	5.821821831792049
14196. would not the	emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming	if not exhausting effect likely to improve his client's chances?	8.564479860783662
14197. 	those who feared emotionalism at the trial showed less	understanding than dr servatius of the route by which man achieves	the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies.	5.476386384476411
14198. interruptions	came	largely from the bench which numerous times rebuked the attorney	general for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious	effort to choke off the flow.	8.24568231216015
14199. but there was a contrast even	more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem	and those in moscow and new york.	8.852158105804248
14200. in each of the last the trial	marked the beginning of a new course: in moscow the liquidation	of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin's dictatorship;	in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism	with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard.	7.611749794024973
14201. these trials were	properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was	a political act producing political consequences.	6.461955356263032
14202. but what could the	eichmann trial initiate?	16.593731358585604
14203.  of what new course could it mark the beginning?	10.185244924096933
14204. 	the eichmann case looked to the past not to the future.	10.376864999317705
14205. it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection	and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there	are jews.	9.932888740222651
14206. as such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification	by a message.	12.493079561558034
14207. it is not an individual	that is in the dock at this historical trial- said ben gurion	and not the nazi regime alone- but anti-semitism throughout	history.	6.478596227364004
14208. how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to	maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews	without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism?	9.317467366955606
14209. 	and if it was not an individual who was in the dock why	was the trial as we shall observe later all but scuttled in the	attempt to prove eichmann a fiend?	6.927543174035032
14210.  these questions touch the	root of confusion in the prosecution's case.	9.740160186857235
14211. it might be contended	of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic	feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism.	6.969403911784539
14212. but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined	by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment.	12.602463573141188
14213. in such a case	the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied	to the issue by argument.	9.399830947364519
14214. one who could be linked to anti-semitism	only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the	jew-baiter throughout the ages.	7.7426757606885825
14215. shout at eichmann though he might	the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying	the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally	recognized category of anti-semitism.	6.260554764532974
14216. yes he believed that the	jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course	typical of patriotic anti-semites; but he believed in the	jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member	of a cult speculating on the nature of things.	7.9236364247134015
14217. the real question was	how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer	to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself.	8.189369646866465
14218. in	regard to eichmann	it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained	a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism a	principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent.	7.469755097783111
14219. perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could	as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the	jews and still be their murderer.	6.490059466966265
14220. not through fear of disobeying orders	as eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar giddiness	that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained	in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler's	victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical	rightness that was able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous	the better well let's try it.	6.475143435020803
14221. at any rate the substance	of eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from	his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor	did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success	on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to	that extent.	5.543468377433078
14222. but if the trial did not expose the special	nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened	to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary	anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany	and wherever else they could find it.	8.70052407401387
14223. if anti-semitism was on trial	in jerusalem why was it not identified and with enough emphasis	to capture the notice of the world press in its connection with the	activities of eichmann's department of jewish affairs as exemplified	by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites	in germany as well as in poland czechoslovakia hungary?	5.243860270619853
14224. 	the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january	1942 to organize the material and technical means to put to death	the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe was	attended by representatives of major organs of the german state including	the reich minister of the interior the state secretary in	charge of the four year plan the reich minister of justice the	under secretary of foreign affairs.	8.763769621321678
14225. the measures for annihilation	proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation	civilian agencies of government.	7.281227662109584
14226. heydrich in opening the conference	followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order	issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as	a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the jews	from german living space through violence economic strangulation	forced emigration and evacuation.	6.9338284953930165
14227. in other words the promulgators	of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews	was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating	in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on	the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective as	a readiness for murder.	6.006287227256431
14228. this in fact it turned out to be.	25.789509169471806
14229. since	the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible once the wheels had	began to turn persons controlling german industries social institutions	and armed forces became through their anti-semitism or their	tolerance of it conscious accomplices of hitler's crimes; whether	in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.	4.6598475905255
14230. what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn	the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the	exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp	brute?	6.827146010342289
14231.  not in eichmann's anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism	of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning	of the trial.	4.698616769349102
14232. no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had	conceived their anti-semitism as an innocent dislike of jews	as do others like them today.	9.223658135904934
14233. the final solution proved that the	jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the	criminality and madness of others.	5.6162908165201975
14234. ought not an edifying trial have	made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how	representative types of mere anti-semites were drawn step by	step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings?	7.307533047996823
14235.  the prosecutor	in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-semitism	among the germans which hitler stimulated and transformed.	5.761624757795192
14236. but	if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann's	head	at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned the press	seems to have missed it.	7.9450612574738235
14237. nor did the trial devote much	attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis	both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations	and states.	5.492955632362114
14238. certainly one of the best ways of warning the	world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous	weapon.	7.977169941189664
14239. eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew	can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society	into a menace to all his neighbors.	5.75781040250519
14240. do patriots everywhere know	enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in	the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations splitting	apart individuals and groups arousing the meanest and most dishonest	impulses pulverizing trust and personal dignity and finally	forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them	partners in unspeakable crimes?	7.201616248927973
14241.  the career of eichmann made the trial	a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization: fearful	of being mistaken for a jew he seeks protection in his nazi uniform;	clinging to the enemy-jew idea he is forced to overcome habits of	politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent	to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania	and envy of those above him.	4.565719289030285
14242. is this the type of citizen you	desire?	18.67288824097656
14243.  the trial should have asked the nations.	10.710201134380803
14244. but though this	characterization in no way diminished eichmann's guilt the prosecutor	more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a	political one would have none of it.	8.980554380164289
14245. finally if the mission	of the trial was to convict anti-semitism how could it have failed	to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which	the final solution was aided by native jew-haters- ie	germany poland hungary czechoslovakia- and those in which it	met the obstacle of human solidarity- denmark holland italy bulgaria	france?	4.715778527725585
14246.  should not everyone have been awakened to it as an	outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism	proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose	citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports?	8.9973679233447
14247.  wasn't	this meaning of eichmann's experience in various countries	worth highlighting?	3.7449724276835976
14248. 	as the first collective confrontation	of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represents a recovery	of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen	years and which is still by no means complete	.	8.251173476851731
14249. only across a distance	of time could the epic accounting begin.	7.505661898694272
14250. it is already difficult to	recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to	the jews of europe.	14.319230088894344
14251. it is not that the facts of the persecution were	unavailable; most of the information elicited in jerusalem had	been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and	investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors'	accounts.	8.332675948361569
14252. in poughkeepsie n y in 1952 a roman catholic hospital	presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the	planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff.	9.081791257242187
14253. three agreed but four declined and were suspended.	7.5570233212491775
14254. after a flood of	protests they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953.	13.180857234028146
14255. the peace	of the community	was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the	incident felt uneasy.	7.336862405532964
14256. in new york city in 1958 the city's	commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide	a protestant mother with a contraceptive device.	10.580559923821099
14257. he thereby precipitated	a bitter controversy involving protestants jews and roman	catholics that continued for two months until the city's board	of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.	4.694415969414187
14258. a year	later in albany n y a roman catholic hospital barred an	orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood	association.	9.375226701730995
14259. immediately the religious groups of the city were	embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's	right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.	6.105522970309874
14260. these incidents	typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no	controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension	rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control	issue.	8.820819188629418
14261. it has flared up periodically on the front pages of	newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in	municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies.	6.508563644723004
14262. it has erupted	on the national level in the matter of including birth-control	information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries.	12.222227327120398
14263. where	it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment	like a volcano ready to explode at any moment.	6.032570619449424
14264. the	time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove	this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life	of our nation.	8.626845677164246
14265. the first step toward the goal is the establishment	of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication	on other than the polemical level.	8.945350272582095
14266. instead of emotional recrimination	loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study	of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more	serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is	reached.	9.651720082857542
14267. all too frequently points out james o'gara	managing editor of commonweal catholics run roughshod over	protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the	reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their	jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed	in recent decades.	6.1756162876180305
14268. all too often our language is unduly	harsh.	14.740263919699494
14269. the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-	frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-	already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the	over-all objectives of family planning.	4.274694733059891
14270. instead of catholics' being	obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number	of offspring as many non-catholics imagine the ideal of responsible	parenthood is stressed.	7.461948121029547
14271. family planning is encouraged so that parents	will be able to provide properly for their offspring.	7.783101450624668
14272. pope	pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from	the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the	whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as	those often mentioned in the so-called medical eugenic economic and	social indications.	9.441751085674039
14273. this means that such factors as the health	of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their	children with the necessities of life the degree of population density	of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately	be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.	8.24802056246201
14274. these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics	in family planning.	9.414819958953998
14275. the laws of many states permit birth control	only for medical reasons.	8.508937625365053
14276. the roman catholic church however	sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.	12.584379371209508
14277. catholics	protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of	family planning but disagree over the methods to be used.	7.2337696144387715
14278. the roman	catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also	known as the use of the infertile or safe period.	9.316517767285156
14279. the church considers	this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author:	it involves no frustration of nature's laws but simply an intelligent	and disciplined use of them.	5.364172913747643
14280. with the exception of the roman	catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no	moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives	allowing the couple free choice.	9.980902573245308
14281. here is a difference in	theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement.	10.699957754067166
14282. the	grounds for the church's position are scriptural	the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the	unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest	ecclesiastical authority and the natural law.	7.573308658466659
14283. the latter plays a prominent	role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive	entirely apart from scripture in determining the ethical character of	birth-prevention methods.	6.646613840544498
14284. the roman catholic natural-law tradition	regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of	the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual	love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end.	7.160913734514126
14285. this conclusion	is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason	can ascertain god's purpose in the universe and that god makes known	his purpose by certain given physical arrangements.	5.420712759194016
14286. thus	man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal	act is procreation the propagation of the race.	9.216077180941381
14287. moreover man	may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by	god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for	the control of conception.	6.327334098645406
14288. believing that god is the author of this	law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are	obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them.	8.297813223620395
14289. let	it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between	protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable.	6.903009797604024
14290. but	people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without	taking up arms against those who disagree with them.	7.896000865049632
14291. why is it	so different in regard to birth control?	10.607322956390249
14292.  it is because each side has	sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation	and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical	consequences thereof upon others.	10.96598219834569
14293. it is always a temptation	for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant	one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint	upon others.	7.894200501002083
14294. both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed	to this temptation in the past.	9.31235203334073
14295. consider what happened during	world war 1 when the protestant churches united to push the	prohibition law through congress.	8.772275635490676
14296. many of them sincerely believe	that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically	evil and sinful.	13.365692083802706
14297. with over four million american men away at war protestants	forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general	public.	7.86032941861491
14298. with the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that	the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens.	12.452516310568418
14299. the attempt	to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers	hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled	in our history.	7.317921502309426
14300. the so-called noble experiment came to an	inglorious end.	6.334452779897734
14301. that tumultuous painful and costly experience	shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced	when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.	6.3166759632565395
14302. that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control	today.	14.68121492679953
14303. up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned	by all christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary	to divine law.	8.879139391956167
14304. this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian	countries.	16.772918282788567
14305. today the roman catholic and orthodox churches	stand virtually alone in holding that conviction.	8.644712251738595
14306. the various lambeth	conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual	change that has taken place among protestants generally.	9.832806870231177
14307. in 1920 the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception	and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural	means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers-	physical moral and religious- thereby incurred and against	the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race.	5.455012939144332
14308. denouncing	the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference	declared: we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded	as the governing considerations of christian marriage.	7.912539996031035
14309. one is the	primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance	of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is	the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful	self-control.	5.722499524404172
14310. the conference called for a vigorous campaign against	the open or secret sale of contraceptives.	10.289196422943007
14311. in 1930 the lambeth	conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be	the procreation of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances	contraception might be morally legitimate.	6.753875965903964
14312. in 1958	the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by	god on parents everywhere.	10.83967830362811
14313. many other protestant denominations	preceded the anglicans in such action.	7.509409678082185
14314. in march 1931 22 out	of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified	artificial methods of birth control.	11.21926144250484
14315. as to the necessity	the committee declared for some form of effective control of the	size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control	of conception there can be no question h.	8.468523397582372
14316. there is general agreement	also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression	of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right.	10.649353905445828
14317. since then many protestant denominations have made separate	pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared	it at times to be a religious duty.	8.210409540959697
14318. what determines the morality	they state is not the means used but the motive.	12.491761554040046
14319. in	general the means that prove most effective are	considered the most ethical.	7.179216974817866
14320. this development is reflected in	the action taken in february 1961 by the general board of the	national	council of churches the largest protestant organization in the	us.	9.336955618888174
14321. the board approved and commended the use of birth-control	devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning.	8.380819769329488
14322. it	called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting	the information or availability of contraceptives.	8.48250832507859
14323. the general	board declared: most of the protestant churches hold contraception	and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are	right h.	5.992853805694624
14324. the general protestant conviction is that motives rather	than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are	limited to the prevention of conception.	9.760551845330019
14325. an action once universally	condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil	law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant	denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive	religious duty.	6.830369096396106
14326. this viewpoint has now been translated into	action by the majority of people in this country.	11.880386017438271
14327. repeated polls have	disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the	practice of birth control.	6.1477282359223135
14328. for all concerned with social-welfare	legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary	change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american	people is clear profound and far-reaching.	9.805598544310472
14329. to try to oppose the general	religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative	fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was	occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment.	7.844319424843693
14330. this brings	us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in	the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion:	they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.	9.911478934547569
14331. conscience and religion are concerned with private sin: the civil	law is concerned with public crimes.	7.379354017229358
14332. only confusion failure	and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority	the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the	possibility of sin.	9.013961203696658
14333. among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived	imposition would be religion itself.	7.5021610403502565
14334. on april 17 1610 the sturdy little three-masted bark discovery	weighed anchor in st katherine's pool london and	floated down the thames toward the sea.	7.425577160871895
14335. she carried besides her captain	a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration	of the arctic waters of north america.	5.525229376648477
14336. seventeen months later	on september 6 1611 an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery	limping eastward outside galway bay.	7.45942555224734
14337. when she reached port	she was found to have on board only eight men all near starvation.	8.242617759210141
14338. the	captain was gone and the mate was gone.	10.107062436353658
14339. the man who now commanded	her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.	10.92579651364996
14340. what disaster	struck the discovery during those seventeen months?	11.30309147819675
14341.  what happened	to the fourteen missing men?	11.69832124444999
14342.  these questions have remained	one of the great sea mysteries of all time.	11.678566655531268
14343. for hundreds of years the	evidence available consisted of the captain's fragmentary journal	a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors a note	found in a dead man's desk on board and several second-hand	reports.	5.693498809934968
14344. all told they offered a highly confused picture.	12.270287799473609
14345. but	since 1927 researchers digging into ancient court records and legal	files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information.	6.835167378565598
14346. not	enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate	picture of the events of the voyage.	10.785908764873517
14347. historians have had	two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations.	7.669419092225903
14348. first	they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma.	8.75365422858261
14349. second they believed	it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose	name is permanently stamped on our maps on american towns and counties	on a great american river and on half a million square miles	of arctic seas.	5.8272304825142065
14350. this	is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able- or	ever probably will be able- to determine:   the sailing in	the spring of 1610 was hudson's fourth in four years.	6.413576722157314
14351. each time	his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from western	europe to the far east.	6.076928863844478
14352. in 1607 and 1608 the english muscovy	company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole	or across the top of russia.	10.765077727867851
14353. twice he had failed and the muscovy	company indicated it would not back him again.	11.220956177583437
14354. in 1609 the	dutch east india company hired hudson gave him two learned geographers	fitted him out with a ship called the half moon and supplied	him with dutch sailors.	9.152361093639952
14355. this time he turned westward to the	middle atlantic coast of north america.	9.358964494272465
14356. his chief discovery was important-	the great north river- but it produced	no northwest passage.	5.713363475772468
14357. when the half moon put in at	dartmouth england in the fall of 1609 word of hudson's findings	leaked out and english interest in him revived.	7.620184520302186
14358. the government	forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship.	12.200528037226425
14359. he thereupon went	to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth.	8.220416729222388
14360. by springtime	he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage	of henry prince of wales.	8.914993658206969
14361. he had obtained and provisioned a veteran	ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one	the largest he had ever commanded.	6.461468486820822
14362. the purpose of this	fourth voyage was clear.	12.940275621870693
14363. a century of exploration had established that	a great land mass north and south america lay between europe	and	the indies.	8.50411167101405
14364. one by one the openings in the coast that promised a	passage through had been explored and discarded.	10.49829060016687
14365. in fact hudson's	sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes.	11.219713016969092
14366. but there remained one mysterious unexplored gap far to	the north.	14.042908598323033
14367. nearly twenty-five years before captain john davis had	noted as he sailed near the arctic circle a very great gulf the	water whirling and roaring as it were the meeting of tides.	5.4953671944288525
14368. he	named this opening between baffin island and labrador the furious	overfall.	7.948981650029609
14369. in 1602 george waymouth in the same little discovery that	hudson now commanded had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his	frightened men turned the ship back.	6.457117212811215
14370. hudson now proposed to sail all	the	way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.	8.315285431373834
14371. even hudson experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he	was must have had qualms as he slid down the thames.	6.5736289144828595
14372. ahead were perilous	ice-filled waters.	9.479968675704082
14373. on previous voyages it had been in precisely	such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.	9.011111238606084
14374. on the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of	novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that	he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case.	8.45272063409761
14375. on	the third voyage a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch	and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him	to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic.	6.982484979104186
14376. worse	his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before.	9.79821060631649
14377. of	only one could he be sure- young john hudson his second son.	5.079511498363219
14378. the	mate robert juet who had kept the journal on the half moon	was experienced- but he was a bitter old man ready to complain or	desert at any opportunity.	8.620606197429952
14379. philip staffe the ship's carpenter was	a good worker but perversely independent.	4.467957921952855
14380. arnold lodley and michael	perse were like the rest- lukewarm ready to swing against hudson	in a crisis.	7.599206865137751
14381. but men willing to sail at all into waters where	wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find.	6.999224993373902
14382. hudson	knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer.	13.349886319993175
14383. and	he refused to be anything else.	9.007758904049895
14384. it is believed that hudson	was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was	trained	on company ships.	12.663463730292076
14385. he was a londoner married with three sons.	11.458040236118615
14386. in 1610	hudson was probably in his early forties a good navigator a stubborn	voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.	8.567590873011124
14387. hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a	few miles down the thames.	5.3473501050723105
14388. there at the river's edge waited one henry	greene whom hudson listed as a clerk.	9.719388253245453
14389. greene was in actuality	a young ruffian from kent who had broken with his parents in	order to keep the company he preferred- pimps panders and whores.	5.460596432682763
14390. he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board	and he had greene wait at gravesend where the discovery picked	him up.	10.566300478496515
14391. for the first three weeks the ship skirted up the	east coast of great britain then turned westward.	8.88763392193365
14392. on may 11 she	reached iceland.	17.73846353091845
14393. poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the	crew called lousie bay.	6.8057338540966725
14394. the subsequent two-weeks wait made the	crew quarrelsome.	8.352828004527971
14395. with hudson looking on his protege greene picked	a fight with the ship's surgeon edward wilson.	5.352840424702345
14396. the issue was	settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining ashore determined	to catch the next fishing boat back to england.	8.411347701665461
14397. with difficulty	hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship and they sailed from iceland.	7.3776771329630515
14398. early in june the discovery passed desolation	and in mid-june entered the furious overfall.	8.333587335718626
14399. floating ice bore down from the north and west.	9.426691639570311
14400. fog hung	over the route constantly.	10.02545403598529
14401. turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.	8.062960614674079
14402. the ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic	north pole.	8.400076780909728
14403. as the bergs grew larger hudson was	forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay an inlet of the	great strait.	6.595649390574525
14404. after finding that its coasts led nowhere however he	turned north again toward the main ice-filled passageway- and the	crew at first uneasy then frightened rebelled.	6.6711962575864145
14405. the trouble	was at least partly juet's doing.	7.805579964759379
14406. for weeks he had been saying that	hudson's idea of sailing through to java was absurd.	8.939006181716131
14407. the great	crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice	of pure reason.	6.690782232702088
14408. a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would	sail no farther.	12.659605690584913
14409. instead of quelling the dissension as many	captains of the era would have done	hudson decided to be reasonable.	9.372602526673026
14410. he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which	he set up in view of the crew.	13.490287987743312
14411. patiently he explained what he knew	about their course and their objectives.	6.695246722323198
14412. when hudson had finished	the town meeting broke down into a general wordy	argument.	11.763444513203535
14413. one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety	of them to be back in england.	10.12314384594101
14414. up spoke carpenter staffe who	said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home.	7.495134858309841
14415. the meeting broke up.	12.004620095735241
14416. hudson was free to sail on.	12.021440568928027
14417. all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long	strait avoiding ice and rocky islands.	6.4679440957250245
14418. on august 3 two massive	headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before	so far as hudson knew seen by europeans.	8.092140886391933
14419. to starboard was a cape	a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands	of screaming sea birds.	6.396440501849146
14420. to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind	to a precipice of 2000 feet.	9.574449822887605
14421. hudson named the capes digges and	wolstenholme for two of his backers.	7.606829167355574
14422. hudson pointed the discovery	down the east coast of the newly discovered sea	confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the	pacific.	11.432111027013837
14423. after three weeks' swift sailing however the ship entered	an area of shallow marshes and river deltas.	6.081907113770495
14424. the	great sea to the westwards was a dead end.	10.122666088011819
14425. this must have	been hudson's blackest discovery.	7.611077007493669
14426. for he seemed to sense at once	that before him was no south sea but the solid bulk of the north	american continent.	11.517196395406033
14427. this was the bitter end and hudson seemed to	know he was destined to failure.	8.809010352485455
14428. feverishly he tried to brush	away this intuition.	10.89016717072118
14429. north and south east and west back and forth	he sailed in the land-locked bay plowing furiously forward until land	appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after	week.	6.364313569368747
14430. hundreds of miles to the north the route back to england	through the furious overfall was again filling with ice.	12.433525210385296
14431. the men were at first puzzled then angered by the aimless tacking.	8.77012505679465
14432. once more juet's complaints were the loudest.	10.091741426849339
14433. hudson's reply	was to accuse the mate of disloyalty.	4.448904925319317
14434. juet demanded that hudson prove	his charges in an open trial.	10.42609424817182
14435. the trial was held september	10.	13.392710457549702
14436. hudson presiding heard juet's defense then called for testimony	from crew members.	7.155735428721971
14437. juet had made plentiful enemies several men	stepped forward.	7.83590599705012
14438. hands on bible seaman lodley and carpenter staffe	swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords	in their cabins.	10.220425588059253
14439. cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted	bloodshed on the ship.	6.399059726476476
14440. others added that juet had wanted to turn the	ship homeward.	11.695347813364497
14441. hudson deposed juet and cut his pay.	8.694266352346194
14442. the new	mate was robert bylot talented but inexperienced.	10.13950823574525
14443. there were other	shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.	10.294714382469927
14444. the important result however was that juet and francis	clemens the deposed boatswain became hudson's sworn enemies.	8.165281724714635
14445. as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little	bay every incident lessened the crew's respect for him.	4.674818202307364
14446. once	after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather hudson ordered	the anchor raised before the sea had calmed.	8.740196188395505
14447. just as it was being	hauled inboard a sea hit the ship.	10.870117245878335
14448. michael butt and adame moore	were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.	7.6207966551846615
14449. the anchor cable would	have been lost overboard but philip staffe was on hand to sever	it with his axe.	7.020516794920122
14450. thomas douglas fifth earl of selkirk a noble humanitarian	scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands	conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river	of the north.	9.18157070588825
14451. since the land he desired lay within the great northern	empire of the hudson's bay company he purchased great blocks of	the comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies.	4.832107900430308
14452. having	achieved this end he was able to buy 116000 square miles in the	valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers.	10.000088782375446
14453. the grant which stretched	southward to lake traverse- the headwaters of the red- was	made in may 1811 and by october of that year a small group of scots	was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay.	5.493807871912753
14454. thus	at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify	the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle	of tippecanoe anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the	center of the north american continent to the west of the american	agricultural frontier.	8.006487541724873
14455. seven hundred miles south of york factory	at the forks of the red and the assiniboine twenty-three	men located a settlement in august 1812.	6.287925463316051
14456. by october the little	colony about fort douglas numbered 100.	10.275563983559923
14457. within	a few years the scots engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring	the rich soil of the valley were joined by a group called meurons.	6.6838513918349225
14458. the latter members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported	by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the	war of 1812 had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of	the war in 1815.	9.323796507786748
14459. selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go	to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect	his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the	intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire.	6.188429898812033
14460. the mercenaries	were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of	the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as	1818.	8.43514280369302
14461. it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages	of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement	southward.	9.453161348580574
14462. when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was	assessed all but fifty of the scots swiss and metis moved up	the red to the mouth of the pembina river.	10.432422075265775
14463. here they built huts and	a stockade named fort daer after selkirk's barony in scotland.	5.920929176063694
14464. the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer	to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for	food.	9.037484702941418
14465. the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move	southward by british fur traders.	6.823189926125515
14466. for many years the northwest company	had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi	river some 300 miles southeast of present-day st paul	minnesota.	9.995848563239907
14467. when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm	out of the united states its british-born employees now become american	citizens- joseph rolette joseph renville and alexis bailly-	continued in the fur business.	5.548737242282282
14468. on big stone lake near the	headwaters of the red river robert dickson superintendent of	the western indian department of canada had a trading post and planned	in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small	artillery pieces.	8.653899181328699
14469. his trading goods came from canada to the forks	of red river and from selkirk's settlement he brought them south	in carts.	5.9477404555759055
14470. these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days	of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk	colony was begun.	9.045559590755945
14471. in 1802 henry referred to our new carts as	being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as	a horse could pack.	7.866581040410852
14472. they were held together by pegs and withes and	in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.	9.702516964424072
14473. it was dickson	who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast	by way of the united states.	11.403338155220732
14474. in september 1817 at fort daer	dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of sioux	he escorted to prairie du chien.	11.239042197599998
14475. during the trip selkirk decided	that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern	united states was the best route for goods from england to reach	red river and that the united states was a better source of supply	for many goods than either canada or england.	7.206909437222256
14476. upon arriving at	baltimore selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams	secretary of state at washington inquiring about laws covering trade	with missouri and illinois territories.	7.362857178496041
14477. this traffic he	declared prophetically tho' it might be of small account at first	would increase with the progress of our settlements h.	6.231489409418499
14478. the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop	into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might	have expected.	9.62315429181093
14479. in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the	forks and in december 1819 twenty men left fort	daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien.	7.182388397809737
14480. it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three	months of labor on mackinac boats.	11.01044497418713
14481. with these completed and ice	gone from the st peter's river	their 250 bushels of wheat 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels	of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats	and rowed up the river to big stone lake across into lake traverse	and down the red.	5.184369991370793
14482. they reached fort douglas in june 1820.	13.31216385812593
14483. this	epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk 1040.	6.833672204034929
14484. nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were	forced to retreat to fort daer for food.	8.699755086625682
14485. thereafter seed and food became	more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.	8.356218622544592
14486. activity by british traders and the presence of a colony	on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send	lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post	300 miles northwest of prairie du chien until then the most advanced	united states post.	7.7437749041997765
14487. in september 1822 two companies of infantry	arrived at the mouth of the st peter's river the head of navigation	on the mississippi and began construction of fort st	anthony which upon completion was renamed in honor of its commander	colonel josiah snelling.	6.5256622060625435
14488. it was from the american outposts	that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good.	15.659386643602724
14489. hercules	l dousman fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien contracted	to supply selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle and	alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers.	4.887581178928881
14490. bailly	after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 was forced to leave	some of the cattle at the hudson's bay company's post on lake	traverse in the sieux country and reached fort garry as the	selkirk hudson's bay company center was now called late in the	fall.	5.902522675789834
14491. he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families	of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward	the united states.	6.3880178942775805
14492. observing their distressing condition colonel	snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military	reservation.	6.659945723165099
14493. as these swiss were moving from the selkirk	settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota dousman	of michilimackinac michigan and prairie du chien was traveling	to red river to open a trade in merchandise.	6.803549886464377
14494. early in 1822 he was	at fort garry offering to bring in pork flour liquor and tobacco.	9.782259384917623
14495. alexander mcdonnell governor of red river and james bird	a chief factor of the hudson's bay company ordered such sundry	articles to a value of 4500.	5.195270284024173
14496. for its part the hudson's	bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement.	10.197353316329256
14497. as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier	by terms of the agreement of 1818 the company suspected that the	pembina colony- its own post and fort daer- was on american	territory.	5.496856684207888
14498. accordingly selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move	north and by october john halkett had torn down both posts floating	the timber to the forks in rafts.	6.821185790523235
14499. i have done everything	he wrote to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment	h.	12.732945984215128
14500. despite company threats duly carried through to cut	off supplies of powder ball and thread for fishing nets about 350	persons stayed in the village.	8.099536484657621
14501. they would attempt to bring supplies	from st louis or prairie du chien at great expense as well	as danger.	8.057054565830658
14502. at fort garry some of the swiss also decided	to cast their lot with the united states and in 1823 several families	paid guides to take them to fort snelling.	11.50753028148811
14503. the disasters of 1825-1826	caused more to leave.	6.495680232476814
14504. after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice	snow fell on october 15 1825 and remained on the ground through	a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick.	8.563587993865731
14505. in april	came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until	mid-june.	7.4240890207848445
14506. on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month	trip across the plains to the mississippi.	8.931341893337295
14507. by fall 443 survivors	of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling but	most of them were sent on to galena and st louis with a few going	as far as vevay indiana a notable swiss center in the united	states.	5.907897283223111
14508. in 1837 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were	living on the reservation at fort snelling.	10.569823590192552
14509. below the fort	high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi	river.	6.751542223227189
14510. at the point where they ended another settlement grew	up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier	in 1840.	10.667901091209972
14511. its people including pierre bottineau and other american	fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry were	joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major	joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840.	5.574254541851984
14512. the resultant town platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father	galtier's mission st paul was to become an important center	of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers	who remained at red river.	8.004911228521056
14513. while population at fort	garry increased rapidly from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 economic	opportunities did not increase at a similar rate.	5.738560658088659

14607. the attitudes which the rebs and yanks took toward	each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut	of feeling from friendliness to extreme hatred.	7.084745865411871
14608. the rebs were to	a massachusetts corporal fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey	+ gunpowder put into a human frame.	8.164199552487355

14611. in a similar vein but writing	from the opposite side thomas taylor a private in the 6th alabama	volunteers in a letter to his wife stated: you know that	my heart is with you but i never could have been satisfied to have staid	at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe by a set of	cowardly skunks whose motto is booty h.	6.636775543274531
14612. the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion	to the popularity of nationalism in america.	11.66181773301172
14613. and the emphasis on nationalism	in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence	across the world.	10.999652283870146
14614. thus if we are to observe american folklore	in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships	between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset.	12.6601018670219
14615. historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism	every age rewrites the events	of its history in terms of what should have been creating legends	about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary	actions.	6.459261893532837
14616. what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important	as a country	superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches	its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.	8.580378535360216
14617. its folklore	and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account	for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to	become a cohesive force for national identification.	6.173953985572561
14618. one can apply	these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries	as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be	applied again to the united states in more recent years.	12.078713741954344
14619. the popularity	of local color literature before the spanish-american war the	steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the	frontier west in our mass media are cases in point.	5.565170367941671
14620. nor is it an accident	that baseball growing into the national game in the last 75 years	has become a microcosm of american life that learned societies such	as the american folklore society and the american historical	association were founded in the 1880s or that courses in american literature	american civilization american anything have swept our school	and college curricula.	8.60449478578801
14621. of course nationalism has really	outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours and its	continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the	twentieth-century	united states.	6.310916399881114
14622. yet nationalism has lost few of its	charms for the historian writer or man in the street.	10.04650177338353
14623. it is an understandable	paradox that most american history and most american literature	is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic	point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion	over palm and pine.	7.8812922062942254
14624. after all the average american as he lies and	waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain	hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or	her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental	actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.	8.745197853001233
14625. anyone's identification with an international struggle whether	warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense	emotional involvement.	5.073191024227263
14626. such identification comes for each group in each	crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate	national heroes.	8.447527646216452
14627. in america such self-deception has served	a particularly useful purpose.	6.726043637137287
14628. a heterogeneous people have needed it	to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and	ever-changing	land.	9.879916859649796
14629. but we must never forget most of the appropriate	heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs	almost always with conscious aims and ends.	7.216016290858214
14630. parson weems's george	washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of	the uniting states.	7.597483200700175
14631. abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of	the national constitution.	6.510417214440966
14632. robert e lee represented the dignity	needed by a rebelling confederacy.	9.000079010437936
14633. and their roles are paralleled by	those of patrick henry nathan hale andrew jackson davy crockett	theodore roosevelt and many many more.	5.915875380924687
14634. therefore the	scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years	most of the legends that are created	to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are	the concept that an american national	folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.	7.504700778964227
14635. folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group	of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission.	6.630368353669302
14636. it	has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions	rhymes and such literary forms of expression.	7.731868708761873
14637. related to	written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written	form it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral	existence.	5.403304622097368
14638. though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies	it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.	11.225040431727416
14639. in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our	folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as	this.	6.90685526942466
14640. enthusiastically americans have swept subliterary and bogus	materials like paul bunyan tales abe lincoln anecdotes and labor	union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition.	7.149482235573926
14641. nor	have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of	isolated and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did	not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education	and industrialization	had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as	a means of carrying culturally significant material.	5.649125077720969
14642. naturally	such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make	money or fan patriotism by means of folklore.	9.360921218318127
14643. that much of what he	calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people	with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction	to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant.	6.855120980956365
14644. as long	as his material is americana can in some way be ascribed to the masses	and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied.	10.023042653401012
14645. from all this we can now see that two streams of development	run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore.	7.548372367781736
14646. on	the one side we have the university professors and their students trained	in teutonic methods of research who have sought out collected	and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic	regional and occupational groups that make up this nation.	10.08093270630293
14647. on the other	we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been	willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material	willy-nilly.	6.038625552540578
14648. unfortunately few of the artists	who have used american folklore	since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams	even in the most general of ways.	9.545562594604077
14649. after all the field is large difficult	to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates.	8.621739491786121
14650. in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many	heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of	print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and changing society.	8.81514997281628
14651. the problems confuse even the experts.	9.888004859436396
14652. for that matter	the experts themselves are a mixed breed.	12.9453089468679
14653. anthropologists housewives	historians and such by profession they approach their discipline	as amateurs collectors commercial propagandists analysts or some combination	of the four.	5.205284796767733
14654. they have widely varying backgrounds and aims.	15.60227568741931
14655. they have little esprit de corps.	12.315907239663328
14656. the outlook for the	amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local	history or for the picturesque.	11.16220248489702
14657. his love of folklore has romanticism	in it and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.	4.422258901219841
14658. folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain	as such.	10.552489961158141
14659. the amateur is closely related to the collector who is	actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.	9.74237949313901
14660. the collector	enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the	very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game; and	only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has	located.	7.290676895570449
14661. fundamentally both these types the amateur and the collector	are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between	real folklore and bogus material.	5.756783258194987
14662. but there are also the commercial	propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money the other	by nineteenth-century german scholarship.	9.382301529459072
14663. both are primarily concerned	with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector	has found.	8.8574047660358
14664. both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond	the sewage system and the electric light lines.	10.019242742888617
14665. the commercial propagandist	who can't afford to be critical gets along well with the	amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the analyst's	toes by refusing to keep his material genuine.	5.0082786130793995
14666. his standards are	of course completely foreign to those of the analyst.	12.195591249767782
14667. to both the amateur	and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul lacks appreciation	with his endless probings and classifications.	6.958103548692973
14668. dominated by	the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks	down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although	he cannot deny his debt to the collector.	9.268988582186594
14669. the knowledge that	most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial	propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors.	7.184719746119145
14670. the work	done by the analysts the men who really know what folklore is all about	has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort	and reaches a limited learned audience.	9.110214110747433
14671. publishers want books that	will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to	ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint	but moral material.	5.578946665289591
14672. the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit	in.	14.76977294778933
14673. as a result most people don't have more than a vague idea what	folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming moral	legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown	in here and there.	5.408797622604898
14674. and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur	and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the	hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment	and nationalism alone.	9.441571393977824
14675. if one wishes to discuss a literary	figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize	is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american	public.	8.737606427547991
14676. and while every writer must be dealt with as a special	case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions	about each.	9.725166725560438
14677. does the writer know the difference between an ersatz	ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk?	8.445659638197263
14678.  when	the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial	effect or does he leave it pure?	8.935270036985264
14679.  is the writer propagandistic?	15.463133680286559
14680. 	is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was?	8.656743451619981
14681. 	or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american	attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they	may be?	5.332620609939762
14682.    when he gets the answers to his questions he will be	discouraged.	15.30455405368597
14683. in the first place a good many writers who are said to	use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or	tale.	9.351409189647946
14684. robert frost for instance writes about rural life in new england	but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in	his poems.	9.823645493257308
14685. this has not however prevented publishers from labeling	him a folk poet simply because he is a rural one.	8.988989663065524
14686. in the second	place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than frost	to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make	no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.	9.872903082555297
14687. stephen vincent	benet's john brown's body comes immediately to mind in this	connection as does john steinbeck's the grapes of wrath	and carl sandburg's the people yes.	3.4723201469077676
14688. the last two writers	introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union	leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of	protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass.	8.178756771019733
14689. folklore as	used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very	person using it.	7.062140857676295
14690. the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect	to nation or political attitude.	10.98719357080524
14691. in fact there is much evidence to	indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular	regional ethnic and occupational limits.	6.166067984385661
14692. nevertheless with a reading	public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness	of our expanding international interests it is easy for the benets	to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of	americana real or fake and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs	to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform	into the minds of the folk.	9.810422516635448
14693. as part of the same arrangement torrio had in the spirit of peace	and good will and in exchange for armed support in the april election	campaign bestowed upon o'banion a third share in the hawthorne	smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade.	8.428397815480198
14694. the coalition	was to prove inadvisable.	12.934414432636201
14695. o'banion was a complex and frightening	man whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour	into others'.	4.619412008265076
14696. he had a round frank irish face creased in a	jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets	into someone's body.	9.242169895438034
14697. he carried three guns- one in the right	trouser pocket one under his left armpit one in the left outside coat	pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands.	5.627413901400293
14698. he killed accurately	freely and dispassionately.	14.073655250035918
14699. the police credited him with twenty-five	murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.	7.744582922724197
14700. like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol.	10.935430208072434
14701. he was an expert	florist tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths.	8.294044754277287
14702. he had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity	into right guys and wrong guys and the wrong ones he	was always willing to kill and trample under.	8.449374689127364
14703. he had what was described	by a psychologist as a sunny brutality.	9.25565053534723
14704. he walked with a heavy	list to the right as that leg was four inches shorter than the other	but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.	9.240130293056493
14705. landesco	thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was	in fact with his aggression and hostility and nerveless indifference	to risking or administering pain a casebook psychopath.	5.39284611470801
14706. he was also	at this time although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets	as torrio and capone the most powerful and most dangerous mob	leader in the chicago underworld the roughneck king.	8.984468126841149
14707. o'banion	was born in poverty the son of an immigrant irish plasterer	in the north side's little hell close by the sicilian quarter	and death corner.	4.749233603806257
14708. he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral	and also served as an acolyte to father o'brien.	10.598106406727203
14709. the influence	of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested slum tenements	among the bawdy houses honkytonks and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;	he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and	went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving police-dodging	and housebreaking.	4.770100375853419
14710. at the age of ten when he was working as	a newsboy in the loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted	in his permanently shortened leg.	10.287880355808582
14711. because of this he was known as	gimpy	.	15.972399937865253
14712. in his teens o'banion was enrolled in the vicious	market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern's	cafe a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street where	befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing	waiters before being thrown out.	6.513064040584962
14713. he then got a job with the chicago	herald-examiner as a circulation slugger a rough fighter	employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon	by rival vendors.	5.743982166478504
14714. he was also at the same time gaining practical	experience as a safe breaker and highwayman and learning how to shoot	to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary later	committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac but whose eyes	misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish	mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.	7.736048677707912
14715. o'banion's first conflict	with the police came in 1909 at seventeen when he was committed	to bridewell prison for three months for burglary; two years	later he served another three months for assault.	4.881695422595616
14716. those were his only	interludes behind bars although he collected four more charges on his	police record in 1921 and 1922 three for burglary and one for robbery.	8.648642925246175
14717. but by now o'banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.	7.732452468795829
14718. on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10000 bond was	furnished by an alderman and the charge was nolle prossed.	8.76824080122478
14719. on one	of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant	john j ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour	office safe in the postal telegraph building; the jury wanted	better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of $30000	in bribes it was estimated.	5.46925520611713
14720. as promptly as torrio o'banion jumped	into bootlegging.	9.08544105076624
14721. he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous	violence than the sicilians but he had his huge north side	portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.	8.404303202142927
14722. unlike the	sicilians he additionally conducted holdups robberies and safe-cracking	expeditions and refused to touch prostitution.	7.1936291159894745
14723. he was also personally	active in ward politics and by 1924 o'banion had acquired	sufficient political might to be able to state: i always deliver	my borough as per requirements.	5.446575270720561
14724. but whose requirements?	20.401047956458438
14725. 	until 1924 o'banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had	kept his north side domain solidly democratic.	4.023480357542903
14726. there was a question-and-answer	gag that went around at that time: q who'll	carry the forty-second and forty-third wards?	6.920085994633772
14727.  a o'banion	in his pistol pocket.	6.454924867881637
14728. but as november 1924 drew close the democratic	hierarchy	was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o'banion	was being wooed by the opposition and was meeting and conferring	with important republicans.	7.589954788308047
14729. to forestall any change of allegiance	the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o'banion	as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where	his loyalties lay.	5.668613708187137
14730. the reception was held in a private dining	room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west.	9.8231520443205
14731. it was an interesting	fraternisation of ex-convicts union racketeers ward heelers	sold-out officials and gunmen.	6.284354956569501
14732. the guest list is in itself a little	parable of the state of american civic life at this time.	11.935069323425155
14733. it included	the top o'banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes.	7.061452315754199
14734. when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes	for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department	by consorting with these felons and fixers.	8.59272009692307
14735. hughes said that he had	understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o'connor the	proprieter of a loop gambling house.	7.34548086847644
14736. but when i arrived and recognised	a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective	bureau basement half a dozen times i knew i had been framed and	withdrew almost at once.	9.418935319643982
14737. in fact o'connor was honoured	during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.	6.123443753884128
14738. there was a brief interruption while one of o'banion's men	jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering	him for a tip.	9.265670122584785
14739. then o'banion was presented with a platinum	watch set with rubies and diamonds.	5.507570935592308
14740. this dinner was the start	of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians	which prior to 1924 says pasley had been maintained with	more or less stealth but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious	gatherings denounced by a clergyman as belshazzar feasts	at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters	openly in the big downtown hotels.	7.222228568024309
14741. pasley continued: they	became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the	moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments	in 1928-29.	6.122373583018739
14742. however this inaugural feast did its sponsors	no good whatever.	11.016012657688053
14743. o'banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes	to his loyalty and proceeded with the bigger and better republican	deal.	4.765201705475692
14744. on election day- november 4- he energetically marshalled	his force of bludgeon men bribers and experts in forging repeat	votes.	6.931843505419973
14745. the result was a landslide for the republican candidates.	11.543084886295238
14746. this further demonstration of o'banion's ballooning power	did not please torrio and capone.	7.381204730050275
14747. in the past year there had been	too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement	for their liking.	7.497175629507894
14748. he behaved publicly with a cocky swaggering truculence	that offended their vulpine latin minds and behaved towards	them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath	their blandness.	6.954823000092507
14749. they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as	when his bodyguard yankee schwartz complained that he had been snubbed	by dave miller a prize-fight referee chieftain of a jewish	gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation who were hirschey	a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o'banion	frank a policeman and max the youngest.	4.413174673670747
14750. to settle this	slight o'banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop	where he had learned dave miller was attending the opening of	a musical comedy.	7.521605059234817
14751. at the end of the performance dave and max came	out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed	first nighters.	9.263723345903209
14752. o'banion drew his guns and fired at dave severely	wounding him in the stomach.	7.015190525968662
14753. a second bullet ricocheted off max's	belt buckle leaving him unhurt but in some distress.	6.1209740045803605
14754. o'banion	tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither	prosecuted nor even arrested.	6.426052204810743
14755. that sort of braggadocio for that sort	of reason in the view of torrio and capone was a nonsense.	9.828544485555435
14756. a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was	when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street	and demanded $300 to let it through.	8.016285279332692
14757. one of the beer-runners telephoned	o'banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and	reported the situation.	6.366912159584272
14758. o'banion's reaction was: three hundred	dollars! to them bums?	3.622759735758006
14759.  why i can get them knocked off for	half that much.	8.994074549948563
14760. upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle	squads to prevent trouble if o'banion should send his gunmen out	to deal with the hijacking policemen.	7.926965273912714
14761. but in the meantime the beer-runner	unhappy with this solution telephoned torrio and returned to	o'banion with the message: say dionie i just been talking	to johnny and he said to let them cops have the three hundred.	6.267148510684936
14762. he	says he don't want no trouble.	5.448490744735808
14763. but torrio and capone had	graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman.	8.908379722913343
14764. for three years	since the liquor territorial conference torrio had with his elastic	patience and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent	warfare and disaster to business tolerated o'banion's impudent	double-crossing.	8.01609417965951
14765. they had suffered in sulky silence the sight of	his sharp practice in cicero.	7.684566584259516
14766. when as a diplomatic gesture	of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election	torrio had given o'banion a slice of cicero the profits from	that district had been $20000 a month.	7.030621552378567
14767. in six months o'banion had	boosted the profits to $100000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure	to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the	suburb.	4.13958028341562
14768. these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies	from the sheldon saltis-mcerlane and druggan-lake gangs	and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons;	once again o'banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation	of ill will.	5.306820443262243
14769. the revenue from o'banion's cicero territory	went up still higher until the yield was more than the torrio-capone	takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago's south and	west sides.	5.115187654688827
14770. but he still showed no intention of sharing with the	syndicate.	15.020840389789432
14771. at last even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still	and he tentatively suggested that o'banion should take a percentage	in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer	concession.	6.139280303413911
14772. o'banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.	5.887732511972924
14773. still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o'banion	gang's seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car	load of canadian whisky worth $100000 and by one of the biggest	coups of the prohibition era- the sibley warehouse robbery	which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation.	4.520890316344225
14774. here was	stored $1000000 worth of bonded whisky.	8.561270205303764
14775. these 1750 cases were carted	off in a one-night operation by the o'banion men who left in	their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.	4.833991829007316
14776. a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake	or a volcanic eruption.	9.45458280479615
14777. the most infamous of all was launched by the	explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the pacific	at 300 miles an hour devastated the coasts of java and sumatra	with waves 100 to 130 feet high and pounded the shore as far away	as san francisco.	6.2012497958988115
14778. the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic	inundations by huge waves.	9.497627432871733
14779. whether or not plato's tale of	the lost continent of atlantis is true skeptics concede that the myth	may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times.	5.716787520617879
14780. indeed	a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea	in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists	in the biblical story of the flood.	8.412293715405475
14781. one of the most damaging	tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november	1 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away	as the english coast.	7.52321343236148
14782. tsunami are rare however in the atlantic	ocean; they are far more common in the pacific.	9.981964735792568
14783. japan has had 15	destructive ones since 1596.	7.613826247313708
14784. the hawaiian	islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.	10.32015839329449
14785. in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled	into the inland sea; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and	boats in osaka bay.	5.4318866119026366
14786. a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869	washed away an entire town leaving only two forlorn trees	standing where the community had been.	8.555064088828955
14787. in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed	27000 people and swept away 10000 homes.	8.108204737336102
14788. the dimensions	of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement.	9.745649377195113
14789. an ordinary	sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to	crest- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1000 feet in the	pacific.	6.3153270778501955
14790. but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes	as much as 600 miles from crest to crest.	10.939251590425213
14791. while a wind wave never	travels at more than 60 miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in	the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour.	8.63064707883087
14792. the greater	the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave;	lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of	the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.	9.282435662841348
14793. in	the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles	per hour.	7.713136704700489
14794. tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length	that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.	9.694654146104291
14795. their amplitude	sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest.	7.606448945861567
14796. usually it	is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build	up to their terrifying heights.	10.522047041398421
14797. on the fateful day in 1896 when the	great waves approached japan fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells.	7.15599018011784
14798. not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea	strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what	had happened.	11.817832048334202
14799. the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water	from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers drowning	thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.	6.112291009192316
14800. the	giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones.	8.664837294167237
14801. they	usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they pour into	a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.	5.351061004306368
14802. generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell	not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.	9.961972084317875
14803. this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore	as the first great trough arrives.	10.000152462221036
14804. reefs are left high and dry and	the beaches are covered with stranded fish.	8.910417162572198
14805. at hilo large numbers	of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.	7.805130306041775
14806. many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives for some	minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore.	10.682298723807707
14807. after an earthquake	in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified	by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher	ground.	6.8421640585816235
14808. when a second quake came they dashed back to the beach	fearing that they might be buried under landslides.	12.358017421772924
14809. just as they reached	the shore the first huge wave crashed upon them.	8.654854849609638
14810. a tsunami	is not a single wave but a series.	10.934118315525554
14811. the waves are separated by intervals	of 15 minutes to an hour or more	and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great	wave has crashed that it is all over.	7.3529586459387835
14812. the waves may keep coming for many	hours.	12.510402499059131
14813. usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the	biggest.	10.479663082388688
14814. among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was	francis p shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography	one of the world's foremost marine geologists.	6.5009525621738495
14815. he was able to make	a detailed inspection of the waves.	12.55347665121473
14816. their onrush and retreat he reported	was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling.	8.704839033894007
14817. the	third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest.	9.098244932440418
14818. on some of the islands'	beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the	shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come.	9.384132961138386
14819. in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high.	8.130058990299892
14820. the highest waves	55 feet occurred at pololu valley.	11.354336266698855
14821. scientists and fishermen	have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon.	5.181336789763706
14822. during	a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night.	9.274123759120549
14823. the	luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the	stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris	by the turbulence of the sea.	7.033497206919892
14824. japanese fishermen have sometimes	observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have	enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers	of bottom-living diatoms raised to the surface by the disturbance.	6.4137650735006515
14825. the	waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and	battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth	of 3000 feet.	6.1552542778329205
14826. gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.	10.529576170134478
14827. the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in	hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised	by commander c k green of the coast and geodetic survey staff.	5.5622149624103985
14828. it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber	which record the rise and fall of the water surface.	12.014988001372368
14829. ordinary water	tides are disregarded.	8.656729721063883
14830. but when waves with a period of between 10 and	40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding	oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.	9.224458140095383
14831. this in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the	station that a tsunami is in progress.	8.154316787175796
14832. such equipment has been installed	at hilo midway attu and dutch harbor.	9.039460343592772
14833. the moment the alarm	goes off information is immediately forwarded to honolulu which	is the center of the warning system.	8.920274950520348
14834. this center also receives	prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the	pacific which are equipped with seismographs.	9.588358583741197
14835. its staff makes a preliminary	determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide	stations near the epicenter for a tsunami.	6.157172016891765
14836. by means of charts showing	wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is	possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival	at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific.	7.998341272913402
14837. the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger	and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps.	6.781726082773629
14838. all	of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system	and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work	smoothly.	8.436625290759585
14839. since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami	in the pacific but only one was of any consequence.	8.60051387876234
14840. on november 4	1952 an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula.	10.618977223575312
14841. at 17:07 that afternoon the shock was recorded	by the seismograph alarm in honolulu.	6.080772665826283
14842. the warning system immediately	went into action.	15.731082368271364
14843. within about an hour with the help of reports	from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quake's	epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees	east longitude.	5.927306829661652
14844. while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came	in from various points in the pacific	the hawaiian station made its calculations	and notified the military services and the police that the first big	wave would arrive at honolulu at 23:30 greenwich time.	7.92868453756687
14845. it	turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946.	9.593238760549202
14846. they hurled a	cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor knocked down telephone	lines marooned automobiles flooded lawns killed six cows.	7.758760107877056
14847. but not a single human life was lost and property damage in the hawaiian	islands did not exceed $800000.	8.923423752068592
14848. there is little doubt that the	warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.	20.257814527973547
14849. but it is	plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough.	10.508786233926108
14850. in the	vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against	building homes on exposed coasts or at least a requirement that they	be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.	10.576797015649893
14851. the key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the	same.	10.437252258284612
14852. life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the	sea to complex combinations in man.	9.043486512394445
14853. the land too is changing and	earthquakes are daily reminders of this.	7.890291492063161
14854. earthquakes result when movements	in the earth twist rocks until they break.	9.60696807358754
14855. sometimes this is accompanied	by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts	cannot be seen but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars	of earlier breaks once deeply buried.	5.394088763647884
14856. today's earthquakes are most	numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated	but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth	that has not had them.	6.931067278936853
14857. the effects of earthquakes on civilization	have been widely publicized even overemphasized.	7.854870679567834
14858. the role of	an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously	frightening but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular	disaster.	9.72793528714307
14859. superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.	6.990843520698917
14860. we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know	about the earth's interior for they send waves through the earth	which emerge with information about the materials through which they	have traveled.	8.264495724923048
14861. these waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface	a liquid core begins and that it in turn has a solid inner core.	7.815913160537369
14862. earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface	but they do not occur at greater depths.	11.394194848755951
14863. two unsolved mysteries are	based on these facts.	7.467137604527042
14864. as far down as 400 miles below the surface	the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to	twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking as rigid surface	rocks do.	9.371028429160246
14865. if earthquakes do occur at such depths why not deeper?	9.015626643527483
14866. 	knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been	applied in various fields.	7.476329885871107
14867. in the search for oil and gas we make	similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from	them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation	of these resources.	7.008663785289672
14868. we have also developed techniques for recognizing	and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the	ground which they generate.	10.653275870073708
14869. the following discussion of this subject	has been adapted from the book by	l don leet.	8.254581226686447
14870. at twelve	minutes after five on the morning of wednesday april 18 1906	san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake.	9.764331976365021
14871. a sharp tremor	was followed by a jerky roll.	8.688173430383035
14872. ireland's county limerick near the river	shannon there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which	means garden of owen.	8.220663193905308
14873. undoubtedly none of the residents realize	the influence their town has had on american military history	or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name.	7.109924679127199
14874. the cry garryowen!	bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was	the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes	sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese	in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists	in korea.	7.144245461279037
14875. garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u s cavalry	regiment the fighting seventh.	8.780255963118885
14876. today a battle	cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern army esprit de corps	has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables.	9.187990984064044
14877. but don't	tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh especially in a	saloon on saturday night.	9.007039458200799
14878. of all the thousands of men who have	served in the 7th cav perhaps no one knows its spirit better than	lieutenant colonel melbourne c chandler.	11.54018585195509
14879. wiry and burr-headed	with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals chandler	is the epitome of the old-time trooper.	4.323204524112934
14880. the truth is however that	when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he	had ever ridden	was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded	was a pencil.	9.910339162076511
14881. chandler had been commissioned in the medical	service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas	city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make	the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it.	8.383957317373753
14882. though	he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other	desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces.	8.64591821181714
14883. the	next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer	of troop h 7th cavalry in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan.	8.777377739945324
14884. outside of combat he couldn't have landed in a tougher	spot.	8.288759586255521
14885. first of all no unit likes to have a new co brought in from	the outside especially when he's an armchair trooper.	6.821857804079937
14886. second	if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him it's	on maneuvers.	9.504224168177972
14887. in combat helping your co make a fool of himself	might mean getting yourself killed.	7.031453804701033
14888. but in maneuvers with the top	brass watching him all the time it's easy.	11.547098061707143
14889. chandler understood	this and expected the worst.	8.568328114773298
14890. but his first few days with troop	h were full of surprises beginning with first sergeant robert	early.	12.21357526312764
14891. chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.	7.697978938409518
14892. instead sergeant early was quiet sharp and confident.	14.62192979595499
14893. he had	enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately	set about learning his new trade.	8.974381753363442
14894. there was no weapon early could not	take apart and reassemble blind-folded.	14.735930522409294
14895. he could lead a patrol and	he knew his paper work.	9.495518329251297
14896. further he had taken full advantage of the army's	correspondence courses.	10.635686632785557
14897. he not only knew soldiering but mathematics	history and literature as well.	8.217630865336442
14898. but for all his erudite	confidence sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold.	16.134305183679377
14899. he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh.	18.772329605293066
14900. sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky	he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united	states army.	12.727898737165916
14901. he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and	the regiment.	8.579360156618383
14902. for example it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry	under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the	battle of the little big horn.	11.70614360935621
14903. it didn't take captain	chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition	on his shoulders as commander of troop h.	7.141921994777949
14904. but what made the	load lighter was the realization that every officer non-com and trooper	was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop	and the regiment.	10.453773813964045
14905. maneuvers over the 7th returned to garrison	duty in tokyo captain chandler still with them.	6.5486805502890855
14906. it was the	7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial	palace of the emperor.	11.187330503897874
14907. but still mel chandler was not completely	convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word garryowen.	6.356353390724474
14908. the final proof was a small incident.	13.067910927920071
14909. it happened	at the st patrick's day party a big affair for a regiment which	had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains	of an irish march.	5.8646846515237465
14910. in the middle of the party chandler looked	up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above	the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen.	13.052237027482692
14911. the faces belonged	to lieutenant marvin goulding his wife and their two children.	7.719890080096809
14912. and	when the singing began it was the gouldings who sang the old irish	songs the best.	8.809248000681892
14913. though there was an occasional good-natured	chuckle about marvin goulding the jewish officer from chicago	singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange.	6.183326335290892
14914. for marvin goulding like giovanni martini the bugler boy	who carried custer's last message or margarito lopez the one-man	army on leyte was a garryowen through and through.	5.984091565370989
14915. it was no	coincidence	that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders	in the regiment.	12.45649879380026
14916. and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen.	16.637221806613272
14917. he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment.	12.085159934584036
14918. one of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook	and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the	troop.	9.677930484436818
14919. even the mess sergeant bill brown a dapper cocky transfer	from an airborne division went out on the range.	7.462946945672854
14920. the troop received	a new leader lieutenant robert m carroll fresh out of	rotc and bucking for regular army status.	8.176993625180609
14921. carroll was sharp	and military but he was up against tough competition for that ra	berth and he wanted to play it cool.	7.642189389966566
14922. so mel chandler set out to	sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold	a short time before.	11.949124226104203
14923. when the korean war began on june 25	1950 the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the	little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead	of leyte during world war 2 the 7th cavalry was not in the	best fighting condition.	8.9436360020399
14924. its entire complement of non-commissioned	officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit	and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world	war 2.	6.9775195634977525
14925. just a month after the korean war broke out	the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat.	8.834534107707368
14926. from	then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting	in korea.	10.905219086211858
14927. one night on the naktong river mel chandler	called on that fabled esprit de corps.	8.64666458734325
14928. the regiment was dug in	on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building	up a concentration of crack troops on the other side.	14.15234290565832
14929. the troopers	knew an attack was coming but they didn't know when and they	didn't know where.	4.452501947726248
14930. at 6 o'clock on the morning of august 12 they	were in doubt no longer.	10.880697352350655
14931. then it came against troop h.	12.339023671867722
14932. the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full	force of 1000 men armed with russian machine guns attacked the position	held by chandler's men.	8.689985128334195
14933. first came the	cannon fodder white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive	human battering ram.	5.319940461401802
14934. they were followed by crack north korean troops	who mounted one charge after another.	10.14869464998311
14935. they overran the 7th cav's	forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers over	piles of their own dead.	5.508623527933784
14936. another force flanked the company	and took up a position on a hill to the rear.	10.11758321878709
14937. captain chandler saw	that it was building up strength.	7.948728167601839
14938. he assembled a group of 25 men composed	of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation the company clerk supply	men cooks and drivers and led them to the hill.	9.74152411402066
14939. one of the more	seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll the young officer bucking	for the regular army.	8.972312384007953
14940. chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill	to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.	10.939387917799442
14941. then	mel chandler started up the hill.	7.378231101142172
14942. he took one step two broke	into a trot and then into a run.	11.790539526687619
14943. the first thing he knew the words garryowen!	burst from his throat.	10.695762261133853
14944. his followers shouted the old	battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran.	9.16923711261632
14945. the koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned	down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire.	8.946696856027009
14946. chandler looking to	right and left to see how his men were faring suddenly saw another figure	bounding up the hill hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry	as he ran.	8.815631631175686
14947. it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued	with the spirit of garryowen.	10.6748615669639
14948. he had formed his own task force	of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge.	11.694399676568462
14949. because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been	pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again.	9.462726642795118
14950. but an enemy	grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously.	13.339868404046971
14951. he	went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face	of	the withering enemy fire.	6.590039155229056
14952. enemy reinforcements came pouring down	seeking a soft spot.	8.721488745776371
14953. they found it at the junction between troops	h and g and prepared to counterattack.	9.367924083820437
14954. marvin goulding saw	what was happening.	10.199075315402306
14955. he turned to his platoon.	13.524579303960888
14956. goulding leaped to his feet and started forward	garryowen! on his lips his men following.	9.725053469144278
14957. but the bullets	whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding	fell dead.	8.33025188661126
14958. for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that	their lieutenant	the most popular officer in the regiment was dead.	10.545786104454237
14959. then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and cursing screaming	and hollering garryowen! they charged into the enemy like	wild men.	5.516765525902033
14960. that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant	carroll had begun.	10.509639987998302
14961. goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy	soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack.	5.952015205779659
14962. reinforcements	came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding's	platoon.	12.320545350055173
14963. the north koreans threw away their guns and fled	across the rice paddies.	7.867211361065822
14964. artillery and air strikes were called in	to kill them by the hundreds.	9.044838683266086
14965. though bob carroll seemed to have	had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived.	7.096184963092569
14966. today he is a major- in the regular army.	11.14418654501583
14967. so filled	was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was	over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.	9.444840213055844
14968. after years of digging nights and weekends he put together the	big profusely illustrated book of garryowen and glory which	is probably the most complete history of any military unit.	8.698176272455953
14969. the	battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle	cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off.	10.572014011824766
14970. for nearly	a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the	regiment.	11.061014989753073
14971. take the case of major marcus a reno who survived	the battle of the little big horn in 1876.	8.978629603597959
14972. from the enlisted	men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried	to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus	reno.	8.204866861741124
14973. many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him.	11.509312356888485
14974. but	when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice	made against him the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield	and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left	to be tortured by the sioux refused to say a harsh word against him.	9.537313469405765
14975. he was a member of the fighting seventh.	24.21276283401207
14976. although it was	at	the battle of the little horn about which more words have been	written than any other battle in american history that the 7th cavalry	first made its mark in history the regiment was ten years old by	then.	11.516230638857598
14977. brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment's	first permanent commander and like such generals as george	s patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military	prominence	custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.	4.73805847438968
14978. during	the civil war custer who achieved a brilliant record was	made	brigadier general at the age of 23.	10.135740474716037
14979. he finished the war as	a major general commanding a full division and at 25 was the youngest	major general in the history of the u s army.	10.117934426131141
14980. i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident in	the sense that everyone agrees with them.	11.924185118826927
14981. if they were walter lippmann	would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky and herblock	would have nothing to draw cartoons about.	7.163153732344891
14982. i do mean however that	i take them for granted and that everything i shall be saying	assumption	the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish	a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom	and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular-	since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions	be enjoyed by the people of the united states.	9.756594761592673
14983. i speak of the largest	possible measure because any person who supposes that these	conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons	without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human	assumption	these conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable	in the qualified sense i have indicated- without the prior defeat	of world communism.	4.931923437638157
14984. this is true for two reasons: because communism	is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions;	and because communists have the will and as long as soviet	power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization.	8.78524554048195
14985. moreover	as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions	throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of	their restoration becomes increasingly remote.	5.888660704479464
14986. it	follows that victory over communism is the dominant proximate goal	of american policy.	8.926489261455298
14987. proximate in the sense that there are more distant	more positive ends we seek to which victory over communism	is but a means.	8.647403271301
14988. but dominant in the sense that every other objective	no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it.	12.628042281371252
14989. peace is a worthy	objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the	communists out of berlin then we must fight.	6.670607344093306
14990. freedom in the sense	of self-determination is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination	to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into	the sino-soviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postponed.	5.584110384304125
14991. justice	is a worthy objective; but if justice for bantus entails driving	the government of the union of south africa away from the west	then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards	yet a while longer.	6.3133958064044435
14992. prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing	higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient	guns to resist communist aggression then material sacrifices and	denials will have to be made.	9.712359214575875
14993. it may be of course that such objectives	can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism;	my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be	resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant	world- the absence of soviet communist power.	7.084122623016015
14994. power	this much having been said the question remains whether we	have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat communism-	and if so how those resources ought to be used.	8.062879408220295
14995. this brings us squarely	to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power.	9.617973136272674
14996. i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that	it always has been that it always will be.	14.204240659146892
14997. and i suggest further	that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of	american policy-makers ever since we assumed free world leadership	in 1945 to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.	6.88296524966426
14998. in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting	the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them	into proper focus.	11.461984173228867
14999. one was demonstrably false; the other for the	most part true.	8.186077534199187
15000. the first was that america had become- or	was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power.	7.552913718279036
15001. i know i	do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention.	10.594742047818658
15002. you	may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment-	i certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all american	strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states	not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the	development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent	feature of us-soviet relations for the foreseeable future.	6.034145094078004
15003. i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority	on those americans who have doubts and i think mr jameson	campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet	myth.	7.267285548053304
15004. suppose he says that the tables were turned and we	were in the soviets' position: there would be more than 2000	modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at 250 bases	in mexico and the caribbean.	8.946073674427579
15005. overwhelming russian naval power would	always be within a few hundred miles of our coast.	7.090106468161324
15006. half of the population	of the us would be needed to work on arms just to feed	the people.	15.06797586626834
15007. add this to the unrest in the countries around us where	oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.	8.014319493317387
15008. add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would	severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the	missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.	7.630956028692023
15009. if	we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of khrushchev's	nightmarish worries- or at least of the worries he might have if	his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage.	7.079108794842444
15010. the other charge was that america's political position	in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years.	8.687300219169048
15011. the	contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it	ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to	see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.	6.811616717856179
15012. the argument was typically advanced in terms of us prestige.	12.904989000250497
15013. prestige however is only a minor part of the problem; and	even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading.	9.607763736618175
15014. prestige	is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill.	11.377480087358919
15015. but contrary	to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important	for its own sake.	7.769985648062709
15016. only the vain and incurably sentimental among	us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed	by our strength as they ought to be.	9.275350516822533
15017. the thing to lose sleep over	is what people having concluded that we are weaker than we are are	likely to do about it.	8.479206025732037
15018. the evidence suggests that foreign peoples	believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union and	is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead.	11.69420972527364
15019. this ignorant	estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes	very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically	do- namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be	the winning side.	5.4228228390316815
15020. to the extent then that declining us prestige	means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on	an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet	intimidation there is reason for concern.	9.449558749123609
15021. still these guesses	about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the	actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves.	8.656692891735085
15022. here	i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and	overwhelming but of political power- of influence if you will-	about which the relevant questions are: is soviet influence throughout	the world greater or less than it was ten years ago?	6.9940034243337506
15023.  and is western	influence greater or less than it used to be?	12.200175043331713
15024. 	in answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether	communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy	before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform	are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded:	the success of communism's war against the west does not depend	on such spectacular and definitive conquests.	7.112576769982849
15025. success may mean merely	the displacement of western influence.	7.8558621458964515
15026. communist political	warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages.	8.758374609194023
15027. fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they	could not win the communists seek to undermine western power where	the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla	skirmishes	in mob uprisings in the streets in parliaments in clandestine	meetings of undercover conspirators at the united nations	on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences- preferably at	the highest level.	5.3683053184082175
15028. the soviets understand moreover that the	first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against	the west.	9.35131588324858
15029. thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover	is to neutralize a country.	7.44424777089433
15030. the second stage is to retain the	nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turning the	country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy.	8.709621048365472
15031. and	this may be as far as the process will go.	11.066917088079245
15032. the kremlin's goal is	the isolation and capture not of ghana but of the united states-	and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade	under a neutralist mask yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries	of the soviet foreign office.	7.286431655681822
15033. to recite the particulars of	recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring.	7.297048777660095
15034. six years ago	french indochina though in troubie was in the western camp.	11.369489773517289
15035. today	northern vietnam is overtly communist; laos is teetering between	communism and pro-communist neutralism; cambodia is for all	practical purposes neutralist.	3.666345451060415
15036. indonesia in the early days of	the republic leaned toward the west.	11.873440495357766
15037. today sukarno's government	is heavily besieged by avowed communists and for all of its neutralist	pretensions it is a firm ally of soviet policy.	6.5935854474856415
15038. ceylon	has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly	hostile to the west.	6.678406059758382
15039. in the middle east iraq syria and	egypt were a short while ago in the western camp.	11.894190192813666
15040. today the nasser	and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west are dependent	for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel;	in almost every particular follow the kremlin's foreign policy line.	6.670709723457116
15041. a short time ago all africa was a western preserve.	9.040065384846425
15042. never	mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination:	the point is that in the struggle for the world that	vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west.	8.910902428161416
15043. today	africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging	it would seem into the soviet orbit.	7.513568440093626
15044. latin america was once	an area as safe for the west as nebraska was for nixon.	9.89881801815746
15045. today	it is up for grabs.	8.73313666310545
15046. one latin american country cuba has become	a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast.	9.18458979833983
15047. in some countries	the trend has gone further than others: mexico panama and venezuela	are displaying open sympathy for castroism and there is no country-	save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently	arranged- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent	the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause.	4.750675299210935
15048. only in europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the	surface.	8.972479261758105
15049. the strains of neutralism are running strong notably in	england and even in germany.	7.713337633662805
15050. what have	we to show by way of counter-successes?	14.619166360656749
15051.  we have had opportunities-	clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron	curtain.	12.341457445930457
15052. there was the hungarian revolution which we praised	and mourned but did nothing about.	15.826745120201357
15053. there was the polish revolution	which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable	to soviet interests.	8.757767611511428
15054. there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended	did not exist.	18.08013383510421
15055. only in one instance have we moved purposively	and effectively to dislodge existing communist power: in guatemala.	6.175418937356895
15056. and contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside	pressures and world opinion to bring down that communist	government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist	coup	d'etat.	9.174668303159534
15057. we served our national interests and by so doing we	saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.	7.625556787002028
15058. the first rattle of the machine guns at 7:10 in the evening	roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.	8.251584991818495
15059. sounds	exactly like last time.	8.070014265390524
15060. the young man spoke steadily enough	but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven.	12.87520357498532
15061. the middle-aged man	said over and over why did i come here why did i come	here.	8.178059728871544
15062. amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons	i heard the thumping of mortars.	8.271976054189373
15063. then the lights went out.	11.624052753328817
15064. this was my	second day in vientiane the administrative capital of	laos and my thoughts were none too brave.	9.768751451008255
15065. where was my flashlight?	12.501993520586952
15066. 	where should i go?	9.663020614307381
15067.  to my room?	14.201020484406714
15068.  better stay in the hotel lobby	where the walls looked good and thick.	10.48255141235678
15069. chinese and indian	merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters.	6.455871316213203
15070. hotel	attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby.	8.89435379177355
15071. a woman with a small	boy slipped in between them.	9.41441833994568
15072. she held out her hand to show that she had money.	14.496752438360579
15073. the american	newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office.	8.182161715663158
15074. but what	was the story?	17.07490649099903
15075.  had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this	far?	6.276988997310264
15076.  or was it another revolt inside vientiane?	11.910111577800816
15077.    let's	play hero i said.	5.6235376418532415
15078. let's go to the roof and see.	8.02767278882478
15079. saves the moon	by 7:50 the answer was plain.	5.641656686630123
15080. there had	been an eclipse of the moon.	15.375380702294617
15081. a traditional lao explanation is that	the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all	possible noise ideally with firearms.	6.4015551887230675
15082. the din was successful	too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had	begun	to spit it out again which meant good luck all around.	8.559569954097237
15083. how	quaint it all seemed the next day.	7.668833672960222
15084. a restaurant posted a reminder to	patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks.	8.911447348350157
15085. but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later.	8.110749247677909
15086. and no wonder for vientiane the old city of sandalwood had	become the city of bullet holes.	10.414489510820587
15087. i saw holes in planes at the	airport and in cars in the streets.	8.811999737650522
15088. along the main thoroughfares hardly	a house had not been peppered.	12.925691987285774
15089. in place of the police headquarters	was a new square filled with rubble.	10.192929628598353
15090. mortars had demolished the	defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door.	8.67610534655491
15091. what	had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened	brick.	5.219445099398044
15092. this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane	fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments	had ruled here in three days.	10.872980085450866
15093. and now in march	all laos suffered a state of siege.	9.984561514213237
15094. the pathet lao forces held	two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.	10.770273859886407
15095. throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush	and death.	7.091700447183202
15096. and it's all the more tragic because it's	so little deserved said mr j j a frans a belgian	official of the united nations educational scientific and cultural	organization.	6.893225080665228
15097. we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with	the u n flag.	7.333739033428924
15098. practically all the people of laos he	explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers and the means	and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel	plows.	7.2668276428030625
15099. they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes	in ten or eleven thousand villages with an average of 200 souls.	8.127839569620686
15100. nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are.	10.925361695195988
15101. they spread	over an area no larger than oregon; yet they include peoples as different	from one another as oregonians are from patagonians.	5.419759936969101
15102. must be kept in harmony	what matters here is family loyalty;	faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis the spirits;	and to live in harmony with nature.	8.040810632378383
15103. harmony in laos?	10.577664745167665
15104. 	precisely said mr frans.	9.663020614307381
15105. he spoke of the season of	dryness and dust brought by the monsoon from the northeast in harmony	with the season of rain and mud brought by the monsoon from the southwest.	9.402391966978564
15106. the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering	mekong river.	10.769229691025927
15107. shy slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with	the frangipani by the wayside.	5.630850290981954
15108. even life in harmony with death.	16.503176392031033
15109. for	so long as death was not violent it was natural and to be welcomed	making a funeral a feast.	6.847655525973459
15110. to many a frenchman- they came	95 years ago colonized and stayed until laos became independent in	1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti.	6.61702735262095
15111. yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen	around the globe.	8.319859238495459
15112. the pathet lao stiffened by communist veterans	from neighboring north viet nam were supplied by soviet aircraft.	10.376436728515262
15113. the royal lao army on the other hand was paid and equipped with	american funds.	11.314620042670967
15114. in six years u s aid had amounted to more	than $1.	12.916467717901536
15115. 60 for each american- a total of three hundred million dollars.	6.624778205034659
15116. we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened	to ignite another war among the world's giants.	14.152621771216204
15117. even if it	did not how would this little world of gentle people cope with its	new reality of grenades and submachine guns?	7.164832889416055
15118.    to find out we	traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled in	the daytime at least by the royal lao army: from attopeu the	city	of buffalo dung in the southeast to muong sing the city of	lions in the northwest close to communist china.	8.607398375403756
15119. we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil	between ruts all four wheels spinning uselessly.	6.104872474205562
15120. we flew in rickety	planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash.	7.749148104703217
15121. in the	end we ran into communist artillery fire.	9.261577236002815
15122. we were bill	garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff whose	three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any	fighting man we met; boun my our interpreter; and myself.	7.03655089046323
15123. boun my- the name means one who has a boun a celebration and	is therefore lucky- was born in savannakhet the border of paradise.	5.3538089585731345
15124. he had attended three universities in the united states.	19.171163890247925
15125. but	he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane	including the royal capital luang prabang.	7.173629804930284
15126. before the airplanes	came he said travel in laos was just about impossible.	12.558900134655548
15127. minister moves fast	alas so it almost proved for us too.	6.759965614215402
15128. to	go outside the few cities required permits.	9.825153100978396
15129. and getting them seemed	a life's work.	8.507011965144274
15130. nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured and	few soldiers could be spared as escorts.	9.027136298983283
15131. we were told that to	the pathet lao a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 a fortune	in laos.	5.961166587364189
15132. everyone had heard of the american contractor who had	spurned an escort.	12.274446336835284
15133. now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching	him barefoot from village to village as evidence of evil american	intervention.	6.586555637274918
15134. although we enjoyed our rounds of the government	offices in vientiane with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation	in french we were getting nowhere.	8.02387841637789
15135. we had nearly decided	that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true when we were invited	to take a trip with the prime minister.	6.96277954349109
15136. could we be ready in 15	minutes?	12.46363141578203
15137.  his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of	town and he was eager to be off.	8.53153271656085
15138. and	so after a flight southeast to savannakhet we found ourselves bouncing	along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun	oum of champassak a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket	and a ten-gallon hat from texas.	6.071093166963947
15139. from his shoulder bag peeked the	seven-inch barrel of a luger.	6.4550657337510655
15140. the temperature rose to 105`.	14.28182206768285
15141. with our company of soldiers we made one long column of reddish dust.	8.124957215895805
15142. in keng kok the city of silkworms the prime minister	bought fried chickens and fried cicadas and two notebooks for me.	8.295981103490565
15143. then we drove on until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice	fields bouncing across their squat earth walls.	7.709303563234097
15144. it was a	spleen-crushing day.	22.867305158924196
15145. an hour of bouncing a brief stop in a village to	inspect a new school or dispensary.	7.662946847411538
15146. more bouncing another stop a	new house for teachers a new well.	9.962101308605071
15147. then off again rushing to keep up.	10.427587652283435
15148. but our two jeep mates- keo viphakone	from luang prabang and john cool from beaver pennsylvania-	were beaming under their coatings of dust.	6.400678550641187
15149. together they had probably	done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century-	constructively.	8.88717585868446
15150. mr keo once a diplomat in paris and washington	was commissioner of rural affairs.	9.571622185536159
15151. john an engineer and anthropologist	with a doctorate from the london school of economics	headed the rural development division of usom the united states	operations mission administering us aid.	5.553817914872739
15152. what	you see are self-help projects john said.	6.73497912422216
15153. we ask the people	what they want and they supply the labor.	8.91793982842755
15154. we send shovels cement	nails	and corrugated iron for roofs.	10.964423852979365
15155. that way they have an infirmary	for $400.	12.960427718862096
15156. we have 2500 such projects and they add up to a lot more	than just roads and wells and schools.	11.962111544969371
15157. mr	keo agreed.	9.723875566280467
15158. our people have been used to accepting things as	they found them he said.	12.172293643294045
15159. where there was no road they lived	without one.	9.527965096874386
15160. now they learn that men can change their surroundings	through their traditional village elders without violence.	9.72599208097282
15161. that's	a big step toward a modern state.	5.617280120288584
15162. you might say we are in the nation-building	business.	21.784156682439285
15163. in the villages people lined up to give	us flowers.	10.399767820648098
15164. then came coconuts eggs and rice wine.	12.652864139535854
15165. the prime minister	paid his respects to the buddhist monks strode rapidly among the	houses joked with the local soldiery and made a speech.	6.503282138080614
15166. the soldiers	are fighting and the americans are helping he said but in the	fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself.	9.936560012694933
15167. then we were off again.	12.963017074304561
15168. we did it for three days.	18.856562377478483
15169. but	our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery.	6.6206844578831205
15170. crossing the 4000-foot	width of the mekong at champassak on a raft with an outboard	motor we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean	breeze.	6.8097136483034815
15171. then we hung overboard in the water.	10.336400124062903
15172. briefly we rolled	over a paved road up to pak song on the cool bolovens plateau.	8.294102328061703
15173. the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood supported	by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines and fed rice	to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song.	6.209309108018569
15174. keep souls in place	in the village of soukhouma which means	peaceful we had a baci.	9.646067202523493
15175. this is the most endearing of lao	ceremonies.	15.321432196129196
15176. it takes place in the household a rite of well-wishing	for myriad occasions- for the traveler a wedding a newborn child	the sick the new year for any good purpose.	9.656006959037779
15177. the preparations	were elaborate: flowers candles incense sticks rice wine dozens	of delicacies and pieces of white cotton string.	5.249471293316733
15178. the strings were	draped around flowers in tall silver bowls.	10.222451671537508
15179. the	candles were lighted and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village	notables.	5.362750568882143
15180. i was careful to keep my feet the seat of the least worthy	spirits from pointing at anyone's head where the worthiest spirits	reside.	8.496689982263185
15181. now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to	come and join us.	7.544584908646611
15182. next he addressed himself to our souls.	12.217841688978094
15183. a	man has 32 souls one for each part of the body.	8.268581728483278
15184. those souls like to	wander off and must be called back.	11.686459478905213
15185. with the divinities present	and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power.	7.716944679539616
15186. then one after another the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings	around our wrists.	10.438573778745017
15187. these were to be kept on to hold in the 32 souls.	12.87023732492572
15188. as we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to john	cool and silently showed him his hand.	11.671386494130429
15189. it had a festering hole as	big as a silver dollar.	10.047258622931235
15190. we could see maggots moving.	17.720345522795856
15191. john said:	i have some antiseptic salve with me but it's too late for	that.	3.364367409964936
15192. my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening	of religious and ethnic bonds.	7.606215209293063
15193. jewish identity was often confused	with social and economic strivings.	7.492390348398147
15194. being jewish gives you tremendous	drive a boy remarked.	10.079328475785971
15195. it means that you have to get	ahead.	23.094671457023146
15196. when i pressed for a purely religious definition i encountered	the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and	a small residue of ethnic loyalty.	8.336350165671218
15197. i like the tradition	a girl said.	12.664695334723902
15198. i like to follow the holidays when they come along.	16.308646899891237
15199. but you don't have to worship in the traditional way.	5.576416897197443
15200. you can communicate	in your own way.	17.11036661676322
15201. as i see it there's no real difference between	being jewish catholic or protestant.	7.2847455646850365
15202. another teen-ager	remarked: most jews don't believe in god but they believe	in people- in helping people.	4.51584312791419
15203. still another boy asserted:	to be a good jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person.	5.547416735800911
15204. when asked how this was different from being a good protestant	the boy answered it's the same thing.	8.468983237395623
15205. this accords	with the study by maier and spinrad.	8.563198626579005
15206. they discovered that although	42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the	protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings	of their religion only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this	conviction.	14.583037896257823
15207. the most important aims of the jewish students were as	follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent;	to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence-	21 per cent.	4.617641237281893
15208. nevertheless most of the teen-agers	i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even	envisioned joining a synagogue or temple.	7.839337537326543
15209. however they were hostile	to jewish orthodoxy professing to believe in judaism but in a	moderate way.	6.915469292061459
15210. one boy said querulously about orthodox jews: it's	the twentieth century and they don't have to wear beards.	5.24037020901106
15211. the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked	force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds.	7.549883888206203
15212. we were brought	up that way was one statement which won general assent.	11.579907749952564
15213. i	want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which	a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism.	6.2714678715939085
15214. still	another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons	since i'll be living in a suburb.	7.680540115430505
15215. intermarriage which	is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not	with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval.	6.58048116628559
15216. most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic	grounds.	11.85780508254733
15217. when you marry you want to have things in common a	girl said and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your	own background.	4.3074793121346975
15218. a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle	west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered	with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities	that many middle class jews now regard as religious.	6.160444754086247
15219. it appears	that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing	sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would	not travel on saturday and in addition required kosher food.	8.40414600037625
15220. another	girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the	only orthodox girl in town.	8.238141757847336
15221. this is no doubt inaccurate	but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the	nonobservant.	9.095616324441917
15222. one of the significant things about	jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.	21.196198058198057
15223. sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college	age attend institutions of higher learning.	6.437301547128894
15224. this is substantially higher	than the figures for the american population at large- 45.	13.326813252736821
15225. 6 per	cent for males and 29.	8.472856489431608
15226. 2 per cent for females.	21.571088618316207
15227. this may help explain	a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy.	7.970541063571823
15228. in their first two	years in high school jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions	to win positions on the school teams.	11.592661034994759
15229. however in their junior and	senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably	in the interest of better academic achievement.	6.967578629218365
15230. it is significant	too that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed unlike the	younger ones that jewish students tend to do better academically than	their gentile counterparts.	9.399376364352916
15231. the percentage of jewish girls	who attend college is almost as high as that of boys.	10.611867072513002
15232. the motivations	for both sexes to be sure are different.	12.267876741394275
15233. the vocational motive is	the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social	reasons and to become culturally developed.	6.242650180065343
15234. one of the significant	developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers	are largely the women.	11.965140234662103
15235. it is they who read- and make- jewish	best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.	6.820722359305213
15236. in	upper teen jewish life the non-college group tends to have a sense	of marginality.	8.05442439723018
15237. people automatically assume that i'm in college	a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably.	4.0415116368077175
15238. however among	the girls there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going	to college.	8.257643726242762
15239. the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an	office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and buttressed	by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live	more expansively than the college student.	5.042827637571264
15240. she is even prone to regard	the college girl as immature.	12.630249322190814
15241. one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers	in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend	local colleges at modest cost.	9.891380165717228
15242. this is particularly true in large centers	of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia.	14.094594478069997
15243. what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is	that although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their	gentile counterparts	they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed	jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish	world.	5.325249330681076
15244. perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college-	constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can	serve as a paradigm of the urban lower-middle class jewish student.	8.755336813859868
15245. there is to begin an important sex difference.	19.795165493162028
15246. typically in	a lower-middle class jewish family a son will be sent to an out-of-town	school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will	attend the local college.	6.051127523521067
15247. there are two reasons for this.	28.52005242185339
15248. first	the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's.	7.333978818598691
15249. second	the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter	than toward the son.	6.533251602391525
15250. most jewish mothers are determined to exercise	vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by	keeping them home.	10.165491020070903
15251. the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn	college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.	10.88768104038287
15252. one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.	15.393305425914702
15253. brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their	school.	8.821576802229993
15254. on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond	the ambiance of their high school.	15.99604227984772
15255. this is particularly acute for	those who attended midwood high school directly across the street	from brooklyn college.	9.303728109779364
15256. they have a sense of marginality at being denied	that special badge of status the out-of-town school.	10.422066985054727
15257. at the same	time there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good	college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable	virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling	that the college generates.	5.462312129707974
15258. it's people of your own kind a girl	remarked.	3.7980906791155147
15259. you don't have to watch what you say.	5.21180993719824
15260. of course	i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds	of people but i would want lots of jewish kids there.	11.151422540480855
15261. for	most brooklyn college students college is at once a perpetuation	of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood	and family.	7.433799958819433
15262. rooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in	tone and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably	midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.	7.68964961725602
15263. however a	growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by	courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly	critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents.	5.658744010720648
15264. and	the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional	conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they	view as softly and insidiously enveloping.	8.021871458928393
15265. as long as i'm home	i'll never grow up a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.	5.176372903050479
15266. they don't like it if i do anything away from home.	7.396335857268548
15267. it's so	much trouble i don't usually bother.	1.2378634834264726
15268. for girls the overprotection	is far more pervasive.	12.580539504272545
15269. parents will drive on friday night	to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting.	6.686380279103105
15270. a freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn	college and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out	with his daughter.	7.542269531620928
15271. the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice	of a major field.	7.410367277669822
15272. under pressure from parents the majority of brooklyn	college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with	marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient	working hours.	7.020564841450971
15273. this means that a great many academically talented girls	are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.	9.411431075270267
15274. a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls	as it does in the realm of sex.	10.599510182010215
15275. the breaking away from the prison	house of brooklyn is gradual.	8.801039775971512
15276. first the student trains on his	hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological	and sociological insights.	8.865421862521474
15277. then with the new affluence there is	actually a sallying forth into the wide wide world beyond the precincts	of new york.	6.660968497437725
15278. it is significant that the catskills which used to	be the summer playground for older teen-agers a kind of summer suburb	of new york no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for	those who work there as waiters bus boys or counselors in the day	camps.	7.540558204510521
15279. the great world beyond beckons.	11.123125907140231
15280. but it should be pointed out	that some of the new watering places- fire island nantucket westhampton	long island for example- tend to be homogeneously jewish.	9.059063949439764
15281. although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad	program a good number of students spend summers in europe.	6.319829449889541
15282. in	general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that	of the student at harvard or smith.	8.745550239580526
15283. and acculturation into the world	at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after	college rather than during the four school years.	7.710669154287799
15284. brooklyn	college is marjorie morningstar territory as much as the bronx or	central park west.	8.932060103892477
15285. there are hordes of nubile young women there	who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry.	8.22527696784161
15286. it is interesting that although the percentage of married students	is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per	cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class-	the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate.	11.721913444946166
15287. almost	everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically.	7.0008730188626425
15288. and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities	and houses that have good	news to impart.	9.215569748383038
15289. these announcements are in effect advertisements	for themselves as thriving marriage marts.	7.103540000852307
15290. there are boxed proclamations	in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagements and	marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity.	9.370788104253508
15291. witt house	happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz	of fife house.	5.382863597363024
15292. the brooklyn college student shows	some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models.	10.328816517894435
15293. the ivy	league enjoys no easy dominion here and the boys are as likely to	dress in rather foppish continental fashion or even in nondescript	working class manner as they are in the restrained button-down ivy	way.	7.039792102325155
15294. the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts	out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant	hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel-	are not unknown even in early morning classes.	6.997396677112011
15295. among the	boys there is very little bravado about drinking.	8.87245802158247
15296. brooklyn college	is distinctive for not having an official drinking place.	9.322123245525239
15297. the fort lauderdale	encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college	boys.	7.699155705458043
15298. this should be used frequently.	23.141411969862958
15299. for galled	breasts the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard	enough white chalk to make a paste.	7.3763230233789185
15300. this could also be used for any	other skin irritation.	14.233464880149025
15301. or she might place cornstarch in the oven for	a short time and then apply this under her breasts.	7.787782526216763
15302. female	troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the	frontier; at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind	in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation.	8.426213506480808
15303. the sufferer	drinks tansy tea.	9.877609856374363

15305. bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of	raw beefsteak.	7.7250588160002955
15306. salted butter was	another	cure for bruises.	10.260234182662947
15307. many people agreed that burns should be treated	with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard but one informant	told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed	watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by	bathing it with epsom salts.	5.42922561959601
15308. another swore by vinegar baths for burns	and still another recommended salted butter.	8.105324148873306
15309. butter salve or	butter ointment was used for burns and for bruises as well.	7.436642195625237
15310. this	was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;	when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled.	8.564666728784832
15311. cow's	milk was another cure for burns and burns covered with gum arabic or	plain mucilage healed quickly.	5.318135787666271
15312. one man badly burned about the face and	eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor	at the time.	9.731840686000561
15313. a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings	which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat.	6.790063882506718
15314. later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns.	11.698801027962572
15315. the results	were good but which treatment helped is still not known.	8.139447079955149
15316. to	stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds.	8.587081402481719
15317. one old-timer	said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut even when on a knuckle if it	was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent	infection.	5.518360323770703
15318. my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy	for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury	and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth over which she poured	turpentine.	7.150082612583608
15319. he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically	amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar	showing.	7.076842684269743
15320. tobacco was common first aid.	10.186012480003827
15321. a chaw of tobacco put	on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing.	6.782542296380565
15322. or a thin slice	of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing.	9.814990626662775
15323. one	old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a	fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his	head.	7.766405144959441
15324. his brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached	the boy the father sliced a new plug of tobacco put the scalp back	in place and covered the raw edges with the slices.	7.520881523062133
15325. then he put a rag	around the dressing to keep it in place.	10.317304915046801
15326. there was no cleaning or further	care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no	scar.	13.984848015022834
15327. veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding	and rue was an antiseptic.	6.961002351430805
15328. until quite recently sterile maggots	could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface	leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.	8.95588238762743
15329. tetanus	could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound.	6.831380780092917
15330. one family	bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips or if these were not	handy plain lard.	8.803128287236147
15331. another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the	wounded foot or hand in the smoke.	7.034366312216406
15332. rabies were cured or prevented	by madstones which the pioneer wore or carried.	8.001060945151995
15333. in 1872 there were	known to be twenty-two in norton county and one had been in the	family for 200 years.	6.6917202196566725
15334. another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds	then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.	8.923631458839546
15335. while nowadays	we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at	the nose not long ago a nosebleed was simply that and treatment had	little	variation.	9.088220364863522
15336. since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack	was usually first aid.	9.14874295120259
15337. this might be applied to the top of the nose	or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the	nostril.	12.132832473628612
15338. nosebleed could be	stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and	tying in it a knot for each year of his life.	6.941022501864754
15339. or the victim could chew	hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in	his ears.	7.750695723702263
15340. old sores could be healed by the constant application	of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water.	8.531114001601779
15341. blood blisters could	be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with	any hard nonpoisonous substance.	5.41977767749507
15342. felons were cured by taking common	salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal	parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on	a cloth and wrapped around the affected part.	8.013644719803724
15343. as the cloth dried more	of the mixture was applied and after twenty-four hours the felon was	supposed to be killed.	6.425990079900597
15344. insect bites were cured in many	ways.	10.665393000919167
15345. many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; get a bite	spit on it was a proverb.	5.288254748644721
15346. this was used also for bruises.	16.82936737801656
15347. yellow	clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings;	not long ago denver mud was most popular.	6.224011147325658
15348. chiggers were a	common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so	small as to be scarcely visible to the eye they buried themselves in	the victim's flesh.	6.451713671028427
15349. bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief	and also killed the pests.	6.087787742492667
15350. ant bites were eased by applying liquid	bluing.	9.749660936406361
15351. for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half	a glass of soda was made.	8.146976153267525
15352. for wasp stings onion juice obtained by	scraping an onion gave quick relief.	9.044204260413839
15353. a handier remedy was to bathe the	painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well	as soap.	6.024564147150684
15354. just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve	wasp or bee stings.	11.257375537009382
15355. bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days;	to keep them out of homes even in the 1900's was a chore.	5.270183478711153
15356. bed	slats were washed in alum water legs of beds were placed in cups	of kerosene and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate	applied with a feather.	7.310838746480929
15357. kerosene was very effective in ridding	pioneer homes of the pests.	6.714162850542327
15358. at times pioneer children got lice in their	hair.	13.17582079906435
15359. a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the	job.	8.179420270991669
15360. to remove an insect from one's ear warm water should	be inserted.	7.189081610141476
15361. a cinder or other small object could be removed from the	eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye.	6.6459221718704065
15362. as the seed swelled its glutinous	covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder	and the seed could soon be washed out.	8.665911451168068
15363. another way to remove small	objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle	would then move toward the nose where it could be wiped out with	a wisp of cotton.	6.2451068732360975
15364. shingles were cured by gentian an old drug	used in combinations.	9.082413147187147
15365. for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and	one	ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth.	7.357935707059119
15366. itching	skin considered just nerves was eased by treating with	whiskey and salt.	8.110057622719243
15367. winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider	in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped.	5.802700083351913
15368. to cure fungus growths	on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of	sassafras bark in a quart of water.	8.335932052167179
15369. they drank half a cup of this morning	and night and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same	solution.	7.881780521775881
15370. six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and	had defied other remedies.	8.843990563171108
15371. frostbite was treated by putting the feet	and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow.	6.504481631269185
15372. now one hears that	heat and hot water are used instead.	10.836851070062352
15373. another remedy was oil of eucalyptus	used as well for chilblains.	8.005025287452288
15374. chilblains were also treated with	tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.	8.090068922357998
15375. boils have always been	a source of much trouble.	7.362061751145684
15376. a german informant gave me a sure cure	made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice.	8.661322563043864
15377. another poultice	was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water	until it formed a sticky gummy solution.	6.349459921161144
15378. this was also used for sores.	19.994085211233763
15379. another frequent pioneer difficulty caused by wearing rough and heavy	shoes and boots was corns.	5.803219954031707
15380. one veracious woman tells me she has	used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they	remove the pain or fire.	7.839798725117468
15381. another common cure was to soak the	feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of	equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.	6.302602650764027
15382. this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed	the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.	10.039030227388952
15383. there were many cures for warts.	15.688558541275997
15384. one young girl told me how her	mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in	vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several	times.	8.925074153164207
15385. another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a	bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the	house for seven days.	5.955747975227704
15386. saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's	sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on	wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear	after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did	just that.	7.671473793396991
15387. one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.	8.886598478969452
15388. another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours tie	it on the wart and wear it for a week.	8.52286653084135
15389. a simpler method was to tie	a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way.	7.430522723988387
15390. one person recommended to me washing the wart with	sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato	three times daily.	8.360866872984477
15391. another common method was to cut an onion in two and	place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened	together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave.	5.757715586006151
15392. as the	onion decayed so did the wart.	12.774126028271699
15393. sore muscles were relieved by	an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot an herb from the pioneer's	ubiquitous herb garden or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water	in which two cups of salt had been dissolved.	4.355379752535979
15394. leg cramps one person	tells me were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the	body on the heel and pressing down hard.	9.2148595056692
15395. this does give relief as i	can testify.	11.265529231182079
15396. one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy	before each meal for leg cramps.	9.062635948392407
15397. pains in the back of the leg and in	the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope	about the patient's waist.	6.860893517181053
15398. for sprains and swellings one	pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added	to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.	9.919511850446261
15399. except for the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable	plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the keys to unlock	the gates of the wine world are one's dealer and the foreign shipper	or negociant who in turn supplies him.	5.2542893456204665
15400. in instances where	both of these are persons or firms with integrity the situation is ideal.	10.98316584720472
15401. it may on occasion be anything but that.	13.853610860591965
15402. however by cultivating	a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain	whether he has any knowledge of wines	and better yet whether he	has a taste for wine.	8.27388933507867
15403. again by spreading one's purchases over several	wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties	of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad.	5.125118512516501
15404. this is important because	despite all the efforts of the french government an appreciable	segment of france's export trade in wines is still tainted with a	misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty and there are many	too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a	creditable reputation overseas.	8.082852958123201
15405. a good negociant or shipper	will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from	the best vineyards or the best parts of them; he may also be the	one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards	generally in his own district.	5.201566774629228
15406. these are the wines the french themselves	use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one	drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis.	8.292346132722662
15407. the grands	crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them.	6.934548071390817
15408. and certainly	in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine	drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready	for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse	to crus of less renown.	8.817614681124017
15409. there is nothing infra dig about a	good blend from a good shipper.	12.086429765926027
15410. some of them are very delicious indeed	and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately along with	others not so good and worse.	10.454614795163744
15411. consultation with a reputable wine dealer	and constant experimentation- steering ever from the known to	the unknown- are the requisites.	4.678606681769407
15412. wine waiters are something	else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great	deal their importance mounts.	7.052305956755287
15413. most of them the world over operate	on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and	some other latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty	of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof	on the customer himself.	6.655075319893187
15414. now the drinking of wine	is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone	in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the	supply would dry up in no time at all.	9.31991062271369
15415. this is the only valid and extenuating	argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible	attitude of the common wine waiter.	9.810260243689987
15416. a really good wine waiter is	paradoxically the guardian of his cellar against	the visigoths.	9.620807861103517
15417. faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible	supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped	with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine	waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence.	7.3084813104215085
15418. the one way to	get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking	to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter	is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending	money.	7.686020004240804
15419. only then perhaps will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.	7.746325593006539
15420. wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest	for several weeks before it is served.	10.974712744736701
15421. this is especially true of	red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well	worth the effort.	7.842161651467512
15422. it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter	of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal.	12.684057388010729
15423. wine stored	for a long time should be on its side; otherwise the cork dries	and air enters to spoil it.	6.022105916145117
15424. when stacking wine on its side in a bin	care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next	to the cork.	13.580928949929557
15425. fat bottles such as burgundies have a way of rolling	around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard	or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture.	7.022267981551842
15426. too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects.	12.029730607317234
15427. the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine	is to smell the wet end of the cork after	pulling it: if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right;	if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion.	5.7190185747071896
15428. seasonal	rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely.	6.894112999808679
15429. the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five	degrees with an allowable range of five degrees above or below	this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes.	5.747845460247734
15430. prolonged vibration	is also undesirable; consequently one's wine closet or cellar	should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces.	5.133727270493391
15431. if	one lives near a subway or an express parkway the solution is to have	one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.	5.785149498848727
15432. light especially daylight is always bad for wine.	10.900036094091394
15433. all in	all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations	thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go	to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without	further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious	cork.	6.1186509309482915
15434. no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure	they derive from all this and to give fair warning where warning	is due no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree	of purism! but the fact remains that in most restaurants including	some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon the bottle	is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered	and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place	while the chef is preparing the meal.	7.981255294635877
15435. a white wine already at cool	cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and	water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator	in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter	climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow.	6.835797583343649
15436. though	by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought	from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so	before serving time.	9.227651159483992
15437. it may be a bit cold when poured; but again	as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should	be served in a large tulip-shaped glass which is never filled more	than half full.	6.461701591073022
15438. in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly-	and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste	and fragrance until after the middle of the meal in	the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting	stages.	11.863162826245265
15439. the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming	a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an	open fire.	8.378899558961773
15440. this invariably effaces any wine's character and drives	its fragrance underground.	7.361482457047659
15441. it should not be forgotten that	wines mature fastest in half-bottles less fast in full bottles slowly	in magnums- and slower yet in tregnums double magnums jeroboams	methuselahs and imperiales respectively.	5.8823587877692525
15442. very old red wines	often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from	the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed	some air.	8.406034274424185
15443. but white wines never! white wines should be opened	when served having been previously chilled in proportion to their	sweetness.	6.545788006576649
15444. thus sauternes or barsacs should be very cold; a pouilly-fuisse	or a chablis somewhat less cold.	6.1751382877720715
15445. over-chilling is an accepted	method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white	wine especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving	a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive.	4.7139844266636715
15446. the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death	when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air.	9.172519453368588
15447. to quote	professor saintsbury: the last glass of claret or burgundy	is as good as the first; but the first glass of chateau d'yquem	or montrachet is a great deal better than the last! this does not	mean though that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there	is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or	the next day after they have once been opened are never as good.	5.05144454964822
15448. if	this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place;	it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably	shorter than those of milk.	8.564737219338973
15449. a few red wines notably those	of the beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature.	6.885808439968078
15450. by	tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-	if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin	and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well.	7.294828156143677
15451. thus	red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken; very old	red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which	have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.	5.418945869900019
15452. a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may	do as much harm as a week at sea.	7.540680426893778
15453. the cork should be pulled gradually	and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.	7.396504024036045
15454. many	people use wicker cradles for old red wine lifting the bottle carefully	from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without	disturbing the sediment.	8.755348135338895
15455. another school frowns on such a shortcut and	insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand	on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom	after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position	on its side in the cradle.	6.564523721691318
15456. in france when one wishes to entertain	at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines one visits the	restaurant well ahead of time chooses the wines and with the advice	of the manager and his chef builds the menu around them.	9.470118291643175
15457. the wine	waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened	at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allowed to stand on	end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines	be decanted.	8.512104872883153
15458. decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be-	practically speaking- a matter of good economy.	6.004037319179056
15459. for in the process	of decanting the bottle is only tilted once instead of several	or more times at the table: hence a minimum of the undesirable mixture	of wine and dregs.	7.145694207460918
15460. though there are many exceptions which	we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed	between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three	and ten.	9.701345105814053
15461. red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep	longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite	number red burgundy.	4.8567102266025355
15462. some clarets do not come into their own until	they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more.	10.482214346692063
15463. if a red bordeaux	of a good name and year is bitter or acid or cloying and muddy-tasting	leave it alone for a while.	6.282197580932767
15464. most of the wines of beaujolais on	the other hand should be drunk while very young; and alsatians	may be.	9.851099983593175
15465. giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: rest assured that	your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter	and spirit strictly complied with h and most particularly in regard	to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane	views.	5.898901197587319
15466. giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.	10.963272262029816
15467. the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey's	overseer.	10.203173107802867
15468. an excellent crop was expected that year.	13.353424691032368
15469. william	who lived in neighboring st mary's parish had taken charge and	decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated	for another year.	6.367356097599139
15470. giffen advised acceptance of this plan citing the	depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions	at the plantation.	8.380096698232474
15471. if sold then the land and improvements might	bring only $5000.	9.254450481254699
15472. early in january 1844 he had a conference with	henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorham's	intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother.	8.463265692268577
15473. the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs	he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless	negroes.	8.092659165547678
15474. they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation	and louisiana law required their removal from the state.	9.721151914349445
15475. gorham	refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how	much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the	north involved?	6.1581378651790875
15476.  the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was	not realistic since no planter would take the risk of having negroes	who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves.	10.204776275949229
15477. henry hid	his annoyance although both he and william were furious with their	yankee brother.	6.731422924021468
15478. william who did not write to gorham told giffen	that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would	sue amicably to protect his interests.	9.86929927913383
15479. palfrey was	determined	that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers	during the transition period before emancipation.	7.994458040033374
15480. if william wished	to continue operations for a year why not simply leave the negroes	undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever	paid the labor of persons of their sex + age.	8.458488788092382
15481. a disposition to exert	themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them	h to come into the scheme.	7.52780369554787
15482. their having family ties on our plantation	+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement.	8.696320305351877
15483. when he heard	of his brothers' anger palfrey was still hopeful that they could	be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages.	6.305797089803587
15484. if not he was willing	to accede to william's wishes in any way that did not block	his ultimate aim.	9.384190815740073
15485. william was adamant on one point: under no circumstances	would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his	and henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.	5.272795971836401
15486. knowing	the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the	number of free negroes giffen suggested that palfrey bring them	to boston at once and then send them on to liberia.	7.975421768313216
15487. lacking specific	instructions he agreed to william's condition.	7.318436653492218
15488. in march	there was a division of the slaves and giffen carried out his instructions	as nearly as possible.	11.117667674738973
15489. of the fifty-two slaves giffen succeeded	in getting a lot of twenty twelve of whom were females.	7.903065563204451
15490. i considered	that your views would be best carried out he explained	by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend	the philantrophy of emancipation.	7.422538869565351
15491. i have also taken the old servants	of your father as a matter of conscience + justice.	8.575545966142043
15492. the ages	of the slaves ranged from sixty-five for an old house servant to	an unnamed newborn child.	7.013802870332398
15493. if palfrey ever had any doubts about the	wickedness of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory	of the slave property he had inherited.	7.309996630371007
15494. this cold reckoning of human	worth in a legal paper devoid of compassion or humanity was all	he needed.	8.846365735305929
15495. each human being known only by a given name had a cash value.	7.378452770971545
15496. old sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;	rose a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential was worth $400.	4.423433357182532
15497. in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property palfrey	was giving up close to $7000.	9.907673088761344
15498. palfrey's brothers each received	lots of sixteen negroes and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed	that all lots were to be valued at $6666.	7.085965997911591
15499. thus twenty black	souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land	of free men.	6.5929796152927995
15500. giffen extracted one concession from william: the house	servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient.	7.803766261196256
15501. despite giffen's warning palfrey still had plans for freeing	his slaves in louisiana.	5.789095552196232
15502. yet even if he could get the necessary approval	fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special	permission.	11.469906859340703
15503. according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty	years old before he could be freed.	10.335805525986261
15504. palfrey petitioned the state legislature	to waive the requirement.	10.418887388914142
15505. otherwise freedom would mean removal	from the state in which as the place of their past residence from	birth or for many years it would h be materially for their advantage	to be at liberty to remain.	7.8229963100850926
15506. on march 11 the louisiana legislature	voted unanimously to table the petition.	12.707755806271866
15507. news of the legislative	veto appeared in the new orleans papers and henry and william	became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt	in advance.	9.33878397615978
15508. henry stormed into giffen's office waving a copy of	the new orleans courier shouting that the emancipation scheme	had become a public affair and that it would reach the ears of the	people on the plantation and make them restless + unhappy.	7.995654225294388
15509. his brothers' anger caused palfrey genuine concern for he had	imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves and to keep	the family from falling apart over the issue.	4.635787722957189
15510. when giffen decided	to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey gorham readily	assented vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers	would never have any cause to complain of him.	10.335186513525734
15511. in view of these	difficulties palfrey decided to go to louisiana.	13.932312432080819
15512. giffen had already	urged him to journey south if only for a few days to clear up matters.	11.945372083664097
15513. his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him	to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april.	7.937222856648053
15514. palfrey	told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for new	orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence	that he might be allowed to see his family again.	10.683121115981088
15515. during his journey	palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists.	10.287095316209037
15516. in both cases he	desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived	in the north.	12.087816219381256
15517. in new york lydia maria child welcomed him	enthusiastically: i have lately heard of you from the legislature	of louisiana and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood	of man.	6.229258435696342
15518. mrs child who had once apologized for sending	editor palfrey a book on slavery now confided that she had helped one	of henry palfrey's slaves escape to canada some years before	but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana.	8.070571530869193
15519. she agreed to	take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send	them north immediately.	7.766524132761271
15520. at lexington kentucky palfrey consulted	with cassius m clay on the same subject but with no apparent	result.	9.983356380395653
15521. despite his apprehensions about his personal safety	palfrey's reception in new orleans was more than cordial.	7.4583950057792405
15522. instead	of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission	he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark	on whom i had no sort of claim + have had many more invitations	than i could accept.	7.550210974870922
15523. he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of	the marked attention and civility with which the new orleans	gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him.	6.604686583950822
15524. the memory of this southern	hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years	and civil war.	9.966419227944739
15525. palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic	account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas	many of whom were coarse + passionate people much excited by what	they heard of my plans.	4.0405209981413694
15526. he proceeded with his task bravely- in	his memoirs at least- before the passions of my neighbors should	have time to boil too high.	6.817851569062991
15527. palfrey had already made up his	mind that he would allow the men but not the women to choose freely	whether or not to go north for freedom.	8.449642926371066
15528. the women by remaining behind	condemned their children born and unborn to bondage.	10.62043571582175
15529. he had a	short private talk with each adult slave.	10.038118327415853
15530. only one objected but palfrey	soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others.	11.763666862381314
15531. all the	slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure	until the end of the planting season so that they could get in their	own little produce.	9.187244523162382
15532. palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain	as wage laborers for his account.	7.64014888205092
15533. william's threat that under	no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with	his own was not carried out for the plantation continued in operation	as before.	4.645851312882674
15534. palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to	have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience.	7.001438698010974
15535. from cambridge palfrey maintained a close interest	in the welfare of his slaves.	8.637336783773375
15536. in fact as the time for their departure	approached his solicitousness increased.	15.553447268375772
15537. should any slave change	his mind and request to leave earlier giffen was to provide passage	at once.	6.8152601985877554
15538. when a sailing date of march 1845 was finally	established	palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters	in new orleans and aboard ship.	10.113315086432708
15539. giffen assured him that the captain	and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration.	6.9477574710719
15540. palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage	to pay for their labor throughout 1844.	10.484432278989349
15541. the plantation was sold in january	1845 and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people	two months' wages.	7.097634056590945
15542. giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation	for a year's work; the new owner at attakapas declined to	enter into any philanthropic arrangement.	5.627994356361146
15543. on march 21 1845 the	bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans while on the levee	henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father's former	chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled	regret and jubilation.	5.99043756560595
15544. not all of palfrey's slaves were	aboard the bashaw.	10.822541793202726
15545. giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult	to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants.	9.971689932640736
15546. two of	these were included in palfrey's lot.	9.029025494943104
15547. giffen filed a petition for	permission to emancipate four slaves	with the st martin's parish police jury.	4.975843063087625
15548. after an initial rejection	which he attributed to a general excitement against abolition	and emancipation giffen bribed the right individuals on the	jury and got the permission without further delay.	8.414993664713311
15549. when the	negroes landed at boston a month later they were of course no longer	slaves.	8.139628123844451
15550. slavery was prohibited in massachusetts by the terms of	the constitution of 1780 which declared all men are born free and	equal.	9.443000819757879
15551. nevertheless palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at king's	chapel to formalize the emancipation.	5.549339913999766

15597. one tempest was stirred up last	march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue	of william jennings bryan sculpted by the late gutzon borglum	would be sent on indefinite loan to salem illinois bryan's	birthplace.	5.19182808851849
15598. spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors	promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his	own hostility to this art form.	5.428050954531786
15599. they dug up a speech he had made two	years earlier as a congressman decrying the more than two hundred	statues monuments and memorials which dot the washington landscape	h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching	new plans.	6.118690002061288
15600. hoping to cut down on such works udall had proposed	that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.	10.295222098230454
15601. he is not likely to win this battle easily.	16.23693376873289

15606. washington president kennedy	has been heard to remark ironically is a city of southern efficiency	and northern charm.	9.562313213035797
15607. there have been indications that he hopes	to redress that situation commencing with the white house.	10.548351824269366
15608. one of	mrs kennedy's initial concerns as first lady was the sad state	of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national	shrine.	9.140631068586039
15609. ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture	assembled by president thomas jefferson the white house has collected	a hodgepodge of period pieces few of them authentic or aesthetic.	7.455622069570707
15610. mrs kennedy shows a determination to change all this.	12.01390006099082
15611. not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk hewed from	the timbers of the british ship hms resolute and	presented to	president hayes by queen victoria.	5.947021824210854
15612. it now serves the president	in his oval office.	15.322201923420675

15615. with its coating of gold radiator paint removed-	a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its	rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white	house.	6.29410646826787
15616. but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century	furniture	for	must be pursued in places other than government storage	rooms.	11.44913838325704
15617. the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee	for the white house to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange	ways to acquire them.	8.919764499598573

15626. woman's place is in the home:	man must attend to matters of the yard.	7.004588845633224
15627. one of the vexatious problems	to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just	across pennsylvania avenue from the white house.	9.376870483579724
15628. congress had	already appropriated money and plans were well along to tear down the	buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one	critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings.	7.613679402602945
15629. while a senator kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to	preserve the belasco theater as well as the dolley madison and the	benjamin taylor houses all scheduled for razing.	6.7859848457858885
15630. what to	do about it now that he was president?	16.639909345390542
15631.  only a few days after moving	into the white house.	11.881456376314159
15632. kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square.	12.786205988528211
15633. then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem	to him with instructions to work out what was best- provided it	didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the president.	6.005868901879007
15634. the situation	involved some political perils.	12.356991677106755
15635. one of the offices slated for reconstruction	is the aged court of claims diagonally across the street	from the white house.	9.101055126103445
15636. logically it should be moved downtown.	12.291197771552124
15637. but	judge marvin jones senior member of the court is an elderly	gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk	to work.	6.732900392576112
15638. more importantly he also happens to be the brother-in-law	of sam rayburn speaker of the house.	10.331423747733847
15639. there were aesthetic	problems as well as political.	16.73228231160959
15640. on delving deeper walton discovered	that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified	as early nondescript.	10.215328218695486
15641. the old belasco theater over which many	people had grown sentimental was only a shell of its former self	after arduous years as a uso center.	6.502710214410057
15642. the dolley madison house	walton concluded was scarcely worth preserving.	10.630398161507957
15643. the attempt	to save the square's historic value he declares came half a	century too late.	5.732703239998483
15644. surrounded by ancient elms the campus is spacious and beautiful.	8.290580228881355
15645. the	buildings are mostly georgian.	8.170856023068085
15646. the dartmouth student does not live	in monastic seclusion as he once did.	10.288840654559966
15647. but his is still a simple life	relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go	far even though he may go fast for sophisticated pleasures.	7.695335701432238
15648. he is	still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence if he chooses to be.	10.677558028689878
15649. he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the	last century down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal	for book learning in his heart.	9.313628950880897
15650. the men's shops on hanover's	main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven.	6.668812504275344
15651. and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend	toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke are no less rakish than	those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia.	5.98855004495679
15652. but there has	always been an outdoor air to dartmouth.	16.368701304354584
15653. the would-be sophisticate	and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment.	5.341595977471379
15654. no one	here pokes fun at manly virtues.	10.247150149853383
15655. and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie	probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league.	9.361467795688478
15656. it even affects	the faculty.	20.829646947257444
15657. thus when dartmouth's winter carnival-	widely recognized as the greatest wildest roaringest college weekend	anywhere any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup	prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter	garb topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been	acquired from a smith girl.	4.391186917722621
15658. president dickey's golden retriever	frolicking in the snow at his feet added to the picture of masculine	informality.	11.818799899574701
15659. this carefree disdain for side cropped up	again in the same television broadcast.	7.673464788787469
15660. dean thaddeus seymour wearing	ski clothes was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival.	7.261591041843036
15661. she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown	on her head.	7.884453110914276
15662. no dartmouth man was surprised.	13.516501841550875
15663. dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal	sang-froid.	7.7596113135337825
15664. for example groups regularly canoe down the connecticut	river.	14.325505330281153
15665. this is in honor of john ledyard class of 1773 who scooped	a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in	his own student days.	7.858231138557866
15666. and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated	today.	12.675612103882587
15667. they are hailed by the nation's press and smith girls throng	the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with	hot soup and kisses.	4.622289414876397
15668. dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic	recreation is skiing.	6.920515347628214
15669. since the days when their two thousand	pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united	states the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team	as another name for their own.	6.640501308963585
15670. yet dartmouth still is the dominant	member of the intercollegiate ski union which includes the winter	sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country.	9.884097596353604
15671. dartmouth	students ski everywhere in winter starting with their own front	door.	7.117612053158462
15672. they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him or move	out to oak hill where there's a lift.	7.523695870962006
15673. the dartmouth skiway	at holt's ledge ten miles north of the campus has one of the best	terrains in the east ranging from novice to expert.	7.011859463412703
15674. forty	miles farther north is mount moosilauke dartmouth's own mountain.	6.747694225128929
15675. here at the ravine lodge president dickey acts as host every	year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth	outing club to life on the trails.	7.235104540331841
15676. the lodge built of hand-hewn	virgin spruce can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or	lounging in its huge living room.	7.014579840032088
15677. the outing club also owns a chain	of fourteen cabins and several shelters extending from the vermont	hills just across the river from the college through hanover to the	college grant- 27000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in	the logging country.	6.0752848533614685
15678. the cabins are equipped with bunks blankets	and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips.	8.909091907596295
15679. the club runs regular trips to the cabins but many of the students	prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting	fishing climbing or skiing.	7.200284354592183
15680. under the auspices of the outing	club dartmouth also has the mountaineering club which takes	on tough climbs like mount mckinley and bait + bullet whose interests	are self-evident and even sports a woodman's team which	competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and	chopping	canoe races and the like.	6.0572694416421875
15681. there is much to be said for a college	that while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies still gives	its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along	back roads where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear is not	uncommon.	9.093960391565059
15682. city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle	or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods	logging camp.	9.293350547534427
15683. and on the summit of mount washington where thirty-five	degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered	higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom	to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas because	it is there.	7.722809770596057
15684. there is much to be said for such a college-	and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too	loudly.	14.299615951813172
15685. their affection for their college home has even caused president	dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather	specially hanoverian.	6.6248565628853395
15686. probably a lawyer once said it best for	all time in the supreme court of the united states.	14.962609722752388
15687. early in the	nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about	for a way to found its own state university.	8.415723822069696
15688. it fixed on dartmouth college	which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered.	9.747120114501312
15689. the	legislators decided to liberate dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war	with the college trustees over the control of classrooms faculty	and chapel.	5.586482874261741
15690. for a time there were two factions on the campus	fighting for possession of the student body.	13.866459120568084
15691. the struggle was	resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing	cases in our judicial history.	10.43032046678373
15692. in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating	the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters.	9.228453972303486
15693. a lawyer	hired by the college was arguing specifically for dartmouth:	daniel webster class of 1801 made her plight the dramatic focus	of his whole plea.	5.1744433940019094
15694. in an age of oratory he was the king of orators	and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly	tears as uncle dan'l reached his thundering climax:   it	is sir as i have said a small college and yet there are those	who love it h.	9.17799148107199
15695. dartmouth is today still a small college-	and still a private one thanks to webster's eloquence.	6.265407322293304
15696. this	is not out of keeping with its origins probably the most humble of	any in the ivy group.	12.316103839236197
15697. eleazar wheelock a presbyterian minister	founded the school in 1769 naming it after the second earl of dartmouth	its sponsor and benefactor.	5.865503739339013
15698. eleazar pausing on the hanover plain	found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands	built the first college hall a log hut dedicated for the education	+ instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading	writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and	expedient for civilizing + christianizing children of pagans as well	as in all liberal arts and sciences; and also of english youth	and any others.	5.724049476910989
15699. it was a hardy undertaking and wheelock's	was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness.	7.98981228780161
15700. a road had to	be	hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to	permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first	dartmouth commencement in 1771.	8.398985140333613
15701. the governor and his retinue thoughtfully	brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still	one of the cherished possessions of the college.	6.922007744061818
15702. the exuberance	on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings.	9.935076465993657
15703. a student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned	even before the punch was served.	7.99474505147537
15704. then from the branches of a	near-by tree an indian underclassman disdaining both the platform and	the english language harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue.	6.833574126873233
15705. governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green	beneath the three-hundred-foot pines and a barrel of rum was broached.	6.003784387236878
15706. the cook got drunk and president wheelock proved to be a man	of broad talents by carving the ox himself.	9.313271427527255
15707. future commencements	were more decorous perhaps but the number of graduates increased	from the original four at a relatively slow pace.	7.6411201646399425
15708. by the end of the	nineteenth	century in 1893 when the big three columbia and penn	were populous centers of learning dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine.	9.7157829695186
15709. the dormitories including the beloved dartmouth hall could barely	house two hundred students in spartan fashion.	6.516247405467907
15710. then in 1893	dr william jewett tucker became president and the college's	great awakening began.	8.840621390780703
15711. he transformed dartmouth from a small new	hampshire institution into a national college.	7.650362269378198
15712. by 1907 the number of	undergraduates had risen to 1107.	10.382650369575437
15713. and at his last commencement in	that year dr tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence	of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the	college.	6.611815118997344
15714. the presidents of cornell wisconsin ccny	bowdoin vermont brown columbia princeton yale and harvard	and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there.	7.403084243141885
15715. dartmouth is numerically still a small college today with approximately	twenty-nine hundred undergraduates.	7.980901825459703
15716. but it has achieved a	cross-section of students from almost all the states and two-thirds of	its undergraduates come from outside new england.	9.708252258830154
15717. over 450 different	schools are usually represented in each entering class.	7.964746010160312
15718. only a dozen	or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more	than fifteen men in any single delegation.	10.780949436548717
15719. about two-thirds of the	boys now come from public schools.	5.724397055988797
15720. it is still a college only	and not a university; it is in fact the only college in the ivy	group.	15.16181054283846
15721. however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer	professional curriculums- the dartmouth medical school	the thayer school of engineering	and the amos tuck school of business administration.	5.090595924711016
15722. all	three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of	about two hundred.	7.617528946957322
15723. all three schools coordinate their educational	programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college	proper	place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation	for specialized study.	6.463984443242793
15724. students of the college who are candidates	for the ab degree and can satisfy the academic requirements	of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated	schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the	two-year postgraduate course in one year.	8.277499679415511
15725. the thayer school offers	a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy wins	a bs in engineering.	6.967234449515335
15726. so dartmouth is moving closer	to the others in the ivy group.	13.072142618274638
15727. it is still however the junior member	of the league if not in years at least in the catching up it has	had to do.	10.407207569977784
15728. it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span	the other ivies have enjoyed.	12.934141583732298
15729. however much football has been over-emphasized	the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by	the scoreboard so while yale need never give its record a thought again	since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 dartmouth	had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national	recognition.	5.494326950598872
15730. it has come on with a rush in more significant areas.	15.708407482816614
15731. today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions	might consider somewhat breathtaking.	7.03773830895283
15732. but dartmouth preserves	its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes and although	some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage they	make for lively copy.	8.861267321594264
15733. president emeritus hopkins once proposed	to corral an aristocracy of brains in hanover.	6.550869231151789
15734. the person who left the buggy there has never been identified.	12.98311301374977
15735. it was	a busy street conveniently near the shopping center and unattended	horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.	7.463415499696695
15736. there are	of course many weaknesses in any case against emma.	14.844671704848587
15737. she didn't like	her stepmother but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before	the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage.	6.354058176742694
15738. she had no	way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed.	11.304715206006918
15739. she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized	during her travels.	7.924288913876938
15740. if she avoided the train and hired a buggy	the stableman might have recognized her.	12.206978068149438
15741. if police had checked on	her more thoroughly than is indicated she would be completely eliminated	as a suspect.	7.186464526143747
15742. uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate	popular suspect.	9.890850085889564
15743. his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden	home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him	although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer.	6.533246534477672
15744. lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were	in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been	disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was	a very hot day.	9.588587222025858
15745. it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything	she overheard between her father and her uncle morse.	10.54066992001332
15746. at that	time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s phillips.	10.714029675244317
15747. a few years ago not too long before his death phillips revealed	in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders.	9.796204970102503
15748. he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that	day information which must have come from lizzie.	11.627274102571093
15749. it was obviously	the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door.	9.584918730636351
15750. the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton	as saying long after the trial that if he only knew what borden said	during his conversation with morse he would have convicted somebody.	9.271926113748046
15751. notice knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a	conviction in the trial of lizzie borden.	10.281500777696309
15752. he said he would have convicted	somebody.	34.63836506637757
15753. it is known that morse did associate with	a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at	westport a town not far from fall river.	8.305735141022506
15754. they were a vagabond lot	and considered to be shady and undesirable characters.	10.259560802658605
15755. fall river police	did go to westport to see if they could get any information against	morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from	among these men.	7.318540564230117
15756. these officers found no incriminating information.	10.797336711461105
15757. morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed.	5.2008630277292065
15758. he said he	returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar.	11.221709777689703
15759. the woman	in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said	she left when he did to shop for her dinner.	7.9286637230004215
15760. fall river is not a	fashionable town.	14.454405549794666
15761. the dinner hour there was twelve noon.	10.266678781014065
15762. if this woman	had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping she would have	had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was	eaten at dinner in those days.	8.564605222084234
15763. it is possible that morse told the woman	it was 11:20 but it could have been earlier since she did serve	dinner on time.	9.299716945164514
15764. police did make an attempt to check on morse's alibi.	10.243031834987244
15765. they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he	had taken but the man did not remember morse as a passenger.	7.476941393353445
15766. questioned	further morse said that there had been four or five priests riding	on the same car with him.	11.720016892338972
15767. the conductor did recall having priests	as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also	pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests	riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so morse's statement	really proved nothing.	5.447832011479639
15768. we do know that morse left the house	before nine o'clock.	13.513314585488283
15769. bridget testified she saw him leave through the	side door.	7.352209313391026
15770. morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door.	11.728865511364054
15771. from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked	leisurely to where his niece was staying more than a mile away.	11.072724896334279
15772. he met nobody he knew on this walk.	14.113672744436666
15773. there is no accounting of his movements	in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs	borden was killed.	8.943369022831053
15774. morse testified that while he was having	breakfast in the dining room mrs borden told the servant bridget	i want you to wash these windows today.	10.0939734122517
15775. bridget's testimony	was in direct contradiction.	5.439389330240249
15776. she said it was after she returned	from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs borden told	her to wash the windows.	11.429728061314295
15777. this was long after morse had left the house.	10.66478475853643
15778. morse's knowledge of what mrs borden told bridget could	indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden	there.	8.595624462276687
15779. he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous	visits during the past three or four months alone.	9.79729695918846
15780. and despite knowlton's	attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than	a drum this was not true.	10.188562183582977
15781. the screen door was unlocked for some ten	or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back.	8.909181572242487
15782. it was unlocked	all the time she was washing windows.	17.33423813099795
15783. morse could have returned	openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room	he had occupied.	9.633108781231552
15784. mrs borden would not have been alarmed if she	saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand.	10.564352245887275
15785. he had been to the farm	the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet	at the farm.	9.041868842292873
15786. mrs borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him	and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she	could cry out.	11.179013857384957
15787. he could have left for weybosset street after her	murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.	9.817792636878611
15788. if	he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return he could	have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr borden came	home.	7.170351670319697
15789. with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget	upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to	the house.	7.452052849943894
15790. with the second murder over he could have left hidden the	weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood.	10.333483290316602
15791. his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree	with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding	the side door was odd.	8.768954083468776
15792. there was no close examination of his	clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of	them.	12.54928393962273
15793. and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing	a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.	8.0753694940994
15794. the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was	no financial gain for morse in the murders.	8.976687680580133
15795. on the other side	of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with	whom she was staying.	11.220724858520521
15796. the time would have been shortly after the	murder of mrs borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior.	10.248428886826254
15797. he said he had promised mrs borden to return in time for dinner	and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden	house.	12.444642710446832
15798. what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible	suspect in his trial-book essay?	9.173121438306527
15799.  he wrote:   the	police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr morse as in	possession of guilty knowledge.	5.465450333814284
15800. neither had any interest in the deaths;	indeed it was probably to mr morse's advantage to have	mr and mrs borden alive.	7.6820000861019295
15801. both he and bridget were exonerated	by lizzie herself.	8.622810990415099
15802. that was his complete discussion of bridget	sullivan as a possible suspect.	12.258612208593004
15803. although pearson disbelieved	almost everything lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost	everything she did he happily accepted her statement about bridget	as the whole truth.	5.831891104942058
15804. he felt nothing further need be said about the	servant girl.	13.786678082957806
15805. the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration	but lizzie's expression of her opinion as reported in the	testimony of assistant marshal fleet.	5.937179889982689
15806. this officer had asked lizzie	if she suspected her uncle morse and she replied she didn't	think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned	after them.	10.513131412146286
15807. fleet asked the same question about bridget and lizzie	pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her	room	before her father's murder and came down when she called her.	6.369881420124918
15808. lizzie actually never named any suspect.	10.29082215002929
15809. she told police about	the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some	weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of	town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.	7.3348528319229604
15810. and much as she detested hiram harrington she also did not	accuse him.	10.242569708496456
15811. at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew	anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings	toward	her father.	7.610690652210805
15812. she replied i know of one man that has not been	friendly with him.	13.36309199397492
15813. they have not been friendly for years.	13.230418901430891
15814. asked	who this was she named harrington.	10.256363873661336
15815. her statement certainly was true;	the press reported the same facts in using harrington's interview	but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the	killer.	5.614430671647481
15816. when i interviewed kirby who as a boy picked up pears	in the borden yard i asked if anybody else in the household besides	lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the	murders.	11.319621243780317
15817. he said he had not heard of anybody else.	15.9147707089168
15818. how about bridget	sullivan?	19.976877200154526
15819.  i inquired.	17.86974080434356
15820. oh she was just the maid there	he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant	she was.	9.195116172708406
15821. kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed	at the time of the murders.	9.732205032219802
15822. everyone somehow manages to overlook	completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two	people in and about the house at the time of both murders: lizzie	borden and bridget sullivan.	11.321931324642721
15823. all the officials on the case	seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was	concerned although records in police files contain many reports of	servants who have murdered their employers.	6.417046553923802
15824. true it is no longer cricket	for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing	here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters	and situations.	11.14053636202858
15825. the actions of bridget should be examined	since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her	innocence.	8.021731036621988
15826. there are also other factors that require closer examination.	18.103715501892
15827. the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes	the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the	trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping	her mouth shut.	5.8830825672910905
15828. the people who believe and retell the legend have	apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know	that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to	the detriment of lizzie.	8.891386817344221
15829. if bridget did get any bundles of cash	the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would	have been lizzie borden.	6.670512807920805
15830. bridget was born in ireland one	of fourteen children.	13.877177784838276
15831. she was apparently the pioneer in her family because	she had no close relatives in this country at that time.	8.545492711729123
15832. she worked	as a domestic first in newport for a year and then in south	bethlehem pennsylvania for another year.	10.390881726120249
15833. she finally settled in fall	river and after being employed for a time by a mrs reed was	hired by the bordens.	7.388194442810848
15834. i have previously described how during	the week of the murder bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing	and ironing clothes.	11.603894883077588
15835. her father james upton was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in	the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who	came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor	of the port.	6.937768326423585
15836. a gentleman of the old school mr upton possessed	intellectual power ample means and withal was a devoted christian.	9.232742637470016
15837. the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical	subjects.	8.769548083588587
15838. her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad	interests.	11.507861084979602
15839. there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood	had an unusual mind.	11.903528663437909
15840. she possessed an observant eye a retentive memory	and a critical faculty.	8.844815504475202
15841. when she was nine years old she wrote	a description of a store she had visited.	9.510422862969728
15842. she named 48 items and said	there were many more things which it would take too long to write.	10.927416777182534
15843. an essay on freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the	declaration of independence the freedom given to slaves in canada	and the views of george washington.	7.771034948208264
15844. lucy upton was graduated	from the salem high school when few colleges only oberlin and	elmira were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning	that could not be denied.	7.5670696282214145
15845. a picture of her in high school comes	from a younger schoolmate albert s flint friend of her brother	winslow and later like winslow a noted astronomer.	6.858025137996138
15846. he recalled	lucy as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly	through the boys' study hall to join the class in greek in the little	recitation room beyond.	6.867631928067245
15847. the study of greek was the distinctive	mark of boys destined to go to college and lucy upton too expected	to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.	9.140778759643787
15848. the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this.	17.48526475038978
15849. with four younger	children at home lucy stepped into her mother's role and even after	the brothers and sisters were grown she was her father's comfort	and stay until he died in 1879.	4.5795080062976465
15850. but even so lucy could not give up	her intellectual pursuits.	13.940923749066124
15851. when her brother winslow became a student	at brown university in 1874 she wrote him about a course in history	he was taking under professor diman: what is prof diman's	definition of civilization and take the world through is its progress	ever onward or does it retrograde at times?	5.782348427388542
15852.  do you think i	might profitably study some of the history you do perhaps two weeks	behind you h.	12.33941770387891
15853. and that she proceeded to do.	15.40213548787538
15854. many years later	lucy upton wrote winslow's daughter soon	to be graduated from smith college: while i love botany which	after dabbling in for years i studied according to the methods	of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating	to take up zoology in the way you are doing.	8.759815100633173
15855. whatever was the	science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite	study.	7.908529468346565
15856. her study of history	was persistently pursued.	11.022454662304277
15857. she read maitland's dark ages which	i enjoyed very much; la croix on the customs of the middle	ages; 16 chapters of bryce and liked it more and more;	more chapters of guizot; lecky and stanley's eastern church.	3.6768350229115354
15858. she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions	that came to her as she studied alone.	10.876015777863357
15859. lucy's correspondence	with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken	up with academic studies.	5.676989850832855
15860. she played chess with him by postcard.	13.623549959025494
15861. also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could	make the most words from the letters in importunately.	6.595307275708926
15862. who won	is not revealed but winslow's daughter eleanor says they got up to	1212 words.	7.578397356405577
15863. there was another family interest also.	16.559998271556335
15864. winslow	had musical talents as had his father before him.	9.3625146377257
15865. at different times	he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist.	6.575529960754617
15866. and it was	lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music	at spelman college.	12.105406483078564
15867. winslow upton after graduation from brown	university and two years of graduate study accepted a position	at the harvard observatory.	6.6872196512563615
15868. for three years he was connected with	the us naval observatory and with the us signal corps;	and after 1883 was professor of astronomy at brown university.	8.502810866104394
15869. the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun of which he was	a member took him to colorado virginia and california as well as	to the south pacific and to russia.	7.579091820074992
15870. after her father's death lucy	and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington	dc.	9.071465083010853
15871. their house writes albert s flint	was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful	to one like myself far from home.	6.297703695567255
15872. lucy was a lively part of the	household.	12.761957597575233
15873. moreover she had physical as well as mental vigor.	9.874376825414526
15874. winslow	as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall used to characterize	her as our iron sister.	7.608275482293861
15875. there is reason to suppose that lucy	would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother	had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about	to enter college.	7.512735705462067
15876. as a matter of fact albert s flint expressed	his conviction that her physical strength her mental power her	lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve	her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career	amongst the noted women of this country.	9.23092784666875
15877. while in washington	dc lucy upton held positions in the us census	office and in the pension bureau.	9.350470380332256
15878. they were not sufficiently challenging	however and she resigned in 1887 to go to germany with her	brother winslow and his family while he was there on study.	11.50251619313167
15879. after the	months in europe she returned to boston and became active in church	and community life.	7.776452764331779
15880. what was called an accidental meeting	with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman.	10.991423626503769
15881. here was a cause she believed in.	13.31845659172502
15882. after correspondence with miss	packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles she came	to atlanta in the fall of 1888 to help wherever needed although	there was then no money available to pay her a salary.	10.250876074012144
15883. she served for	a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.	8.723771369572315
15884. her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship	and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students;	of her great power of discernment; of her exquisiteness	of dress her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts	of the hearers; her great love of flowers and plants and birds;	and her close knowledge of individual students.	5.746518148312865
15885. she drew	on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them	at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall she drew on	her purse as well.	5.208001406053093
15886. many a student was able to remain at spelman only	because of her unobtrusive help.	11.31302854638945
15887. under miss upton the work	of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption.	6.060017016583947
15888. after all	she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 and had been since 1891 except	for one year associate principal or dean.	9.017864927802481
15889. she had taught classes	in botany astronomy geometry	and	psychology.	9.24263445990706
15890. miss upton and miss packard as a matter of fact	had many tastes in common.	11.008915109406727
15891. both had eager and inquiring minds; and	both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the	development of sturdy character and christian zeal.	5.813706002688233
15892. both loved the	out-of-doors including mountain climbing and horseback riding.	6.982216317335991
15893. in 1890	when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss	packard it was miss upton who planned the trip and with rare	executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from	beginning to end.	6.659121447127026
15894. so strenuous it was physically with its days of	horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance	for both miss packard and miss upton.	8.416775164915954
15895. yet they thrived on	it.	12.50018144988412
15896. at the fifteenth	anniversary as already quoted miss	upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future	as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons.	9.071627220584261
15897. when dr wallace buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined	to have the science building named for him he wrote miss tapley	h if you had asked me i think i would have	suggested that you name the building for miss upton.	7.393278268415569
15898. her services	to the school for many years were of a very high character and i	have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her.	10.565481967291532
15899. such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary	after the death of miss giles.	6.924145734165325
15900. at the meeting of the	board of trustees on march 3 1910 miss upton presented the annual	report of the president.	11.032023768662043
15901. she noted that no student had been withdrawn	through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase	of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work	had gone forward smoothly.	4.1756011924713805
15902. she urged the importance of more thorough	preparation for admission.	12.683031923478602
15903. the raising of the $25000 improvement	fund two days before the time limit expired and the spontaneous praise	demonstration held afterward on the campus were reported as	events which had brought happiness to miss giles.	5.604078637852032
15904. with the fund in	hand the debt on the boilers had been paid; rockefeller and packard	halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken	for the superintendent's home.	5.9875693924781075
15905. miss upton spoke gratefully of	the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise	the fund and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly	needed current expenses.	6.600368645775312
15906. she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the	many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the	years had made the work so fruitful in results.	8.501812380581887
15907. two bequests	were recorded: one of $200 under the will of mrs harriet a	copp of los angeles; and one of $2000 under the will of miss celia	l brett of hamilton new york a friend from the early days.	5.111996905550136
15908. miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles	was the sorest grief the seminary had ever been called upon	to bear.	9.521311750632576
15909. the daughters of spelman she said had never known or thought	of spelman without her.	7.301920538920668
15910. the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier	had caused them great sorrow but they still had miss giles.	10.62867358979055
15911. now the school was indeed bereft.	11.785588199301921
15912. yet spelman has strong deep roots	and will live for the blessing of generations to come.	9.64334187695984
15913. miss mary jane packard sophia's half-sister became ill in	march 1910; and when school closed she was unable to travel to massachusetts.	4.583229951831169
15914. she remained in atlanta through june and july; she	died on august sixth.	8.593166768208945
15915. before coming on a visit to spelman	in 1885 miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester and	her position there was held open for her for a considerable period.	7.2065364682501105
15916. but	she decided to stay at spelman.	12.343691060254939
15917. she helped with teaching as well	as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes	in geography rhetoric and bookkeeping.	6.311772012912092
15918. soon the office work claimed	all her time.	11.551192659971916
15919. she was closely associated with the founders in all	their trials and hardships.	8.598546837957262
15920. quiet and energetic cheerful and calm	she too was a power in the development of the seminary.	11.181908157720283
15921. miss giles	always used to refer to her as sister.	8.782311308967074
15922. she served as secretary	in the seminary office for 25 years and was in charge of correspondence	records and bookkeeping.	11.703456081281091
15923. the books of the school hold a memorial	to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.	7.644172944159848
15924. mary j packard states a messenger editorial was efficient	pains-taking self-effacing loving radiating the spirit of her	master.	7.21124919528762
15925. with infinite patience she responded to every call no matter	at what cost to herself and to her all went for she was sure to	have the needed information or word of cheer.	6.521784018283363
15926. in a few school districts one finds a link between school and	job.	13.338970288207287
15927. in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money	there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer	on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other.	8.082471873960328
15928. in these cases	a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program saving	a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12.	10.70427302121924
15929. the apprentice	program will involve further education on a part-time basis usually	at night perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high	school.	5.345373941264668
15930. these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such	crafts as auto mechanics carpentry drafting electrical work tool-and-die	work and sheet-metal work.	8.672417590421007
15931. formally organized vocational	programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to	gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time	job on graduation.	7.41158396535336
15932. the diversified occupations program is a	part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on	a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business	employers.	7.326037803014602
15933. the distributive education program operates in	a similar way with arrangements between the school and employers in	merchandising	fields.	7.60647563705581
15934. in both cases the student attends school half-time	and works in a regular job the other half.	10.270950782061524
15935. he receives remuneration	for his work.	10.097372504126255
15936. in a few places cooperative programs between schools	and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing	the student while still in school to develop skills which are	immediately marketable upon graduation.	9.261125271720394
15937. adult education courses	work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of	a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities	for out-of-school youth.	4.684921713499372
15938. in general however it may be said	that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities	play little or no part in the decision of what happens next.	12.31406484019878
15939. if the	student drops out of high school the break with the school is even	more complete.	11.647429524429226
15940. when there is employment opportunity for youth this	arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well.	7.7590483789963915
15941. indeed	in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities	have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were	potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and	went to work.	6.869626012397823
15942. statistically this has represented a loss to the nation	although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in	retrospect may have been a wise one.	9.523724778791996
15943. i make no attempt to measure the	enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work	on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business	which he entered.	8.172840908575239
15944. he may or may not be better off than his	classmate who went on to a college and professional school.	14.189065737809553
15945. but in	the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all	the potential professional talent.	7.280556026574213
15946. in a later chapter dealing	with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arranging	a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any	high school where he is found.	9.502238280703649
15947. in the negro neighborhoods and also	to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of	identification and motivation.	8.538726061994337
15948. high motivation towards higher education	must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches	grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are	essential for academic work.	9.127373370773308
15949. undoubtedly far more can be done in the	lower grades in this regard in the negro schools.	9.661238690668737
15950. however the teacher	can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family	is anti-intellectual.	13.829885775585623
15951. and the fact remains that there are today few	shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.	12.349428423033821
15952. this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern	universities.	21.17108793935818
15953. quite the contrary as i can testify from personal	experience as a former university president.	7.85221211426811
15954. rather we see here	another vicious circle.	12.406724428155721
15955. the absence of successful negroes in the world	of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among	negro youth for academic careers.	7.739192463135425
15956. i believe the situation is improving	but the success stories need to be heavily publicized.	14.755309824841486
15957. here again	we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated	as negroes in the press.	8.522975530702503
15958. how can the vicious circle be broken?	14.889545399932802
15959.  this	is a problem to which leaders of opinion both negro and white	should devote far more attention.	7.539498016497357
15960. it is at least as important as the	more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south.	15.870605506383667
15961. i should like to underline four points	i made in my first report with respect to vocational education.	9.573180077668606
15962. first	and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which	are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation.	9.337631284485763
15963. second	vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and	not require more than half the student's time in those years; however	for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to	begin earlier.	5.613085291079333
15964. third the significance of the vocational courses is	that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize	the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers and this	sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they	are studying at the same time.	9.03327232668434
15965. fourth the type of vocational training	programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the	general locality.	7.654460156881433
15966. this last point is important because if high school	pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain	vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training	the whole idea of relevance disappears.	9.804805906233216
15967. vocational training which	holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable	skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest	in their studies has begun to falter.	6.743365577977517
15968. those who because of population	mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees	would limit vocational education to general rather than specific	skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind	of school experience.	9.286210509303947
15969. i have been using the word vocational	as a layman would at first sight think it should be used.	9.36437238798854
15970. i intend	to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys	and girls.	10.35377301417487
15971. these courses develop skills other than those we think of	when we use the adjective academic.	7.4126369724920815
15972. practically all of these practical	skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained	in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at	once on the basis of the skill.	10.800411160805506
15973. they are in this sense skills marketable	immediately on graduation from high school.	12.751282596309672
15974. to be sure in tool-and-die	work and in the building trades the first job must be often	on an apprentice basis but two years of half-time vocational training	enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.	8.476897475394304
15975. similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography	and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job	at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two	of further study in a community college or secretarial school.	7.096578454353063
15976. of course	it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and	with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.	10.089083383754689
15977. so too is the	mathematical	competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics.	8.286531370360402
15978. in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be	considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student	in his vocation will be called upon to use	some of the skills developed and the competence obtained.	10.795697484897163
15979. in spite	of the shading of one type of course into another i believe it is useful	to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.	7.847019080365936
15980. perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which	proves the rule.	13.386745804196645
15981. today many college bound students try to take a	course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of	this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work	in college and a professional school.	6.502366078184417
15982. most of our largest	cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools.	15.902251005085375
15983. in this respect public education in the large cities differs from education	in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts.	8.686337989535831
15984. the	neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools	because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational	or technical high school instead of the local school.	9.83928137946265
15985. indeed one	school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term	comprehensive	high school for the senior high schools in his city because	these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs.	8.338363236099541
15986. he prefers	to designate such schools as general high schools.	11.327381775397427
15987. the suburban	high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive	high school because of the absence of vocational programs.	8.366762718823512
15988. the reason	is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community.	22.180078139706808
15989. therefore	employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan	area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic	of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.	6.940883847572112
15990. the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities	must be reckoned as permanent institutions.	12.653240109836759
15991. by and large their programs	are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and	to the realities of the apprentice system.	7.866034842231976

16242. it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away.	26.06044606333272
16243. at the	base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot.	7.990140110483272
16244. the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks creepers and bushes so	thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called	ulyate answered from ten feet away.	7.005249651133594
16245. nice country to meet a lion in	face to face.	7.6132050038391395
16246. ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the	barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion till they	came out of breath to the crest and peering through the branches of	a bush this is what ulyate saw: jones who had apparently	ridden up the nearly impassable hillside sitting calmly on	his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness who was crouched	on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him while the	dogs whirled around her.	7.219248035653604
16247. ulyate drew back with a start and put	finger to lips almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her	off the dogs have got her bayed h.	6.159901339336745
16248. she's just the other side	of that bush! and when they had drawn back a step he added:	jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her.	6.828778215333757
16249. why she doesn't	charge him i don't know.	3.692014662443588
16250. and he hasn't even got a knife on	him.	9.602191624451697
16251. he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground h.	7.759161161073522
16252. jones had been about a hundred	and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the	reef.	12.24604552774408
16253. she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when	she saw him she rose to full height and roared opening her mouth wide	lashing her tail and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in	irritation as much as to say: how dare you disturb me in my sacred	precinct?	5.535725583476207
16254.    intuition told him however that she was tired	and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge yet.	10.260907242982443
16255. he	moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because	he knew the female is less predictable than the male.	5.167947988336493
16256. at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game	hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.	8.308705822012783
16257. of the thirty-four seventeen had been killed by lions and eleven out	she snarled terribly but intuition	told	him again that she was bluffing and he could see that half her	attention was distracted by the dogs.	6.437099484283399
16258. it was falling	over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front	of her on the rock.	11.358865923435738
16259. even then if she took one step forward he could	catch her.	9.775989934829457
16260. but john nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end	was as good as another to john africa arizona no matter- and she	changed ends and took a swipe at john but he ducked back.	6.9437051529754505
16261. jones	then recoiled his rope and threw again this time hitting her on	the back but failing to encircle her.	6.3496187227133545
16262. she whirled and faced him roaring	terribly and ulyate watching through the leaves could not understand	why she did not charge and obliterate him because he wouldn't	have much of a chance of getting away in that thick growth but she	seemed just a trace uncertain; while jones on the other hand appeared	perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.	7.845845652131133
16263. from the lioness' point of view this strange creature	on the back of another creature lashing out with its long thin paw	very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with.	6.704393668843356
16264. but	now she sank lower to the rock.	9.573032190237608
16265. her roar changed to a growl.	8.993329887230061
16266. her	tail	no longer lashed.	11.578948500819791
16267. although she appeared more subdued and defeated	jones knew she was growing more dangerous.	6.8574997634704165
16268. she was rested and could	mount a charge.	12.457143665522691
16269. just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched	and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.	7.354569781003435
16270. at this moment loveless and means arrived crashing through the undergrowth	with their horses and distracted her and she ran off a short	distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks.	9.387130964933968
16271. the dogs followed	her and she killed three and badly wounded old john.	7.871590569440627
16272. we've	got to get her out of there! jones yelled or she'll	kill 'em all.	4.610947517226406
16273. for such an	emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of	their equipment.	6.22533634711148
16274. lighting one he pitched it into the crevice and the	lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.	8.967732691166251
16275. ain't she	a beauty though?	5.410009235132086
16276.  called out means as she ran.	12.894942817465752
16277. don't	you go a step nearer her than i do jones warned and if	you do go at a run so you'll have momentum!   for two hours	they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of	the reef trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get	a good throw.	4.949725533624068
16278. but she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore	away.	15.618242498186069
16279. the dogs were tired.	15.105367286853784
16280. the men were tired too.	20.08812874809528
16281. it	was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again.	9.632013793480189
16282. and the sun was	beginning to go down.	14.52088353835247
16283. if dark came they would lose her.	11.350530663525563
16284. i'll	get a pole jones said finally and i'll poke a noose	over her	head!   at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like	aperture halfway down the reef.	4.847070709892742
16285. ulyate made no comment but his face	showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles	and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago not the gentler	ones of today and this one was angry with good reason.	6.055318503411357
16286. it won't work colonel.	9.560555144697519
16287. just the	same we'll try it.	6.802499559976257
16288. but without waiting for them to try it	she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain.	16.95392047549229
16289. john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out	behind many of them trailing blood.	7.799293467114854
16290. john himself was bruised and	clawed from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running	almost as strongly now as in the morning.	10.597394875180338
16291. she took refuge	on a tongue of land extending into a gully crouched at the base of a	thorn tree and waited for them to come up.	8.394077659363951
16292. she had chosen the spot well.	15.86941583843752
16293. with the gully on three sides she could be approached only along	the tongue of land.	8.067752749209408
16294. means	tried her first.	11.474347319461295
16295. very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding	edging closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to spin and	run rope whining about his head horse edging tensely under him but	the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close	proximity of the lion.	5.402348743302977
16296. they tell you horses go crazy at the sight	or smell of a bear or a lion but these didn't.	9.578935132122133

16301. with a whirling	jump it could get into gear h.	9.785180286378457
16302. however nothing on four legs	was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless	it was a cheetah.	10.15082970124969
16303. for thirty	yards she gained rapidly.	10.11213365317877
16304. she was closing and within one more bound	would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay but- and	here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they	were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound.	8.391884678655122
16305. means held	steady one jump ahead of her.	8.049144208155575
16306. then gradually he began to pull away.	15.010544731923758
16307. a western cowpony had outrun an african lion from a standing start.	6.897647488740075
16308. photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from means h.	8.89170298052548
16309. of course the factor of head start made all the difference.	11.850025305969071
16310. how much	head start?	15.836696771599565
16311.  no one knew exactly.	13.024529055474236
16312. that was the whole question.	20.246431444633018
16313. the lioness quickly changed front when	she saw she couldn't catch means and made for jones.	5.8332610982727156
16314. as she had	done with means she gained rapidly at first but then baldy began	to draw away.	10.84180126446848
16315. somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the	determining point.	9.1968653965474
16316. when jones too drew away she returned to	a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully crouched low	and waited as before.	9.037631100063095
16317. this new position however gave the ropers a	better chance.	8.62461319462269
16318. there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and	throw as you went.	14.298228321997849
16319. so: means edged around on the north side of her	jones moved in from the south.	7.883250213726207
16320. tossing his rope and shouting he attracted	her attention.	9.508128899630616
16321. he succeeded almost too well because once she	rose as if to charge and he half wheeled his horse- he was within	fifty feet- but she sank back.	5.377170751518045
16322. from behind her means shot	forward at a run.	11.387996486156993
16323. kearton began shouting wait wait- the camera's	jammed! but means kept on.	4.301523202058276
16324. he raced by within twenty feet	of her roped her around the neck but a lioness' neck is short and	thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off.	7.186814634869782
16325. the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was	once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies.	7.037975665206627
16326. but the time	came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was	looked upon as deficient in its essential life.	10.462014634766218
16327. the christian education	of children too was once hardly more than a sideshow but the day	came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church	school was thought of as failing in its duty.	6.416671848663619
16328. the most serious	weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally	regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination	and a few interdenominational executives.	13.605301954615248
16329. most pastors and laymen	even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical	movement lies outside the province of their parishes.	8.216311148653876
16330. they may	even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the	ecclesiastical rover boys as someone has dubbed them who like	to go to national and international assemblies and have expense accounts	that permit them to do so.	8.176322537428788
16331. as long as this point of view	prevails the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt.	10.158831850534893
16332. the next	stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.	14.405246166883229
16333. progress will take place far less through what is done in any	summit conference of the national council or the world council	or even in offices of the denominational boards than through what	happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors.	6.797333508359781
16334. the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping	congregations of different traditions exist side by side.	9.737871190962096
16335. until they	see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their	own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable	aspect of unreality.	8.970836831907352
16336. as things now stand there is a grievous disparity	between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings	and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main	street in the nation.	8.636486487162854
16337. the crux	of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation	between congregations in the same community.	7.391901927996329
16338. the decisive question	is what happens within each congregation and finally in the	minds and hearts of the individual members.	10.425161444713494
16339. it is here that the local	and ecumenical must meet.	15.089608536132811
16340. it is here that the ecumenical must become	local and the local become ecumenical.	17.84859167513159
16341. it has become almost	trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the	grass roots.	14.037830241110038
16342. this way of describing the matter is unfortunate.	16.189141502407278
16343. one is that whatever is ecumenical has	to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only	to be understood at the so-called lower levels.	6.021220373581243
16344. the truth however	is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its	own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god	throughout the world.	11.451570412241686
16345. the other misconception is that our ecumenical	problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide	extension and its interdenominational connections now comprehended	by many national leaders can be communicated to all congregations.	7.132668874234356
16346. however needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information	but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ	in the world.	12.238252208806722
16347. the basic unit in the church of whatever denominational	polity is always the congregation.	10.427397740212148
16348. it is hardly possible	to emphasize this too much.	19.268396116867844
16349. most people do not realize that the congregation	as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally	sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience	in daily relationships with one another is unique.	7.388606272503966
16350. the idea that it	is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.	14.184817686790497
16351. the jewish synagogue	affords a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism	buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they	have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of	prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and	love.	6.255761148493475
16352. their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an	altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with	a distinctive kind of fellowship.	10.444480106097242
16353. how far the fellowship in most	local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia!	what is now called christian fellowship is often little more	than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind	of people one likes.	6.551770518509034
16354. the koinonia of acts and of the epistles	means sharing in a common relation to christ.	10.985926063637448
16355. it is an experience of	a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate	indwelling of christ in his people.	9.588142424037093
16356. as dietrich bonho^ffer puts	it our community with one another consists solely in what christ	has done to both of us.	8.75893707940107
16357. this may mean having fellowship in the church	with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness	we might prefer not to have any association at all.	8.150819263853599
16358. there is a vast	difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament	describes and the community of congeniality found in the average	church building.	13.667697723019009
16359. whenever a congregation really sees itself	as a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole	body of christ and participating in his mission to the world a necessary	foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid.	6.719815004069258
16360. the	antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists.	10.976114657093325
16361. the	local and the ecumenical are one.	8.423777107012082
16362. of course the perspective	of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the	people of god will always be different from the perspective of those	who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a	particular place.	10.299154859581355
16363. each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related	to the other.	8.39289896463281
16364. neither is adequate if it stands alone.	14.503433483277615
16365. our difficulty	arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other.	6.7721203046304
16366. and this is what	all too often happens.	17.51898010896618
16367. a little parable	illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor	bela vasady at the end of the second world war.	8.073894382910748
16368. with great	difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew	his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world	council of churches.	11.179247702950585
16369. when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles	his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new	ones.	8.415755363912703
16370. he often spoke of them as his ecumenical	glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is	required in the church.	11.870943601370978
16371. it is he said a bifocal vision which can	see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right	relation to both.	7.332985702350621
16372. as things stand now the local and the ecumenical	tend to compete with each other.	12.071444842999705
16373. on the one hand there are	ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter	with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church	is doing in their own town.	10.453894429901297
16374. they do not escape the pitfall into which	charles dickens pictured mrs jellyby as falling.	11.057626131853606
16375. her concern	for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite	forgot and neglected her son peepy! likewise the ecumenist may become	so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian	state in east germany the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary	china and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south	africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its	unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship pastoral service	and counseling and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.	5.618969229622126
16376. on the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering	to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation	that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social	responsibility and world mission.	10.92718854663019
16377. as a result they go on thinking	of the church with introverted and self-centered satisfaction only	in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families.	9.123653721062515
16378. it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of	the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual	concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the	members.	9.440421856563459
16379. the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or	the world.	9.267803278419384
16380. the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the	parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable	suburbs.	10.818336698474068
16381. it is eminently successful according to all conventional	standards.	13.958793208896413
16382. it is growing in numbers.	27.296587927923017
16383. its people are agreeable	friends.	11.256602114850528
16384. it has a beautiful edifice.	27.212020739380648
16385. its preaching and its music give	refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain.	7.086931072003241
16386. it	provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled.	10.881995148531663
16387. it helps children	grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible.	9.59322189637908
16388. it draws	young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the	church from generation to generation.	14.32363584281179
16389. and it is easy for the ecumenical	enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.	12.714627503645753
16390. but what	is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians	in the world?	9.884704535991448
16391.  all too often its conception of parish ministry	and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation	to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.	7.887970511761865
16392. it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with	the mind of christ.	13.548466532782973
16393. it is not helping them face the moral crisis	involved in the use of nuclear energy.	12.360544826497717
16394. it is not making them sensitive	to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial	life.	12.617879785827608
16395. it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship	means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world	to economically underdeveloped peoples.	9.48980322924141
16396. it is not developing an awareness	of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young	churches emerge in asia and africa.	13.288073535480395
16397. to put it bluntly many	a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want.	7.870976044524912
16398. it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility	in relation to the world.	15.05266551085761
16399. we shall not make a decisive advance	in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not	merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness	and mission to the world.	8.319359395961765
16400. there is a humorous but revealing	story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted	to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant	community.	12.372052478926856
16401. he built a school and a library then a recreation center	and an inn.	7.734410936917724
16402. desiring to fill the only remaining lack he selected	the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting	it.	8.106224424779205
16403. a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired do	you belong to this church mr rancher?	7.550108018523296
16404.  why no ma'am	he replied this church belongs to me! the story reflects	the way too many people feel.	7.081664889288214
16405. as long as the congregation regards	the church as our church or the minister thinks of it as my	church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant	advance.	8.862699878659853
16406. there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs	not to us but to christ and that it is his purpose not our own interests	and preferences that determines what it is to be and do.	14.675148172727514
16407. embodiment of the whole	a local church which conceives its function	to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and	concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an	extra not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church.	6.406367185452068
16408. it would	doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical	it is really failing to be the church of christ.	12.503027524669278
16409. yet the	truth according to the new testament is that every local church	has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in	that particular place.	7.4434505787030245
16410. yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match	the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging	fords kept gathering all morning until the edges of the field	were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field	to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking	young man with the only baseball cap.	7.4982231594007835
16411. this was a bitterly	fought game carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight with no	friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness	that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls	that went into the crowd.	6.393791110754357
16412. every pitch in the game brought forth	a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors	dropped	called forth yelps of derision.	7.991424246206496
16413. at	one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting	as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in	the kidneys he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled	over whether the ball was dead or the base runners were	free to score.	7.0181090652532525
16414. this was typical of such games which were earnestly	played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of	good fellowship.	9.841920703696038
16415. when the visitors after losing this game rode along	the village streets toward home the youngsters who could keep abreast	of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly you bunch of	hay-shakers! g'ahn back home! you hay-shakers!   baseball	was surely the national game in those days even though professional	baseball may have been merely a business.	5.8034858276065435
16416. radio broadcasts had	not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home	in the town park or a pasture with perhaps two or three trips to the	city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or	the red sox.	8.512674235816254
16417. young men in school could look forward to playing	ball for money in a dozen different places even if they failed to	make the major leagues.	7.460822122127664
16418. nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might	find a payday awaiting him in the three i league or the pony	league or the coastal plains league or the fast eastern league	if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.	9.774295706479059
16419. even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams	sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores	that played two or three times a week throughout the summer usually in	the cool of the evening before an earnest and partisan audience who	did not begrudge a quarter each or even more to be dropped into a hat	when the game was half over.	6.2768256815739605
16420. babe ruth of course was everyone's	hero and everyone knew him even though relatively few ever	saw him play ball.	7.8002077151583515
16421. his face was always in the newspapers sometimes	in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life.	8.283835692970824
16422. as the twenties grew	older and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more	and more people daily in the doings of the professionals the great	hitters overshadowed the game so that pitchers	were nearly of no account.	8.8593783581084
16423. boys no longer bothered learning to	bunt and even school kids scorned to choke up on a bat as willie	keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.	5.81212037320786
16424. other	hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared	to dream of matching ruth who was still called jidge by all his	friends or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him	and who called most	of the world kid.	7.380278746145103
16425. lou gehrig was given the nickname buster	and he ran ruth a close race in home runs.	6.675771130152306
16426. but the nickname never	stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in color- which is sometimes	a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field.	8.454178441312786
16427. ruth	was a delinquent boy still but he was in every way a great ball	player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone	to do it.	6.8159030476167395
16428. a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities	with the encouragement of the press so that they might	see their names in big black print along with daddy browning's	al capone's earl sande's and the prince of wales'.	7.064834683483878
16429. one	who for a time succeeded	best and was still the sorriest of all was charles	arthur shires who called himself in the newspapers art the	great or the great shires.	7.3298610440225636
16430. it was his brag that he could beat	everybody at anything but especially at fighting and he once took on	the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.	10.04561371750622
16431. he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;	and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles	in art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first	baseman for some forgotten reason.	6.294650494180136
16432. pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated	the sorry fact about this young man who was barely	of age when he broke into major-league baseball was that he really	was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so	good as he claimed and always an irritant to his associates but a	good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate	on his skills or cut up in public.	7.20053650746578
16433. in his minor way charles	arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was for	he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these	scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers.	6.53787398036895
16434. there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;	or who ingested strange objects like live fish; or who undertook	to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor with or without	a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without	pausing for breath.	6.530477599672978
16435. one young man exhilarated to the point of insanity	by liquor and the excitement of the moment performed a perfect	swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army	football game landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below	and died at once.	7.3687165558768175
16436. but the twenties were not all insanity and	a striving after recognition.	11.87298161878312
16437. the business of baseball began to prosper	along with other entertainments and performers- thanks partly to	george herman ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his	salary higher and higher- prospered too.	4.551702200350061
16438. while fifty years before	albert goodwill spalding secretary of the chicago ball club of	the national league could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo	club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball	game in august in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium	might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate.	9.045419179549766
16439. and	while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox- all of them	top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy charles	comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five	hundred dollars a year stars now were asking ten thousand dollars	twenty thousand dollars yes even fifty thousand dollars a season.	4.05876691518831
16440. the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new	york yankees bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club	by men named ed barrow and miller huggins.	8.370629652105574
16441. boston fans sometimes	liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the	great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox- sold to millionaires	huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most	trifling desire.	6.511679481027875
16442. ruth himself still owning his farm in massachusetts	and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed	his round boyish face on the wrappers had led the parade down from fenway	park followed by pitchers carl mays leslie joe bush	waite hoyt herb pennock and sam jones catcher wally schang	third baseman joe dugan	and shortstop everett scott.	6.9893799219827475
16443. by 1926 when	the mighty yanks were at their mightiest only a few of these were	left but they still shone brightest even beside able and agile rookies	like tony lazzeri	mark koenig lou gehrig george pipgras and	gray-thatched earl combs.	5.454891677976275
16444. the deeds of this team through two seasons	and in the two world's series that followed have been written	and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said.	8.38841413669932
16445. but there	is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in	the cheap seats for one world's series game in 1926 like best to	recall.	5.900909160265356
16446. babe ruth as he always did in the stadium played right field	to avoid having the sun in his eyes and tommy thevenow a rather	mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st louis cardinals	knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the	permanent stands and the wooden bleachers where ruth could not reach	it.	7.761553809406232
16447. the ball lay there shining white on the grass in view of nearly	every fan in the park while ruth red-necked with frustration charged	about the small patch of ground screaming where's the -ing	ball?	5.444552311428612
16448.  but as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over	not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me so little tommy	ran all the way home.	10.916023021383236
16449. the ordinary man and woman however saw	little of the great professional games of those golden days or of	any other sporting event for that matter.	6.711272805487305
16450. promoters always hastened	to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators	and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in	with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest	of any importance.	10.589429209219775
16451. radio broadcasts however- now that even plain	people could afford loud speakers on their sets- held old	fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones chiefly women	who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition	became first inured then attracted then addicted to the long	afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.	4.4353715961747255
16452. in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on	weekends the announcer was silenced and fans must needs drive to the	city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.	9.199580430123877
16453. this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well	as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies some of which began	to offer special excursion rates including seats at the park just	as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.	5.984415576185764
16454. while women had always attended ball games in small numbers	part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth	century to be taken out to the ball park and to root root root for	they had often sat in patient martyrdom unable even to	read the scoreboard which sometimes seemed to indicate that one	team	led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and	fifty-one.	9.099935639370416
16455. the questions women asked at baseball games were standard	grist for amateur comedy as were the doings of women automobile drivers;	for every grown man	knew at least the fundamentals of baseball just	as every male american in this era liked to imagine that	he could fight with his fists.	5.621230503898896
16456. and women were not expected to know	that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball.	11.518432508628603
16457. radio however so increased the interest of women in the game	that it was hardly necessary even to have ladies' days any longer	to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.	6.291520710915157
16458. women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands where	they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice	stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.	7.3498431656619445
16459. the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative	despite the baseball jargon that girls and women could begin to	store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics	that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their	lessons in school.	6.104122256581822
16460. this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores	will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal	and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for	preserving the ideal.	7.855891188488127
16461. our discussion of this involves using	erik erikson's schema of identity vs identity diffusion	as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto	the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers	from whose case histories we quoted earlier.	4.8305122033520105
16462. our discussion does not	utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson but is intended	to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying	unwed mothers.	7.968427574104846
16463. we hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological	standpoint the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous	long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy	through adolescence.	6.609772232754614
16464. hypothesizing a series of developmental	stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old	age erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series	of identity crises.	7.992131857946995
16465. the successful and positive resolution of these	crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during	adolescence the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity	crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having	resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy	childhood and early adolescence.	4.712238449768616
16466. within erikson's schema the	adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case her unwed motherhood-	reflects her identity diffusion or her inability to resolve	these various identity crises positively.	5.455701767662452
16467. the adolescent	experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs time diffusion.	8.89979027935351
16468. time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and	to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range	objectives- is more easily developed if from infancy on the individual	has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which	she lives.	9.482616935822483
16469. erikson has noted that unless this trust developed early	the time ambivalence experienced in varying degree and temporarily	by all adolescents	gratification of wants during childhood while not yet having fully	may develop	into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.	5.9049701801345655
16470. experience of this time	diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate	urgency to act immediately.	9.946925617442188
16471. these polar extremes in time	diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported	in earlier chapters.	7.216065066074793
16472. some of these mothers apparently feeling a	desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love	and sex that would have life-long consequences.	9.728397616983603
16473. others displayed	utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.	7.051935022659766
16474. for many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life	and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources	of their	basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in	general.	10.302642249098229
16475. however as erickson has noted the individual's	failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood	need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of	identity diffusion in his adolescence.	5.738361766968602
16476. and as shown in chapter	6 some snp females originally developed such trust only	during their adolescence through the aid of and their identification	with alter-parents.	10.112974397050982
16477. in the specific case of time diffusion we	must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust	when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by	most adolescents in our society and with the failure of	the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.	8.017759047961025
16478. the adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty	vs an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation	vs negative identity.	5.489853316854487
16479. a sense of self-certainty and the freedom	to experiment with different roles or confidence in one's own unique	behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity is more easily	developed during adolescence if during early childhood the individual	was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some	autonomy.	4.5936027969867
16480. however if the child has been constantly surrounded	during nursery and early school age by peer groups; inculcated	with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed	little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence	her normal degree of vanity sensitivity and preoccupation with	whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable will be compounded.	6.171417575076196
16481. her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions	and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence	are the manifestations in her adolescence of her having been indoctrinated	in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave	in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her nursery-	and elementary-school peer friends.	5.508832798333107
16482. to be different is to invite	shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's	parents who already consider one different and difficult to understand	than by one's peers who are also experiencing a similar groping	for and denial of adult status.	6.669067741636381
16483. the attitudes of some unwed	mothers quoted in chapter 2 revealed both considerable preoccupation	with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.	6.906184184329498
16484. many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable	means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but	very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need	to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and	with one's self.	6.941762742496533
16485. another identity crisis confronting the	adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs work-paralysis.	7.718517358581531
16486. the adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise	the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends	on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy initiative and	self-discipline during childhood.	7.376045596144672
16487. the developmental process involves	the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement	resulting from having completed tasks having kept commitments	and having created something	dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought	.	5.04319331051606
16488. these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty	that the adolescent needs for experimenting with many roles and	for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and	discovering her skills and abilities.	9.542562199610305
16489. if she has not had such	experiences the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will	be compounded.	6.83777167834392
16490. she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted	with present and future alternatives- eg whether to prepare	primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether	to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself	while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a	job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and	to follow this or that course of study.	6.945090111934343
16491. erikson has noted that as	this indecision mounts it may result in a paralysis of workmanship.	8.469775784447068
16492. this paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and	never completing- many jobs tasks and courses of study; and in	the fact that she bases her decisions about work college carreer and	studies on what others are doing rather than on her own sense of identity	with given skills abilities likes and dislikes.	6.668016598585479
16493. the absence	during her childhood and early adolescence of experiences in developing	the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences	that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement-	and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy	and initiative in play and expression both tend in her adolescence	to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally	in experimenting.	4.664662626837857
16494. the comments made by some unwed mothers	reflect this paralysis of workmanship.	11.176767227145952
16495. they	attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions	others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available	convenient and paid reasonably.	5.92484823063216
16496. these things both express and	at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion	in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and	self-certainty.	10.390353334890918
16497. as their identity diffusion increased they became more	susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.	6.893787639663325
16498. these	affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities	containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship	no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.	9.890946190693962
16499. childhood	experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context	of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance	for the prevention of illegitimacy.	5.836847435219213
16500. the excerpts from case histories	presented above confirm this significance though through different	facets of experience.	8.47475843321377
16501. for example some unwed mothers had had no work	experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood	and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours	in searching for something exciting and diverting.	6.263358787656298
16502. on	the other hand some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility	imposed on them at an early age and had thus had so little freedom	or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that their work	and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped	and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden	sexual behavior.	8.636907454871283
16503. the adolescent also faces the identity	crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs diffusion	of ideals.	6.65692607548865
16504. in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations	for the prevention of illegitimacy we shall again superimpose	erikson's concept on our data.	9.25294837774679
16505. adolescents have a much-discussed	tendency to polarize ideas and values to perceive things as	either-or black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively	unimportant.	4.349666018779173
16506. this tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the	literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents.	9.277304664275166
16507. erikson	has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily	resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly	changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.	4.9722852619076345
16508. it provides identification- with an idea a value a cause that	cuts through or even transcends the multiple and ambivalent identities	of their passage from child to adult and permits their forceful	and overt expression of emotion.	7.816052503252231
16509. the positive development during	adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with	increasing independence and to identify overtly either with or against	given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree	on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy	initiative and self-certainty.	6.01079442690139
16510. most adolescents have some ideological	diffusion at various developmental stages as they experience a proliferation	of ideas and values.	9.403465120608875
16511. the diffusion is most pronounced and	most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very	minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could	have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources	of developing self-certainty.	7.212510503756277
16512. a pronounced ideological	diffusion- ie inability to identify independently with given	ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways.	6.740654398932005
16513. for example	it is evinced by the adolescent whose beliefs and actions	represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior	patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice.	5.9450242423397945
16514. it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans whose ideas and	behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide	with those of the individual or group present and most important	at the moment.	10.231453344368827
16515. in another sense it is represented in the arguments	of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all	other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.	7.609691299656269
16516. the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological	diffusion embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify	independently with a given value system or behavior pattern and	her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility	for her sexual behavior.	7.327498226241478
16517. for example the unwed mothers expressed	their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what	it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly.	7.54303928756995
16518. they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital	sexual intercourse.	11.51900949294187
16519. they condemned the movie script writers for implying	that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.	6.786423499459681
16520. they criticized parents	for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong;	and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive	or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant.	7.612019410693094
16521. in the adult world there are a number of rather general and	diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the	adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.	7.031233487509647
16522. for example some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good	guys and the bad guys to portray the weak people as heroes and	weakness as a virtue and to explain asocial behavior	by attributing it to deterministic psychological familial and social	experiences.	8.332295885371337
16523. in the final accounting these would have augmented the bill for both	sides.	9.589650924954494
16524. an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.	11.435307471681337
16525. yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation	which many regarded as wasteful indirectly contributed to constructive	changes in legal procedure.	7.537922403877414
16526. the duration and other circumstances	of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of	patent infringement actions.	10.174739338924699
16527. the suit as we have seen came before	the courts when patent attorneys inventors and laymen were making mounting	demands for reforms in the american patent system.	6.722750615173332
16528. chief among	the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures	in equity.	8.206512508863621
16529. in a long and angry footnote to his opinion	judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.	8.364244935627285
16530. it is a duty said hough not to let pass this opportunity	of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony	in equity current in this circuit excused	if not justified by the rules of the supreme court especially to	be found in patent causes and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.	9.963675744965627
16531. as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition	rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer	i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged and expensive	prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity.	6.747527855346422
16532. observing	that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible	examples hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing	procedures.	8.07914162823717
16533. he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case	record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous	squabbles over minor matters; the objections stated at outrageous	length; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts uncalled	for and	unjustifiable from the retort discourteous to the lie direct.	4.284450932278154
16534. the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was	a striking example concluded hough will	remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial	officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline	and the reception or exclusion of testimony.	9.155042598480257
16535. not least	among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment	were those who had participated in the selden suit.	10.078938691317187
16536. william a	redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under	rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty	days instead of five years.	10.426245968755527
16537. inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for	reform inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a horrible	example.	5.978570940090437
16538. its costive deliberations were likened to those of	the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in	bleak house.	6.977846948773254
16539. parker who agreed with much of this criticism	did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects.	6.7864756166226226
16540. but	he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried.	12.268623670128012
16541. in a detailed	letter published in the scientific american in 1912 he	remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding	of the facts.	7.740919906905368
16542. the suit although commonly designated as a single	action actually embraced five cases.	9.753390568553003
16543. parker insisted that the size	of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable	duplication of testimony.	7.90496955962293
16544. in a private communication written	in 1911 parker had been more to the point.	12.629946965608758
16545. noting the complaints	of inventors and members of the patent bar he admitted that some	of the strictures were fairly well founded but he added that under	existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group	of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent.	6.566610391837957
16546. the	vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit as well as the	complex character of the automotive art encouraged both sides to exploit	every possible chance for or against the patent said parker.	11.006758862436785
16547. this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases and	of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the	record beyond what ordinarily would occur.	8.013398843766158
16548. parker listed the	remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony.	9.518577029793974
16549. the most important of these found him in agreement with hough's	plea for reform.	7.758969850626631
16550. parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate	or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court	who had no authority to limit testimony.	8.645367620575058
16551. the taking of depositions	he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner empowered	to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial	testimony.	6.391175829219989
16552. i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power	existed and this course been pursued it would have shortened	the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of	the other witnesses thereto more than that.	9.988338936635245
16553. in the end hough's	acidulous protest which parker called the now somewhat famous	note on this 'selden' case did not go unheeded.	6.571057957936909
16554. in 1912	the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity	which became effective on february 1 1913.	10.508768482225488
16555. the revised procedure	was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform.	6.9816416087549955
16556. under the new rules testimony	is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary	character.	10.891819695511984
16557. other expeditious methods are designed to prevent	prolixity limit delays and reduce the expense of infringement suits.	7.231071486731392
16558. one of the alam lawyers observed that if the selden	case had been tried under this simplified procedure the testimony	which filled more than a score of volumes at a minimum cost of $1	a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume.	9.880884703360389
16559. while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive	forms of litigation these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums	of money.	6.098155256461476
16560. there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme	court as a direct result of the selden patent suit.	19.573755376103172
16561. even	before it was formally dissolved in 1912 the alam	was succeeded by the automobile board of trade the direct lineal	ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association.	5.861318134284759
16562. the trade bodies which came in the wake of the alam	were more representative for they never adopted a policy of exclusion.	11.540209355941656
16563. nevertheless it is from the selden organization that the industry	inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests	of the trade.	7.031497271209269
16564. one of the chief features of this community of interest	is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement a milestone	in the development of american industrial cooperation.	10.486404960001082
16565. its origin	lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath.	8.021998828796333
16566. from	the earliest days of the motor car industry before the alam	was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and	vexing problem.	9.430999266650087
16567. many patent contests were waged over automobile components	and accessories among them tires detachable rims ball bearings	license brackets and electric horns.	5.334466020718225
16568. the fluidity and momentum of	the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims.	8.611713794226592
16569. as	early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with	the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers.	5.6815737875269425
16570. this scheme failed and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement	suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest	in 1912.	9.622685930768325
16571. in this tangle of conflicting claims the patent-sharing	scheme adopted by the alam at its founding proved	to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant	litigation.	6.033003569685136
16572. the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty	eliminated infringement suits among the members of the alam	patent pool	and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive	technology.	8.623510287083166
16573. one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition	upon the withholding of patent rights among alam members.	11.33687519047583
16574. within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics	of a cross-licensing agreement.	7.978512844824278
16575. its positive features	outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.	8.236279704438742
16576. since the alam holdings embraced only about twenty-five	per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent	companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors	of the industry.	7.067330904553426
16577. the highly important dyer patents on the sliding	gear transmission were held by the alam pool.	7.364365067815608
16578. but henry	ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier	cars and in 1905 as a precautionary measure took out a license	from the man who claimed to be its inventor.	8.65463561485411
16579. for those affiliated	with it the alam pool was a haven from the infringement	actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting	intensity after 1900.	7.678105673424325
16580. by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases	many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions.	8.288347063109688
16581. it was commonplace for auto makers parts-suppliers and dealers	to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their	daily mail.	6.772146292464967
16582. purely from the business man's standpoint and without	regard to the lawyer's view commented a trade journal the	matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing	some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents	are to become weapons of warfare in business instead of simple beneficient	protection devices for encouraging inventive creation.	6.439926717648698
16583. occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain	prospect of legal complications.	6.625305253214521
16584. one manufacturer who held an allegedly	basic patent said: i would readily put over $50000 into the	manufacture of the device but it is so easy to make that we would enter	immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would	eat up all our profits.	7.7153520350078635
16585. the prevailing view in the industry was	summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee:	the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions	including delays surrounding legal disputes particularly in patent	litigation are items of industrial burden which must be written	large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste.	6.310317613996481
16586. by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping	constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical	information.	9.363278547889548
16587. at this point charles c hanch long an advocate	of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee	of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor	to the automobile board of trade.	8.259699167604781
16588. hanch was treasurer of the nordyke	+ marmon company an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling	machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904.	6.038832787886147
16589. he had	first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety	per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's.	7.558315906796145
16590. anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry	hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading	alam members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.	7.565380599795617
16591. the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal but hanch	did not abandon his scheme.	7.745568659149648
16592. after the demise of the alam	the time was propitious for establishing such a pool.	10.465798660947966
16593. most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal	interchange of patents.	7.108551317085553
16594. it is a much easier course to agree to	let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned said	a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of straightening	the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system	which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day.	9.578803032200444
16595. with the other members of the patents committee- wilfred c leland	howard e coffin windsor t white and w h	vandervoort- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential	feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution.	4.529021382779922
16596. the	plan was supported by frederick p fish counsel for the national	automobile chamber of commerce.	8.973901781112364
16597. it will be recalled that in his	summation for the alam before judge hough fish had	condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial	community.	9.561153790053462
16598. he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used	their patents solely for nuisance value.	11.040537394572079
16599. my personal view is that	not one patented invention in ten is worth making he later told	a congressional committee.	6.262301590660403
16600. the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed	the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.	14.012170864821433
16601. drawn up in 1914 the cross-licensing agreement became	effective in 1915.	6.2934324625338
16602. it remained in force for ten years and has been	renewed at five-year intervals since 1925.	10.67637636725003

16636. the sense of perspective has been created by designing the	length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade	are much shorter than those in front.	10.671815522811924
16637. the gardens of the palazzo	shaded by a huge magnolia tree are most attractive.	8.387656866392227

16652. from the seventeenth to	the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in	the summer and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated	square in their carriages.	8.955479917621108
16653. giovanni bernini's fountain	of the rivers in the center of the piazza is built around	a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes	and rocks with four huge figures one at each corner denoting four	great rivers from different continents- the danube the ganges the	nile and the plate.	4.955095003578674
16654. the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered	perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure	from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant' agnese	in agone the work of bernini's rival borromini.	9.162781032396335

16665. as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the	temple of isis you will admire the pantheon's impressive corinthian	columns.	6.645251378781306
16666. the pantheon's interior still in its original	form is truly majestic and an architectural triumph.	7.383934009069197

16668. the only means of interior light is the	twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous standing	before the tomb of raphael the great genius of the renaissance when	shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple you are	once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of	rome.	7.639304015203583
16669. as you leave the pantheon take the narrow street to	the right the via del seminario a block to	one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city.	7.730281167870754
16670. there about one hundred yards on your right you pass a simple restaurant	the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church	seems like a stage set.	10.126413373426516
16671. this is one of the most charming little	squares in this part of rome.	16.205622035699747
16672. one block along the via de burro	will bring you to the in	the old a few yards farther on the via	dei bergamaschi is the the great column from	which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus	aurelius.	9.38278443930139

16674. horse races took place here in the middle	ages.	11.953513081953675

16676. here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where	the family still lives.	13.80743334402261

16680. rare indeed is the harlem citizen from the most circumspect church	member to the most shiftless adolescent who does not have a long tale	to tell of police incompetence injustice or brutality.	9.673531725137
16681. i myself	have witnessed and endured it more than once.	8.659680031958736
16682. the businessmen and racketeers	also have a story.	11.698528758062398
16683. and so do the prostitutes.	15.341874504367825
16684. perhaps the place to discuss harlem's very complex attitude toward	black policemen nor the reasons according to harlem that they	it is hard on the other hand to blame	the policeman blank good-natured thoughtless and insuperably	innocent for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.	8.614790359952908
16685. he too believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended	when they are not taken for the deed.	7.889588318869444
16686. he has never himself done	anything for which to be hated- which of us has?	10.646119693859799
16687. - and yet he is	facing daily and nightly people who would gladly see him dead and he	knows it.	4.788199951401618
16688. there is no way for him not to know it: there are few things	under heaven more unnerving than the silent accumulating contempt	and hatred of a people.	10.532366768058797
16689. he moves through harlem therefore like	an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely	what and where he is and is the reason he walks in twos and threes.	6.559958532777114
16690. and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company:	the people who are watching him know why too.	12.13682294007848
16691. any street meeting	sacred or secular which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as	its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white	domination.	5.711603003337824
16692. and these days of course in terms increasingly vivid and	jubilant it speaks of the end of that domination.	15.488972149651364
16693. the white policeman	standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center	of the revolution now occurring in the world.	7.5238823023180075
16694. he is not prepared	for it- naturally nobody is- and what is possibly much more to the	point he is exposed as few white people are to the anguish of the	black people around him.	8.156661726862808
16695. even if he is gifted with the merest mustard	grain of imagination something must seep in.	8.787704200584434
16696. he cannot avoid observing	that some of the children in spite of their color remind him of	children he has known and loved perhaps even of his own children.	11.405936341742642
16697. he	knows that he certainly does not want his children living this	way.	7.444252861133054
16698. he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into	a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature.	8.666937717582488
16699. he becomes more	callous the population becomes more hostile the situation grows	more tense and the police force is increased.	7.1538886224086635
16700. one day to everyone's	astonishment someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything	blows up.	9.098916390466654
16701. before the dust has settled or the blood congealed editorials	speeches and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land demanding	to know what happened.	6.156962439691285
16702. what happened is that negroes want to	be treated like men.	12.748251477644176
16703. negroes want to be treated like men:	a perfectly straightforward statement containing only seven words.	6.049649351116119
16704. people who have mastered kant hegel shakespeare marx freud	and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable.	9.595692431143254
16705. the idea seems	to threaten profound barely conscious assumptions.	9.038047454567664
16706. a kind of panic	paralyzes their features as though they found themselves trapped on	the edge of a steep place.	10.675165757602544
16707. i once tried to describe to a very well-known	american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south.	7.697755575927987
16708. my recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me	in perfect innocence why don't all the negroes in the south	move north?	6.341027120816836
16709.  i tried to explain what has happened unfailingly	whenever a significant body of negroes move north.	7.948989472074183
16710. they do not	escape jim crow: they merely encounter another not-less-deadly	variety.	9.270338559801774
16711. they do not move to chicago they move to the south side;	they do not move to new york they move to harlem.	10.715154518415648
16712. the pressure	within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand and this expansion	is always violent.	9.204218301923378
16713. white people hold the line as long as they can	and in as many ways as they can from verbal intimidation to physical	violence.	8.309006980433969
16714. but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from	the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto.	14.121877582272493
16715. the white	people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make	a tidy profit by raising the rent chopping up the rooms and all but	dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood	turns into a turf.	4.903475857507462
16716. this is precisely what happened when the puerto	ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused	is as i write being fought out all up and down those streets.	10.162547956544904
16717. northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury.	8.010677057019503
16718. they seem	to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil	war and won they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going	on in the south without taking any responsibility for it; and	that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what	is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse.	9.283043139325548
16719. well in the	first place it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both	to know which is worse.	9.34585780895107
16720. i know negroes who prefer the south and	white southerners because at least there you haven't got to	play any guessing games! the guessing games referred to have driven	more than one negro into the narcotics ward the madhouse or the	river.	6.9116267640350735
16721. i know another negro a man very dear to me who says with	conviction and with truth the spirit of the south is the spirit	of america.	9.541398252865465
16722. he was born in the north and did his military training	in the south.	17.78354223438537
16723. he did not as far as i can gather find the south	worse; he found it if anything all too familiar.	9.412321036132369
16724. in the	second place though even if birmingham is worse no doubt	johannesburg south africa beats it by several miles and buchenwald	was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history	of the world.	9.793844261493371
16725. the world has never lacked for horrifying examples;	but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification	for our own crimes.	8.70714045770744
16726. this perpetual justification empties	the heart of all human feeling.	11.917835457511986
16727. the emptier our hearts become the greater	will be our crimes.	7.4652014571246355
16728. thirdly the south is not merely an embarrassingly	backward region but a part of this country and what happens	there concerns every one of us.	13.631482338684165
16729. as far as the color problem	is concerned there is but one great difference between the southern	white and the northerner: the southerner remembers historically and	in his own psyche a kind of eden in which he loved black people and	they loved him.	7.705149199078905
16730. historically the flaming sword laid across this eden	is the civil war.	9.329498646125272
16731. personally it is the southerner's sexual	coming of age when without any warning unbreakable taboos are set	up between himself and his past.	6.42514324459996
16732. everything thereafter is permitted	him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need.	9.755230550803025
16733. the resulting	indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the	basis of the southern hysteria.	6.941630452826093
16734. none of this is true for the	northerner.	23.69895553758564
16735. negroes represent nothing to him personally except perhaps	the dangers of carnality.	7.051832516123857
16736. southerners	see them all the time.	11.429104713008485
16737. northerners never think about them whereas southerners	are never really thinking of anything else.	6.5430432310083315
16738. negroes are	therefore ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south	and suffer hideously in both places.	9.507275566583335
16739. neither the southerner nor	the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man.	9.339041520118013
16740. it seems	to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be	considered either as a kind of ward	negroes comparatively bought cadillacs last year and how few	comparatively	or as a victim	that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our	.	9.525191551220862
16741. they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change-	cannot change- until the north changes.	8.54437325168354
16742. the country will	not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really	means by freedom.	8.75323150699103
16743. in the meantime generations keep being born bitterness	is increased by incompetence pride and folly and the world shrinks	around us.	8.171513787794865
16744. it is a terrible an inexorable law that one	cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own:	in the face of one's victim one sees oneself.	6.680580064801007
16745. walk through the	streets of harlem and see what we this nation have become.	7.92095447022555
16746. river downtown: postscript to a letter from harlem	the	fact that american negroes rioted in the un while adlai	stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white	americans.	7.54316851834322
16747. stevenson's speech and the spectacular disturbance	in the gallery were both touched off by the death in katanga the	day before of patrice lumumba.	6.244229714530587
16748. stevenson stated in the course of	his address that the united states was against colonialism.	15.868843454152193
16749. god	knows what the african nations who hold 25 per cent of the voting	stock in the un were thinking- they may for example have	been thinking of the us abstention when the vote on algerian	freedom was before the assembly- but i think i have a fairly accurate	notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking.	7.138682835275988
16750. i had	intended to be there myself.	17.55476222844703
16751. it was my first reaction upon hearing	of lumumba's death.	10.530976087688774
16752. i was curious about the impact of this political	assassination on negroes in harlem for lumumba had- has- captured	the popular imagination there.	9.143166872849408
16753. i was curious to know if lumumba's	death which is surely among the most sinister of recent events	would elicit from our side anything more than the usual well-meaning	rhetoric.	7.131350438626059
16754. and i was curious about the african reaction.	19.62290824624238
16755. however the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the un	gallery.	8.424641968584671
16756. had i been there i too in the eyes of most americans	would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists.	14.348920736391658
16757. the	climate and the events of the last decade and the steady pressure of	the cold war have given americans yet another means of avoiding	self-examination and so it has been decided that the riots were communist	inspired.	6.757133735720712
16758. nor was it long naturally before prominent	negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the un rioters	do not represent the real feeling of the negro community.	9.272823080834163
16759. according then to what i take to be the prevailing view these rioters	were merely a handful of irresponsible stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.	9.488053076927152
16760. i find this view amazing.	19.966351881054884
16761. it is a view which even	a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict.	10.995845650985473
16762. one	has only for example to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions.	10.043982608179213
16763. the first question is: would i like to live here?	8.254736393406281
16764. 	and the second question is: why don't those who now live here move	out?	4.98625210666811
16765.  the answer to both questions is immediately obvious.	14.23522331113696
16766. unless	one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that negroes	are somehow different from white people i do not see how one can	escape the conclusion that the negro's status in this country is	not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.	6.856760372611689
16767. now	i do not doubt that among the people at the un that day there	were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the	most cynical motives.	6.776756984286342
16768. wherever there is great social discontent these	people are sooner or later to be found.	9.39264662708876
16769. their presence is not as	frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity.	6.480285275370291
16770. what	i find appalling- and really dangerous- is the american assumption	that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical	agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.	7.682259114560492
16771. it is a notion	which contains a gratuitous insult implying as it does that negroes	can make no move unless they are manipulated.	9.506623914316007
16772. color was delayed until 1935 the wide screen until the early fifties.	9.172382857837812
16773. movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction	of the primitive movies of the nineties.	7.082176716507937
16774. each film consisted of fifty	feet which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen.	11.298830036066775
16775. as long as audiences came to see the movement there seemed little reason	to adventure further.	9.680706988529778
16776. motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores	in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can	still be found in such urban areas as times square.	9.211797606752631
16777. brief snips of	actual events were shown: parades dances street scenes.	4.896738704111803
16778. the sensational	and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at	the audience or a great wave threatens to break over the seats.	7.370012644320394
16779. an	early edison production was the execution of mary queen of scots.	6.617351125430996
16780. the unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung	his axe; the head dropped off; end of film.	5.3047058675164855
16781. an early film by	a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss	performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.	6.223798537311233
16782. in the field	of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective	as audience boredom and the first decade of the new device was not over	before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded	one-minute shows.	10.077787124306433
16783. in response the industry allowed the discovery	of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies	the essential form they have had to this day.	9.412742387269244
16784. despite the sheer	beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries art films and travelogues	despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development	as cinerama the movies are at heart a form of fiction like the	play the novel or the short story.	8.879177858597853
16785. moreover the most artistically	successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative	form from the fiction feature.	6.635664781588045
16786. thus such great american documentaries	as the river and the plow that broke the plains	were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.	8.967724891233186
16787. the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early	years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men a french	magician georges melies and an american employee of edison edwin	s porter.	8.05515778733864
16788. of the two porter is justly the better known for	he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the	first step toward fashioning a language of film toward making the motion	picture the intricate efficient time machine that it has remained	since even in the most inept hands.	9.265453482563046
16789. melies however out of his professional instincts as a magician	discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain	part of the vocabulary of film.	7.094413982070551
16790. one of these is the dissolve	which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.	11.70078535703348
16791. as the first scene begins to fade the succeeding scene begins	to appear.	9.108153431441853
16792. for a moment or two both scenes are present simultaneously	one growing weaker one growing stronger.	11.611095582791217
16793. in a series of fairy tales	and fantasies melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped	to tell a straightforward story with beginning middle and end complications	resolutions climaxes and conclusions.	7.1001845830932035
16794. immediately the	film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content	based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.	8.625351458040067
16795. physically a movie is possible because a series of images is projected	one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one	that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing.	7.126083605947334
16796. linking	the smoothly changing images together the eye itself endows them	with the illusion of movement.	8.269544008486726
16797. the projection time of painting	and sculpture is highly subjective varying from person to person and	even varying for a given person on different occasions.	6.898925482436423
16798. so is the time	of the novel.	15.912972383400573
16799. the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall	both have a fixed time but the time is fixed by the director and the	players the conductor and the instrumentalists subject therefore	to much variation as record collectors well know.	6.98928260195787
16800. the time of the motion	picture is fixed absolutely.	18.35227466447299
16801. the film consists of a series of still	transparent photographs or frames 35-mm-wide.	9.141372119147228
16802. each frame	comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected	on the screen at the rate for silent movies of 16 frames per second	and for sound films 24 frames per second.	8.759670146689464
16803. this is the rate of projection;	it is also the rate of photographing.	11.456312700490551
16804. time is built into	the motion picture which cannot exist without time.	10.606407283656537
16805. now time is also	the concern of the fictional narrative which is at its simplest	the story of an action with usually a beginning a middle and an end-	elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence.	6.515281935363354
16806. the moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the	audience is to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same	subject but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic	element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which	would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo.	8.699161445771441
16807. in narrative	time is essential as it is in film.	13.267832376094887
16808. almost everything about the	movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created	and maintained between narrative time and film time.	8.391334806909933
16809. this discovery	of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling	magician's tricks produced on film.	6.0022718218465245
16810. it was porter however	who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the	half century of film history that has since ensued.	10.835970524878654
16811. the movie was the	great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and	art were all but incalculable.	7.975530672067079
16812. overnight for one thing porter's	film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten.	8.864329047817108
16813. the	great train robbery is a one-reel film.	7.993929318399889
16814. one reel- from eight to	twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of robbery	1903 until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of	a nation in 1915.	6.578983157256866
16815. the reel itself became and still is the standard	of measure for the movies.	7.937812674733035
16816. the material of the porter film	is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the	years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old west-	pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's.	9.234578919893538
16817. a	band of robbers enters a railroad station overpowers and ties up the	telegraph operator holds up the train and escapes.	5.9248124760577525
16818. a posse is formed	and pursues the robbers who having made their escape are whooping	it up with some wild wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out.	7.526819372141849
16819. the robbers	run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and are shot	dead by the posse.	5.586682101491203
16820. as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the	band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.	9.530410714670817
16821. all this is simple enough but in telling the story porter did	two important things that had not been done before.	9.696897914193135
16822. each scene is shot	straight through as had been the universal custom from a camera fixed	in a single position but in the outdoor scenes especially in the	capture and destruction of the outlaws porter's camera position	breaks necessarily with the camera position standard until then which	had been roughly that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at	a play.	7.638750478560331
16823. the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the	plane of the film in the camera or on the screen.	10.624097709511707
16824. if the change at	first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the italian painters	about two hundred years to make an analogous change and the italian	painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of	geniuses any art has seen.	9.035114988676002
16825. in that apparently simple shift porter	opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of	art as well as a mechanical recording device.	9.750835564291835
16826. he did more than	that.	23.32925956575531
16827. he revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic	technique in the art of the film.	11.101745213392082
16828. cutting of course takes place automatically	in the creation of a film.	11.534044392543032
16829. the meaning of the word is quite	physical to begin with.	12.66219535679319
16830. the physical film is cut with a knife at the	end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically	by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.	12.266537828769524
16831. if	as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of your child	taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event.	5.478635162975065
16832. if in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends	you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's	grandmother watching this event you have begun to be an artist in	film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.	7.340373926232604
16833. this is what porter did.	18.07116089635575
16834. as the robbers leave the looted	train the film suddenly cuts back to the station where the telegrapher's	little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only	to find him bound on the floor.	7.134266122194636
16835. she dashes around in alarm.	10.324754201148686
16836. the two	events are taking place at the same time.	15.286757158305646
16837. time and space have both become	cinematic.	11.149319374854999
16838. we leap from event to event- including the formation	of the posse- even though the events in reality are taking	place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but	at a considerable distance.	6.986628088257087
16839. the chase as a standard film	device probably dates from the great train robbery and there	is a reason for the continued popularity of the device.	7.966041474159213
16840. the chase in	itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands	cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage	of the journey of both.	6.316426810080484
16841. the simple naked idea of one man chasing another	is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other	form of fiction.	7.9841907921628765
16842. the cowboy films the cops and robbers films and	the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not	only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;	these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively	or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.	5.912034484350121
16843. there	still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full	potential of the new form and to make it an art.	9.109426107774478
16844. the man was dw	griffith.	23.723588594397874
16845. when he came to the movies- more or less by accident-	they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking	for an idle few minutes.	5.938373327463872
16846. in about seven years griffith either	invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource	at the disposal of the film maker.	10.016374535471893
16847. before he was forty griffith	had created the art of the film.	11.679290526840518
16848. not that there had not been	attempts mostly european to do exactly that.	13.085296924553344
16849. but in general the european	efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly	emerging language of the film itself.	9.975081097102962
16850. staggeringly condensed versions	of famous novels and famous plays were presented.	7.433680387260517
16851. great actors	and actresses- the most notable being sarah bernhardt- were hired	to repeat their stage performances before the camera.	4.27094439824276
16852. in all of this	extensive and expensive effort the camera was downgraded to the status	of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor	or by the author.	9.760313258073294
16853. the phonograph today for all its high fidelity	and stereophonic sound is precisely what the early art purveyors in	the movies wished to make of the camera.	6.843761663958459
16854. not surprisingly this approach	did not work.	12.613257243425195
16855. the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques	in the early years of the century and some interesting records	of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names.	7.560137009282395
16856. but no art	at all was born of the art effort in the early movies.	16.48739030261624
16857. in general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis;	congregational membership however is another thing.	8.7301738497871
16858. a congregation	survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;	that is when it can preserve economic integration.	8.477236657633123
16859. religious	faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in	a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group requires	some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining;	the presence of other members of similar social and economic	level is the sufficient condition.	6.45971140479891
16860. the breakdown of social	homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account	for the decline of central city churches.	10.17631246827565
16861. central cities reveal	two adverse features for the major denominations: central cities	tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; central	cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition.	5.166387066066514
16862. the central	city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which	violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations:	they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people	with lower-class residents.	6.258989020262694
16863. central city areas have become progressively	poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus	of middle-class people from most central cities.	6.072134720579444
16864. with few exceptions	the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central	city.	11.079903346665294
16865. the key to protestant development therefore is economic	integration of the nucleus of the congregation.	10.229692579967189
16866. members of higher	and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant	figures on social class give the impression of spread over all	social classes; but this is deceptive for the core of membership	is	concentrated in a single social and economic stratum.	9.114466806251016
16867. the congregation	perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the	neighborhood; moreover residential mobility is so high in metropolitan	areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum	in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members	from the church without collapsing but they need adequate recruits	for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration.	5.244456066630371
16868. the	congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is	secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship.	7.133602476891582
16869. if it were primarily	a believing fellowship it would recruit believers from all social	and economic ranks something which most congregations of the new protestantism	have not been able to do.	8.263162878485103
16870. they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.	14.397979671396053
16871. the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences	has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of protestant	religious life; in fact a contrast is often drawn in this regard	with the impersonal roman catholic parish.	6.394236673549114
16872. we have seen that	the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently the	vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress	on personal community in protestant congregations; actually there	is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations	as we shall see in another connection.	8.24063190314993
16873. the vulnerability of	protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of	the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is	a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore	to the principle of economic integration.	6.461991332427185
16874. this fact is evident	in the recruitment of new members.	11.262177190497276
16875. the	rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the	missionary outreach of the major denominations.	10.415129390448826
16876. there is much talk	in theological circles about the church as mission and the church's	mission; theologians have been stressing the fact that	the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in	the world for the healing of the world.	10.570470942377401
16877. a crucial question therefore	is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism.	6.890421570176071
16878. if economic integration really shapes congregational life then	evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.	11.668791315172031
16879. the task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration	as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar	social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.	6.481905373250907
16880. fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power	in a	mobile society congregational health depends on a constant process of	recruitment; this recruitment however must follow the pattern of	economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore	the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation	rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.	6.543064934912248
16881. evangelism and congregational outreach have not been	carefully studied in the churches; one study in pittsburgh however	has illuminated the situation.	5.107406655940293
16882. in a sample of new members of pittsburgh	churches almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts	with friendly members.	13.523554530101727
16883. if we add to these contacts with friendly	members the contacts with an organization of the church	then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment	is through friendly contact.	9.356366444836443
16884. on the surface this seems a sound	approach to christian mission: members of the congregation show by	their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people	respond in kind by joining the church.	8.230257738568163
16885. missionary outreach	by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what	is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority	of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic	position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle	of informal relations.	5.244513169635336
16886. this means that the antennae of the congregation	are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths	of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;	the mission of the church is actually a process of informal	co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people	who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.	9.200600728474756
16887. churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long	as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people	who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits	diminishes the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no	longer keep it going.	5.258317824546828
16888. the transmutation of mission to co-optation	is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities	worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members.	8.420146734401584
16889. the	proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts	by the clergy and friendly contacts	by members.	6.115727869567055
16890. 1 per cent of the initial contacts with	new members.	20.280581135742757
16891. in general friendly contact with a member followed by	contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment	by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic	integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission	in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are	the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from	the neighborhood.	5.339023860861084
16892. the inner life of congregations will prosper so long	as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize	together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability	of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as	the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the	membership.	8.061668816165932
16893. economic integration ceases when the social and economic	statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of	the congregation.	7.052482798344512
16894. in a rapidly changing society congregations will run	into difficulties repeatedly since such nice balances of economic integration	are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single	generation.	10.80016677012453
16895. the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations	have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred	years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle	to maintain economic balance.	8.632956291361083
16896. the expense of this type of organization	in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which	deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental	questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile	society; nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregations	illumines the nature of the protestant development.	10.663556200694169
16897. it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had	split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal	basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings.	6.374542347482021
16898. these trends	seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.	8.147511534518843
16899. residential	associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.	7.219864401396966
16900. the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential	communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb	negro and white blue collar and white collar can be viewed as	symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.	6.95878961065685
16901. it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved	with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to crystallize	the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.	5.66420875768004
16902. the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the	drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations.	10.197809726835413
16903. this	conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable	environment.	6.474289344363617
16904. more than creatures of metropolitan forces the	churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan	life crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of	peoples giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world	of heterogeneous peoples.	8.456836341120566
16905. since american life is committed	above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the	countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have	fought a desperate rearguard action against the expanding interdependence	of the metropolis.	5.827520327056596
16906. consumer communities have suffered at the hands	of the productive interests.	9.092040025257681
16907. negroes puerto ricans and rural	newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities.	7.198110130805917
16908. soon they will	fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches	will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized	their history for a century.	7.824034854911129
16909. the identification of the basic unit	of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a	residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply	means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian	fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.	5.491231576792489
16910. mission	to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential	community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan	interdependence with residential exclusion.	11.147822518413468
16911. this interpretation	of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could	lead to various projections for the churches.	6.447203476403272
16912. it could be argued	that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed	to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the	middle classes.	11.415701310465499
16913. it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain	religious activity since worship presupposes some local stabilities.	9.06480886893713
16914. whatever projection one makes the striking fact about congregational	and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the	social identity of middle-class people.	9.312725486948404
16915. attention will be given	in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational	churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the	communal style of the middle classes.	7.21045375980988
16916. the keynotes of this style are	activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem.	9.500645600714444
16917. these	values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictating	the methods of child rearing determining the pattern of community	participation setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of	middle-class illness and informing the congregational life of the major	denominations.	6.002289985742588
16918. fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly	contact form the iron cage of denominational religion.	8.771717653532509
16919. its contents	are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued	by the congregation.	6.5425437827926975
16920. what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention	under the rubric of the organization church.	10.889967337975571
16921. an understanding	of the new role of residential association in an industrial society	serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of	conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.	6.370602220389951
16922. the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes	turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs	and charities should fill the same need.	10.144669922955831
16923. with capital largely squandered there seemed to them no other course	to pursue.	9.071693166734782
16924. the directors sold directly to concessionaires who	had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.	9.87465967554784
16925. these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt	with the indians through engages who might be habitants voyageurs	or even soldiers.	6.073055287865293
16926. the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of	one-tenth on the goods they traded and all pelts were to be taken to	company stores and shipped to france in company ships.	8.42106398818081
16927. the company	disposed of the pelts but with what profit the records do not show.	7.621790739929155
16928. in accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish	presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians.	11.92636976957032
16929. the lavish	use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade	of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change	in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men.	6.923641682398208
16930. traders	from the english colonies were far more generous and indian loyalty	turned to them.	8.356285319346279
16931. protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded	and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian	insurrections that brought ruin to the company.	6.192852566509954
16932. in 1721	the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do	all that was necessary to protect the colony.	11.104308469927664
16933. they ordered the raising	of troops and obtained 75000 livres with which to build forts.	8.529384396436171
16934. they	adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts.	9.333953776432251
16935. in each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading	depot to supply the smaller trading houses.	10.419403229165408
16936. for southeastern	louisiana	mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies	for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by british	traders.	12.080133553994742
16937. mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending	northward to the sources of the tennessee river.	8.908807562819122
16938. fort toulouse	on the alabama river had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas	and choctaws but money was available for only one other new	post near the present nashville tennessee and this was soon abandoned.	8.095440066121041
16939. west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi	district of which new orleans was headquarters.	10.536560617792196
16940. dependent upon it	were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers	of new spain.	9.13096918803735
16941. on the middle mississippi a principal	post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas.	10.776395109396132
16942. it was hoped	that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west	principally down the arkansas river.	11.095850905270071
16943. on the ohio or wabash was to	be built another post at the fork of two great rivers.	8.290301920521935
16944. other	posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication	with canada.	10.69650458270907
16945. on the upper mississippi the illinois post was	to be established near kaskaskia and dependent posts were to be built	on the missouri where there are mines in abundance.	7.629715684665324
16946. each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible	to a director-general at new orleans.	10.877487266205465
16947. an elaborate system of accounting	and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the	most scientific way.	8.379674955664733
16948. concessionaires were to be under the supervision	of the directors.	12.059553300764566
16949. engages must be loyal to the concessionaires	and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.	7.08807315943841
16950. the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose	of their pelts to the concessionaires.	12.53349596367956
16951. only two principal storehouses	were actually established- one at mobile the other at new	orleans.	6.21452252000856
16952. new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi	and west of that river and on the ohio and wabash.	13.170463526079617
16953. mobile	was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district.	7.463039859026617
16954. the power that bienville exercised during his first administration	cannot be determined.	11.526808379373652
16955. regulations for the indian trade were	made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane and bienville	apparently did not have control of that body.	6.947160696363815
16956. the conseil even	treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and	on its own authority sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable	for the peltry trade.	7.50754326356321
16957. it decided also that the purely secular	efforts of bienville were insufficient and sent missionaries to	win the savages from the heathen carolinians.	7.145349492282141
16958. during the first	administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district	was a lucrative source of revenue.	12.60167299548692
16959. the alabamas brought in annually	15000 to 20000 deerskins and the choctaws and chickasaws brought	the total up to 50000 pelts.	6.171667831727814
16960. these deerskins were the raw material	for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the	tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods.	8.86244055445709
16961. during his first administration bienville succeeded in keeping carolina	traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country.	8.982458147944923
16962. the	director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french	goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the indian	needs.	12.450917143678124
16963. the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which	goods could be moved quickly and cheaply.	6.458244710292096
16964. de la laude commander	of the alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able	to make them look upon the british as poor competitors.	8.361915966134125
16965. diron d'artaguette	the most prominent trader in the district was energetic and	resourceful but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors.	5.340061279329135
16966. he became after a time commander of a post on the alabama	river but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district	and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade.	10.109122016008884
16967. the	chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district.	7.58670252185406
16968. their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama	the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland rivers and was	easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees.	8.670182913031606
16969. in 1720 some	chickasaws massacred the french traders among them and did not	make peace for four years.	7.339579665564462
16970. venturesome traders however continued to	come to them from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelts	for the french markets.	9.033602073789076
16971. british traders from south carolina incited	the indians against the french and there developed french and	british factions in the tribe.	6.6849488932830035
16972. the chickasaws finally were the occasion	for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana.	9.06217713992864
16973. to hold them was an essential part of french policy for they	controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile.	8.00536682606819
16974. they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region	from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french	settlements near the gulf.	8.910597607007828
16975. bienville realized that if the french	were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british	goods french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant	as the carolinians and at reasonable prices.	6.639021256706022
16976. his urgings brought	some results.	11.489770875828032
16977. the company of the indies promised to send over a supply	of indian trading goods and to price them more cheaply in terms	of deerskins.	7.541250768314488
16978. but it coupled with this a requirement that indians	must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation	into and out of the indian country.	13.13087798289248
16979. the insistence of bienville	upon giving liberal prices to the indians in order to drive	back the carolina traders was probably a factor that led to his recall	in 1724.	8.5630694919675
16980. for two years his friend and cousin boisbriant remained	as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance.	9.678151052422356
16981. although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders	and even kill some of them the carolina advance continued.	7.952733830574551
16982. the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina	and when perier came over as governor in 1727 he was given special	instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district.	10.09927577918107
16983. but the	company of the indies holding to its program of economy made no arrangements	to furnish better goods at attractive prices.	7.1670010504180635
16984. to the directors	the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy.	12.39356818219751
16985. perier	attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among	the indians.	6.849099052281829
16986. these agents were to ascertain the difference between	english and french goods and the prices charged the indians.	9.003528037298764
16987. they	were to conciliate the unfriendly savages and wherever possible to	incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina.	6.236722447000353
16988. they were	to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant	supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.	9.86417223571795
16989. perier's intrigues gained some successes.	4.6894459214429505
16990. the savages divided	into two factions; one was british and the other french.	9.130886167017161
16991. so hostile	did these factions become that among the choctaws civil war broke	out.	7.90855485905511
16992. perier's efforts however were on the whole ineffective	in winning back the tribes of the mobile district and he decided	to send troops into the troubled country.	8.39364540639394
16993. he asked the government	for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest	english traders and disloyal indians.	7.898065791130411
16994. in spite of the company's	restrictions he planned to build new posts in the territory.	11.219697413314373
16995. he asked	also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians'	pelts.	8.48284763688391
16996. no help came from the crown and perier in desperation	gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d'artaguette.	13.129823974223713
16997. d'artaguette went vigorously to work and gave credit to many	hunters.	6.043675206156955
16998. but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts and soon	french trade in the region was at an end.	12.131318792510184
16999. perier finally in one	last bid in 1730 cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent	above the cost in france.	7.825025468009356
17000. the indians were not impressed and held	to the carolina traders who swarmed over the country almost to the	mississippi.	11.297045265420532
17001. with the loss of the mobile trade which ended	all profits from louisiana the natchez indians revolted.	9.476940101983118
17002. they destroyed	a trading house and pillaged the goods and harassed french shipping	on the mississippi.	8.920165203708642
17003. the war to subdue them taxed the resources	of the colony and piled up enormous debts.	7.2106239718101195
17004. in january 1731 the company	asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.	12.65419808234072
17005. it stated that it had lost 20000000 livres in its operations and apparently	blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade.	7.398414400906089
17006. it offered	to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity.	11.065744311311246
17007. the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the	company at 1450000 livres.	7.182661684395111
17008. thenceforth the commerce of louisiana	was free to all frenchmen.	9.611504248283081
17009. company rule in louisiana left the	colony without fortifications arms munitions or supplies.	5.706272678778614
17010. the difficulties	of trade had ruined many voyageurs and numbers of them	had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families.	8.947231635619618
17011. others	left the country and there was no one familiar with the indian trade.	11.041370984970838
17012. if this trade should be resumed the habitants who had come	to be farmers or artisans and soldiers discharged from the army must	be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois.	8.704549030874123
17013. this was a	slow and difficult course and french trade suffered from the many mistakes	of the new group of traders.	7.354152626157513
17014. these men were without capital or	experience.	14.332713588205483
17015. perier and salmon the intendant wished either	to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown	furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts	with pelts.	6.2609115210874755
17016. bienville who returned to succeed perier in 1732 objected	that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing	a trade in which they could see no hope of profits.	9.991818021353588
17017. he reported too	that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability	sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king's goods.	6.067439232327231
17018. he did	find some to trust however and he employed the king's soldiers	to trade.	8.480906447501992
17019. with no company to interfere he kept close control over all	the traders.	8.163840467830331
17020. in order to compete with english traders bienville	radically changed the price schedule.	13.822818135242853
17021. the king should expect	no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france	which would cover the expense of transportation and handling was all	he charged the traders.	8.421190280561877
17022. they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned	a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury's expense.	10.368811238115715
17023. they would be particularly displeased with the state department if	it were the source of such reports.	10.810750203665743
17024. few things are more perilous for	the state department than a displeased congressman.	9.27725422069678
17025. the reason	for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends	so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are	so available.	7.096738779149185
17026. first the state department is unique among government	agencies for its lack of public supporters.	12.770883997209538
17027. the farmers may be aroused	if congress cuts into the agriculture department's budget.	6.2537254010419305
17028. businessmen	will rise if congress attacks the commerce department.	9.31781317116676
17029. labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department; the	chamber of commerce assaults upon the treasury.	5.670000032957201
17030. a kaleidoscope of	pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly	toward the department of health education and welfare.	10.429183028220994
17031. the congressman's	patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense	department.	6.301054361496545
17032. tampering with the post office may infuriate every	voter who can write.	9.94150696566468
17033. with all these agencies the congressman	must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.	7.481591719093561
17034. no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon	the state department in anger.	9.693482122279441
17035. in many sections he may even	reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson.	8.83637674005979
17036. after	all the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer the laborer	or the businessman but to foreigners.	9.984731746991564
17037. not only do these foreigners	not vote for american congressmen; they are also probably	ungrateful for uncle's sam's bounty.	5.696134044856086
17038. and are not the state department	men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders	who have never met a payroll?	8.351554700215612
17039.  will not the righteous congressman	be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america	and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes?	6.714800817660384
17040. 	the chances are excellent that he will.	9.1143910147635
17041. the result is	that the state department's perpetual position before congress is	the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever	the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife.	5.65613573214224
17042. people in this	position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the	newspapers.	8.83674839821142
17043. state keeps the junketeering list a secret.	7.9724203181068996
17044. the	department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion.	8.328324929403953
17045. congress is a harsh master.	9.514984400888972
17046. state is expected to arrange the	touring cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected	to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers	are expected to entertain him according to his whim frequently with	their savings for the children's college tuition.	5.96205255425131
17047. but come	the next session of congress state can expect only that its summer	guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money	for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for	its diplomats.	6.835086529464569
17048. the congressman who in paris may have stuffed his	wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will	systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance	for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury.	6.93854261414584
17049. in the matter of money state's most unrelenting watchdog during	the eisenhower years was representative john j rooney of	brooklyn who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses.	6.257344898941402
17050. diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful	coexistence not with nikita khrushchev but with john rooney.	8.208486456437297
17051. in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of	techniques they had tried to bring rooney around- friendly persuasion	groveling abasement pressure subtly exerted through other powerful	congressmen tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic	corps.	5.504929350511257
17052. the trouble explained	loy henderson then deputy undersecretary for administration	is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing	it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we	do.	8.424358564190666
17053. one year the department collected a file of case histories	to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's	entertainment bills out of personal income.	7.247019559076863
17054. news of the	project reached the press.	13.61533033871207
17055. next day reports went through the department	that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt	to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances	and had sworn an oath that that year expense allowances would not	rise a dollar.	5.70455460069808
17056. the department's constant	fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic	bloody engagements with the senate.	8.481326715322469
17057. armed with constitutional	power to negate the executive's foreign policy the senate carries	a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department's	back or on the head of the secretary of state.	8.279226263562801
17058. with	its power to investigate the senate can paralyze the secretary by	keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees as it	did with dean acheson.	8.358625975680528
17059. john foster dulles escaped by keeping his	personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson who was then	operating the senate refused to let it become an inquisition.	7.25348965868289
17060. during	dulles's first two years in office while republicans ran the	senate the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for	its	blood since 1945.	10.87337276092379
17061. an internal police operation managed by scott	mcleod a former fbi man installed as security officer	upon congressional insistence was part of the vengeance.	6.693784248892481
17062. so was	the attack upon charles e bohlen when eisenhower appointed him	ambassador to moscow.	8.951856606406375
17063. the principal mauler however was senator	joseph mccarthy.	8.66898176800455
17064. where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle	for the department dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates.	8.535249524773445
17065. fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats	dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men	had their way.	5.285453820706482
17066. in view of eisenhower's reluctance to concede	that anything was amiss in the terror it is doubtful that heroic intervention	by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him	and the country's foreign policy.	7.0627540781881475
17067. in any event the example of acheson's	trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke	it.	8.062791765352172
17068. he elected to get along.	16.831585996460007
17069. during this dark chapter	in state department history men who had offered foreign-policy ideas	later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol	hill.	6.33897508674635
17070. their old errors of judgment were equated in the curious	logic of the time with present treasonous intent.	10.222083753176337
17071. their successors	absorbing the lesson made it a point to have few ideas.	8.766255832470602
17072. this	in turn brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats	took control.	8.096307747803055
17073. in the new style the department was berated as intellectually	barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit	the russians.	8.698025663082113
17074. for three or four years in the mid-1950's this	complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there	was a dull legislative afternoon.	9.92910826354321
17075. it became smart to say that the fault	was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by	anyone but himself.	9.06146006126354
17076. an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth	of new thought was created by the senate's own penchant for crucifying	anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation.	7.66221647348464
17077. getting along with foreigners	there are ninety-eight foreign	embassies and legations in washington.	5.242340847591437
17078. they range from the soviet	embassy on sixteenth street a gray shuttered pile suggesting a	funeral-accessories	display house to what congressman rooney has called	that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street the modern cement-and-glass	chancery of the belgians.	5.937009335896798
17079. here is the world of the	chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter of caviar on stale crackers	and the warm martini of the poseur the spy the party crasher	and the patriot of the rented tails the double cross and the tired	lothario.	6.374691497333884
17080. into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries	around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions	on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.	8.156102906305232
17081. here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty	the secret of the anti-missile missile or an invitation to dinner.	7.114049323574644
17082. out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting	to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington.	11.449700741381738
17083. some like the british and the french maintain an elaborate	system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special	areas of the american scene.	6.967256039806328
17084. other embassies cable home the	new york times without changing a comma.	8.752679662330214
17085. each has its peculiar	style.	10.119400643700384
17086. the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage	headquarters.	11.80272556939358
17087. when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over	in 1957 from georgi zaroubin he made a determined effort to change	this idea.	6.782099569820316
17088. menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer's	grin and a hearty handclasp.	7.149809343128952
17089. to everyone's astonishment he seemed	no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt	was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov.	4.427788116973589
17090. where his predecessors	had glowered menshikov smiled.	10.926614613272971
17091. where they had affected the	bleak social style of embalmers' assistants menshikov went abroad	gorgeous in white tie and tails.	5.870567835161776
17092. overnight he became the most available	man in washington.	10.508096971407195
17093. speeches by the soviet ambassador became the	vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club	alike.	6.041216371598813
17094. in senator joseph mccarthy's phrase it was the most	unheard-of thing ever heard of.	7.673085854962261
17095. a newspaperman who met him at a reception	swore that he asked menshikov: what should we call you?	6.453062844966339
17096. 	and that menshikov replied: just call me mike.	6.220554404292128
17097. smilin' mike was the sobriquet washington gave him.	5.1980813749980594
17098. his english	was usable and he used it fearlessly.	10.8537102415308
17099. toasting in champagne one	night at the embassy he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and	gaily cried: up your bottom! for a few giddy months that	coincided with one of moscow's smiling moods he was the sensation	of washington.	4.272543805866679
17100. at the state department hard-bitten russian experts	complained that the capitol was out of its wits.	12.915104806838361
17101. newspaper punditry	was inspired to remind everyone that judas too had been able to	smile.	6.4714116782303375
17102. the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians	usually end.	9.536078990251267
17103. finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable	because of domestic politics moscow resumed scowling and smilin'	mike dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional	story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west.	6.399080137419769
17104. the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs' and the most	inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians.	8.318232774370477
17105. when king saud	visited washington the overwhelming question consuming the press	was the size of his family.	8.134875164307047
17106. rumor had it that his children numbered	in the hundreds.	9.874884781821937
17107. the state department was little help on this or	on much else about saudi arabia.	8.93348268075825
17108. a reporter who consulted a middle	east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until	the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a	brochure published by the arabian-american oil company.	6.818691075103266
17109. this	is where i get my information from he confided.	8.676706600567162
17110. but bring it	right back.	16.532272849918638
17111. it's the only copy i've got.	1.5903599884148367
17112. the size of	saud's family was still being debated when the king appeared for his	first meeting with eisenhower.	9.39976310587061
17113. when it ended a dusky sheik in desert	robes flowed into hagerty's office to report on the interview.	6.926377216747779
17114. the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american	friendship to bore in on the central question.	7.763252167816913
17115. how many	children did the king have?	9.844744129594439
17116.    twenty-one replied the sheik.	7.388851118501028
17117. and how many of these were sons?	15.143267806954077
17118.    twenty-five	the sheik replied.	8.575602146989752
17119. do you mean to tell us a reporter	asked that the king has twenty-one children twenty-five of whom	are sons?	6.411648948488937
17120.    the sheik smiled and murmured: that is	precisely correct.	8.908764280322178
17121. the egyptians are noted for elusiveness	of language.	8.819949075314662
17122. when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east	peace after israel's 1956 invasion of egypt he soon found himself	speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo a language as anarchic	as casey stengel's.	7.698353791354961
17123. the reports of president nasser's pledges	which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became	increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats including the israeli	foreign minister mrs golda meir.	5.336476872019302
17124. finally he reported that	nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli	concessions.	12.467633627692887
17125. the deep water is used by many people but it is always clean for the	washing is done outside.	9.614327719417469
17126. i know now why our japanese friends were	surprised when they walked into our bathroom.	11.503018824513521
17127. of course most	toilets are eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are	raised to chair height they are actually outside toilets- inside.	5.1768149412674065
17128. a few newer homes have western flush toilets but even with running	water they are usually eastern style.	9.805058736837479
17129. the next day i visited	international christian college which has developed since the war	under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan	well.	9.117832369967143
17130. they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching	and learning.	13.38435950320005
17131. the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical	stockroom.	8.676426299105334
17132. spiritual life is cultivated but students do not need	to be christian.	9.074245452187524
17133. they have an enviable record of being able to place	in employment 100% of their graduates.	7.452792339091803
17134. in the afternoon miss	hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs	kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers.	11.68796608390481
17135. mrs	hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about- beautiful	artistically talented an artful manager of her big household-	and yet looking like a pampered gentle japanese	woman.	5.581340052155373
17136. she was a real experience! the dances were as beautiful	as anything i have ever seen- they rival the new york rockettes	for scenery and precision as well as imagination.	8.341828711969361
17137. because	don was leaving the next day i spent the evening with him at asia	center.	9.362579403316156
17138. the following morning mr morikawa called for me and	we went to visit schools- kindergarten middle-school elementary	school and high school- mr yoshimoto's school.	5.8631036493271536
17139. there	is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected- some think	too much.	7.025864785883926
17140. there is a great deal of thought being given to	the question of moral education in the schools.	19.28169063320067
17141. with the loss of the	emperor diety in japan the people are left in confusion with no god	or moral teachings that have strength.	9.464631254182423
17142. the older parents continued	to teach their children traditional principles but the younger people	who have lost all faith and convictions are now parents.	8.411645620367185
17143. there seems	to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles	to give stability.	7.610302065806753
17144. as a result money is spent quickly and freely	with no thought of its value.	13.280420485314092
17145. gambling is everywhere especially among	students.	7.991420918275693
17146. the government	has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education	for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction	and are confused.	7.186290160924707
17147. i was told that it is quite likely that japanese	soldiers would not fight again- for why should they?	9.470494180746556
17148.  it will be	painful but interesting to see what kind of a god these people will	create or what strong convictions they will develop.	11.801584523620177
17149. in the evening	the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the	new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good.	7.296438998329734
17150. they suggested several new foods and usually i found them good	except the sweets which i think i could learn to like.	10.111453240501124
17151. six of the	science teachers were present and we had great fun.	8.372406535247924
17152. after	a day at nikko mrs kodama put me on the train for kyoto.	11.230067376114755
17153. my instructions were that mr nishimo would meet me at the hotel	but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm	welcome.	7.14230260111429
17154. my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan	travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen	but it was fun for once to be elegant- i did explain to the students	however that this was not my usual style for their salaries are very	small and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.	8.098501144248129
17155. they	understood and teased me a bit about it.	7.628069548981075
17156. i think i would have	been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto nara	and hiroshima.	14.17047858568701
17157. kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its	cultural center.	6.707716165637382
17158. it along with nara was untouched by the war-	and	is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan.	9.227010368749433
17159. here	i was accompanied by mrs okamoto her son	mr washizu	and mr nishima one of the science	teachers.	7.240109750531517
17160. i arrived at 7:00 am and by 9:00 am i had	finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.	8.996213730526529
17161. we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens.	9.17695325385533
17162. we visited the	okamoto home- where for the first time i saw the famous tea ceremony.	11.322445510927814
17163. at 6:00 pm we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place	where these beautiful dances originated.	6.339906617419967
17164. they were even better than	those of tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.	8.797721775427064
17165. after	a supper of unagi	i returned to my beautiful	room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.	7.381614700049664
17166. we started at 9 am to visit the kyoto university where mr	washizu is attending.	12.812535263115034
17167. i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities	accompanying the medical school.	10.499699118373183
17168. they apologized for the condition	including dirt and flies and i was a little at a loss to know what	to say.	11.711904857916089
17169. there seemed to be no excuse?	22.74970609287986
17170.  i don't have the answer	yet.	5.366560343234258
17171. we had tea at mr washizu's home where i learned	that he too comes from a very wealthy family.	6.942166238893446
17172. his grandfather is	a buddhist priest; and he being the eldest was supposed to be a priest	but he chose to do differently and one of his brothers is to become	the priest.	9.435068259963883
17173. this is a significant fact in japan for only a few	years ago he would have had no choice.	11.985290933043148
17174. in his big home live four families	and thirty people so it needs to be big.	11.946471629748908
17175. also there are housed	here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old-	paintings lacquer brocade etc.	5.828972292832584
17176. he had displayed more of them	than usual so that i could enjoy them.	13.64723159790708
17177. about 100 of the most important	items he had already given to the museum.	9.050942096962023
17178. the house itself is 400	years old with all the craftsmanship of older less-hurried times.	11.746418693705314
17179. osaka and hiroshima	mr nishima went with me on the train	to nara.	7.653816154844585
17180. we passed his house and school on the way.	13.52391098010611
17181. in nara i	stayed at the hotel where the prince and princess had stayed on their	honeymoon.	7.75348833540552
17182. a new red carpet had been laid for their coming but i	walked on it too.	9.930861340933753
17183. here mr yoneda met us after a three-hour train	trip from the town where he teaches.	6.581093088949637
17184. even though we had walked miles	in kyoto that day we started out again to see nara at night.	10.687108027613165
17185. in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles	to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima.	11.23256705861024
17186. again the plan was	for me to go alone but they wouldn't let me.	9.764082782366385
17187. at osaka mr yoneda	had to leave us to get the train to his home but mr nishima	and i had an hour and a half before train time to see osaka at night.	7.694378939295534
17188. it is the second largest city in japan with about four million people.	16.985551266421986
17189. one spot in osaka i shall always remember- the bridge where	we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the	still waters of the river.	6.26452678527238
17190. in the midst of a great busy city people	take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.	12.81197689865341
17191. my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45	am.	7.341872299365285
17192. i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little	after which mr uno would arrive and pilot me around.	11.685416605331044
17193. but there	he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand.	8.767333676874875
17194. i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even	when i told them i didn't want to.	9.864120513550773
17195. they knew that i was still grieving	over the tragic event and they felt that if i could see the	recovery	and the spirit of the people who hold no grudge but who also	regret pearl harbor i would be happier and would understand better	a new japan.	8.679752338433861
17196. there were no words to say this but there was no need.	20.29819666068955
17197. the teachers of mr uno's school gave me a small gift	to thank me for coming.	6.464020502899376
17198. hiroshima is a better city than it was before-	in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace	and understanding.	9.972261157381764
17199. i was grateful for their insight into my need	for this experience.	8.971224946961195
17200. a better world may yet come out of hiroshima.	13.738770105431604
17201. on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took	us immediately to her university the japanese women's university.	6.40159474561883
17202. this day was open house for parents day and the girls were	busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables.	9.133661854551882
17203. everything was in	an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.	5.507260847502076
17204. it was	thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese	students in a class in home planning.	10.688407528156137
17205. our masu is one of the very	few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family	functions and women's needs.	7.262033387217054
17206. i am told the time will soon come when	women will find it necessary to do most of their own work and even now	it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants.	15.226985420422295
17207. many	of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american	homes but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese	artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the	japanese are adopting western utility patterns.	6.855243242658432
17208. at this women's	university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed	that japanese women also should be educated.	10.191184760058597
17209. even today there are	some doubts about the value of education for japanese women but this	university continues to grow and to send its students out into the	community.	8.242585357506902
17210. active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus	where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they	can have their social gatherings and professional meetings.	8.932380724323261
17211. as far	as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the	creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found	by educated women unafraid to break traditions.	8.752669194453553
17212. masu is also	teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo.	7.719351992952417
17213. here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled	in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests.	6.401420825466799
17214. they learn how	to take care of children and sick members of the family.	14.972952827004548
17215. they have model	kitchens a sick room with a model patient in bed and a nursery with	a life-like doll.	7.63390363419346
17216. although the training is only for one month it	is intensive and thorough.	14.385269217892649
17217. graduates of this maid's school are much	in demand and can always find work immediately.	5.3132002777641265
17218. occasionally they return	for additional training.	12.379389757769772
17219. masu's home economics training comes	into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for	the storage of cleaning materials.	4.5774426557318595
17220. masu also uses the training she got	in an american home where she learned to polish furniture clean corners	and work effectively in keeping a shiny house.	7.931308887965677
17221. her education in	the united states not just in a classroom but also in an american	house with an american housekeeper stands her in good stead.	6.867567912707527
17222. of tokyo	after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria the kitchen	of which masu had planned mr washizu and i left to meet representatives	of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo.	10.27103950812573
17223. here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could	not see but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous	in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.	7.920836120797442
17224. the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only	by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following	consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads	of certain national chain stores should of course be applauded.	8.001265768755488
17225. but	for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of	a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts	contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case.	7.618668536126973
17226. the suppositions	in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing	a connection between general company practice and local practice	in the south and by establishing such direct connection between the	practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york	and general company policy.	7.312507364964741
17227. then the boycott would not be secondary	but a primary one.	8.958398798253517
17228. it would be directed against the actual location of	the unjust policy which for love's sake and for the sake of justice	must be removed and indivisible from this to the economic injury	of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy.	10.712242625114557
17229. perhaps	this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire	national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire	economy to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores	in the matter of segregation.	6.386212810153393
17230. such a general boycott might still be a	blunt or indiscriminating instrument and therefore of questionable	justification.	8.905567276595507
17231. action located where the evil is concentrated will prove	most decisive and is most clearly legitimate.	6.701199458895325
17232. moreover prudence alone	would indicate that unless the local customs are already ready to	fall when pushed the results of direct economic action everywhere upon	national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage	to local and state stores which conform to these customs leading to	greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company or even	to its going out of business in certain sections	of the country	meetings in the pre-civil war south largely went out of business	in that part of the country over the slavery issue never to recover	.	7.892195493489561
17233. in any case anyone who	fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary	applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified	that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years	ago or was skillfully organized by white citizens' councils	in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer	in that state in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a	national tv network on which was presented a drama showing it seemed	a high yellow gal smooching with a white man.	5.6096560044742025
17234. it is true	of course that the end or objective of this action was different.	15.911888682538368
17235. but	since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals	and concerning justice and injustice and since in a situation where	direct action and economic pressure are called for the justice of the	matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not	effectively present there has to be a morality of means applied in	every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures	or other forms of force.	7.101078913280823
17236. the need that we not give unqualified	approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed	against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the	fact that white citizens' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation	mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical	violence.	8.56028079375935
17237. an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically	opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow	humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously	brutal means.	6.345602347455057
17238. the end or aim of the action of course is also	important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community	customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person	from stepping forward to claim his legal rights eg against	negroes who register to vote in fayette county tennessee at the	present moment.	10.290946202504108
17239. here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance	to those being despoiled and to legal remedies.	7.178005516444955
17240. this however	is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and	economic conflict can be war of all	against all no less than if other means are used.	8.769422196114512
17241. it is also sufficient	to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs	to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct	is just ie that if economic pressure has to be resorted	to this be applied directly against those persons directly in the	way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices while	if injury fall upon others it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily	and not by deliberate intent and direct	action against them.	6.395257246260643
17242. it is clear that non-violent resistance is	a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian	morality like any other form of resistance.	11.420359757460838
17243. the language used	itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle	for victory.	8.00077514237913
17244. one of the sit-in	leaders has said: nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom	of hell can stop the march to freedom.	9.848761923021144
17245. everybody in the world today	might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom	is going to march over them.	8.056125665748068
17246. the present writer certainly agrees	with that statement and would also affirm this- in the order of justice.	10.05030456772516
17247. however it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity	interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches	forward.	12.241534078222756
17248. and when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice	and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental	good will.	8.002046399788648
17249. it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained	above and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent	means.	11.420305934099403
17250. r b gregg has written that non-violence and good will of	the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical	jiu-jitsu to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance.	6.664813713532027
17251. he	suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent	resistance of most victims would render him; and again that	the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object	of war- namely to demoralize the opponent to break his will	to destroy his confidence enthusiasm and hope.	4.119602516172046
17252. in another respect	it is dissimilar for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent	only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is	based on sounder values.	6.571464796852049
17253. a trial of strength however is made	quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent	resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder	values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means	men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause.	6.975333131747817
17254. this makes necessary	a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of	resistance whenever this is thought to be justified.	11.231396174683173
17255. the question	then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent	means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes	and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing	him.	7.934319488020573
17256. here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some	causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem	insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.	11.12624927338866
17257. a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into	the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem	the more unlimited aggression.	7.979910355486713
17258. among christian groups the	mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that	the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the	christian use of all forms of pressure.	10.865863406174476
17259. since the will and word of god	are for them concentrated in christlike love it seems clear to them	that non-violent resistance is quite another thing.	6.494535660038481
17260. the primary	objective of non-violence writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist	is not peace or obedience to the divine will but rather certain	desired social changes for personal or class or national advantage.	6.909162538732081
17261. without agreeing with every phrase in this statement we must	certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any	form of resistance and then go on beyond the mennonite position and	affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine	the moral principles limiting resistance.	5.460967807904919
17262. these principles we	have now set forth.	11.114711390692715
17263. economy in the use of power needs not only to	be asserted but clearly specified; and when this is done it will	be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across	the distinction between violent and non-violent means and apply to	both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.	5.9668750238825865
17264. economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a	barely	intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed.	10.949055631636101
17265. that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly	in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.	7.375344275895866
17266. there	must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use	of means of resistance violent or non-violent.	9.318964715078979
17267. the justification	in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays	down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against	whom pressure is primarily directed those upon whom it may be permitted	also to fall and those who may never be directly repressed for the	sake even of achieving some great good.	6.363166413281421
17268. in these terms the economic	withdrawal of the negroes of nashville tennessee from trading	in the center city for example was clearly justified since these	distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be	singled out.	9.091433194961015
17269. we may now take up for consideration a hard case	which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure	or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.	7.020596997817149
17270. there may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken	at all this would have to be applied without discrimination	against a whole people.	14.098069484506592
17271. an excellent article was published recently in	the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist	on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa	amounting to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both	the government and the people of the united states in these conditions.	7.792070687192534
17272. h billions of american dollars not only from capital investors	but also from the pockets of u s taxpayers this author	states are being poured into south africa to support a system	dedicated to the oppression the persecution and the almost diabolical	exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens	not to be white.	8.07687467524705
17273. both the conditions and the complicity are documented	in considerable detail.	7.3872355734781445
17274. this leads to the conclusion that the	fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not	apartheid shall continue.	12.284727819897357
17275. our leadership in a wide economic	boycott of south africa would be not only in accord it seems with	the moral conscience of america not to be denied because we also as	a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our	own country but also in accord with our law us code title	19 section 1307 which forbids the importation of goods made by forced	or convict labor.	6.452238470871211
17276. not only should this provision be enforced but	other economic and political actions might be taken which this author	believes must surely be supported by every american who values the	freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated	by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly	contribute to the enslavement of another nation.	8.841481381250377
17277. northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights	and of integration.	7.0153349163529555
17278. they have also led the nation in the direction	of a welfare state.	17.210676507388754
17279. and both in their objectives of non-discrimination	and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners	who are called bourbons.	6.639185508166503
17280. the name presumably derives from the	french royal house which never learned and never forgot; since bourbon	whiskey though of kentucky origin is at least as much favored	by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south.	8.623807106161074
17281. the	nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little	understood in the north.	6.972073611726729
17282. the race problem has tended to obscure other	less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.	10.510746099026688
17283. it is these other differences between north and south- other	that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare-	which i chiefly discuss herein.	5.470487901624154
17284. i write about northern liberals	from considerable personal experience.	11.486577820308645
17285. a southerner married to	a new englander i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting	town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men	and business executives of egghead tastes.	7.476370098486126
17286. most of them are democrats	and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals.	14.620159880977324
17287. this	is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of	liberalism because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center	are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson who held that	the best government was the least government.	6.456817783549632
17288. yet paradoxically my	liberal	friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints.	12.6854464696563
17289. when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and	democracy i find that they fall into two categories: the simpler	ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without	analysis; and the intelligent cynical ones who scornfully reply that	these things don't count any more in the world of to-day.	6.0405987800145144
17290. i am naive	they say to make use of such words.	17.27607299475651
17291. i take this to mean	that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?	6.511125481159348
17292. - liberal	considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will	assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual	and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield	before it.	8.076720963917976
17293. this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian	bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try	to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court.	7.240445082261167
17294. as for states'	rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends	except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist	now only as anachronisms.	8.199913345606687
17295. the american liberal may in the world	of to-day have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed	in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.	6.221470898884309
17296. why in the first place	call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors	an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over	everybody?	8.250579383610718
17297.  if he attaches little importance to personal liberty	why not make this known to the world?	8.977379853553288
17298.  and if he is so scornful of	the rights of states why not advocate a different sort of constitution	that he could more sincerely support?	11.29575055815093
17299.    i am concerned here	however with the northern liberal's attitude toward the south.	7.6032466961332945
17300. it	appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort	to conceal even in the presence of southern friends.	11.17182040988355
17301. his assumption	seems to be that any such friends being tolerable humans must be more	liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy	with his views.	6.175222386502857
17302. time's editor thomas griffith in his book	the waist-high culture wrote: h most of what was	different about it i found myself unsympathetic to	h.	6.6571910889575525
17303. this for the liberals i know would be an understatement.	10.209303830972011
17304. theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate	hatred that was directed against fascism.	10.123120002354792
17305. i do not think	that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the	north.	9.177059380509624
17306. in business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere	would hardly be found.	11.69005657699915
17307. but in our case- and neither my wife nor	i have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional	outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and	come close to wrecking several more.	5.588039200617148
17308. in fact it has caused us to give	serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy	for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host	is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners	who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards	down.	10.374770122565744
17309. accounts have been published of northern liberals in	the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported	universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority	view.	5.306471896612606
17310. but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected	to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in	social gatherings.	9.156741099531176
17311. from my wife's experience and other sources this	seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles.	5.9473304633277575
17312. the strong feeling	is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among	college graduates throughout the south especially among those who	studied in the north.	8.168212040796975
17313. and social relations arising out of business	ties impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visiting northerners.	6.405385490056507
17314. also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the	prevalent southern attitude on most social problems.	10.015014861313029
17315. there	are of course many souths; but for this discussion the most important	division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who	haven't.	6.840383411346809
17316. my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed	rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war.	10.970208578662975
17317. nobody	knows how many southerners there are in this category.	8.987281588528578
17318. i suspect	that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to	believe.	11.936081816326826
17319. i never heard of a poll being taken on the question.	9.216762223161014
17320. no doubt	such a thing would be considered unpatriotic.	12.25893864153415
17321. prior to 1954 i imagine	that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy.	9.051693038226688
17322. since the supreme court's decision of that year this is	more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following	the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would	have been for the old south.	8.865792009341869
17323. belief in the traditional way of	life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones.	11.407835843998201
17324. probably	a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain	unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and	alabama following along after them.	7.48285224810444
17325. old attitudes are held more tenaciously	in the tidewater than the piedmont; so that a line running	down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater	would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course	important minority enclaves.	6.18152934112763
17326. the long-settled areas of states	like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture	to its richest flowering and there the memory is more precious and	the consciousness of loss the greater.	6.596553343841647
17327. also we should not even to-day	discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering	on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies	than with the north even after independence.	6.519495639113599
17328. the social and psychological	consequences of this continue to affect the area.	12.641276626103474
17329. in certain	respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south.	8.586369731029166
17330. poor where they had once been rich humbled where they had been	arrogant having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the	nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from	the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country.	9.887590034884038
17331. and	no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia which	were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly	regretted the revolt against the crown.	6.6876815305555795
17332. among bourbons	the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed	than other factors.	10.53906175590355
17333. all southerners agree that slavery had to	go; but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling	it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did.	5.940986722094325
17334. southern	resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion	and reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and negro	political control in many counties.	7.913082576693612
17335. but apart from racial problems	the old unreconstructed south- to use the moderate words favored by	mr thomas griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what	is different about the civilization of the north.	4.990144929072833
17336. and this in effect	means most of modern america.	14.18290388038784
17337. it is hard to see how the	situation could be otherwise.	17.958973393993553
17338. and therein i feel many northerners	delude themselves about the south.	10.541275883749185
17339. for one thing this is not a subject	often discussed or analyzed.	12.954840406799024
17340. there seems to be almost a conspiracy	of silence veiling it.	15.719960992236384
17341. i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful	thinking: don't talk about the final stages of reconstruction and	they will take care of themselves.	6.823660470597991
17342. or else the north really believes	that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come	around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart sharers	of the american dream like everybody else.	8.427498222685402
17343. if the circumstances	are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be	true.	10.347313469533614
17344. the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western	world.	16.01835911987125
17345. regardless of rights and wrongs a population and an area	appropriate to a pre-world-war-1 great power have been following	conquest	ruled against their will by a neighboring people and have had	imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike.	5.803494799408245
17346. and the	great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent.	9.898610378350261
17347. this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic	origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign	domination.	9.767740261605782
17348. the fact is due mainly to international wars both hot	and cold.	15.81551233919987
17349. in every war of the united states since the civil war	the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country.	14.243934325282115
17350. so instead	of being tests of the south's loyalty the spanish war the	two world wars and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances	and cement reunion.	7.451414216773453
17351. and there is no section of the nation more	ardent than the south in the cold war against communism.	15.839898386143611
17352. had the	situation been reversed had for instance england been the enemy in	1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england there is	little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put	on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain.	8.344822407805545
17353. it	is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners	should have been as docile as they have.	6.59233436176499
17354. the north should thank its	stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not	draw false inferences therefrom.	10.52585957915197
17355. the two main charges levelled	against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social	reactionaries.	7.907511924266947
17356. there is much truth in both these charges and not	many bourbons deny them.	15.792662252254575
17357. whatever their faults they are not hypocrites.	8.805289651211407
17358. most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best	race in the world and that it should remain pure.	16.84788920781126
17359. many northeners	believe this too but few of them will say so publicly.	8.988017965931823
17360. the bourbon	economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of northern	conservatives.	11.600964169131608
17361. but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed	go much further than this.	8.571833126903753
17362. they believe that if the south	had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that	of modern america.	11.2354463662472
17363. as it is they consider that the north is now	reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism that in spite of its high	standard of living the american way has been proved inferior	to the english and scandinavian ways although they disapprove of the	socialistic features of the latter.	7.956419325418203
17364. the south's antipathy	to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners harsh	accents lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy	and the use of leisure.	8.479609192881867
17365. their own easier slower tempo is especially	dear to southerners; and i have heard many say that they are content	to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because	they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.	6.40957873347015
17366. in the past the duties of the state as sir henry maine noted	long ago were only two in number: internal order and external security.	11.84064644877362
17367. by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men	the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order	within its territorial borders.	5.380374612004389
17368. outside those limits it asserted as	against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against	the inferior peoples of the non-western world a position of	dominance.	7.7182539558381835
17369. it became the sole subject of international law		a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western	nations could do in the world arena.	10.06474062438069
17370. reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and	nineteenth centuries.	13.732686090727256
17371. speaking generally it furthered- and still	tends to further- the interests of the western powers.	5.790672519424172
17372. the enormous	changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so	much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in	need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions	beyond the two basic tasks mentioned	above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state	responsibility either internally or externally.	9.80581525599418
17373. this was particularly	true in the world arena which was an anarchical battleground characterized	by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.	8.167928343024663
17374. that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have	astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.	8.565044794915128
17375. his duty was to his sovereign	and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial	boundaries was not to be contemplated.	7.612779858003524
17376. thus to cite but one	example the pax britannica of the nineteenth century whether with	the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling	world finance was strictly national in motivation however much other	nations may have incidentally benefited.	9.748166361568646
17377. at the same time all suggestions that some sort of societal	responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial	state was strongly resisted.	10.975258838386827
17378. social darwinism was able to stave	off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.	10.553576541784679
17379. however in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple	reasons an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has	occurred in both facets of national activity.	6.757142478009724
17380. a concept of responsibility	is in process of articulation and establishment.	11.161511738438554
17381. already firmly	implanted internally it is a growing factor in external matters.	7.909248246210476
17382. a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned	an important corner.	18.014412424902492
17383. in what has aptly been called a constitutional	revolution the basic nature of government was transformed from	one essentially negative in nature to	one with affirmative duties to perform.	6.861124473766293
17384. the positive state came	into existence.	15.999676580661111
17385. for lawyers reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences	there has been a special fascination since then in the role	played by the supreme court in that transformation- the manner in	which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine	president roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious court-packing	plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that was	finally placed upon social legislation.	4.897675288479295
17386. of greater importance however	is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous	consequences for the american people.	10.468785308424318
17387. labor relations have been	transformed income security has become a standardized feature of political	platforms and all the many facets of the american version of	the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom.	7.193277117763743
17388. a national	consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts	are desirable as well as necessary.	9.72355875674705
17389. ratified in the republican party	victory in 1952 the positive state is now evidenced by political	campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social	legislation there should be.	6.5560525394174185
17390. the general acceptance of the idea	of governmental responsibility for the economic	well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant	watersheds in american constitutional history.	10.4054536767867
17391. the other of	course was the civil war the conflict which a century ago insured	national unity over fragmentation.	8.48589089572259
17392. a third one of at least equal and	perhaps even greater importance is now being traversed: american	immersion and involvement in world affairs.	8.55175059073224
17393. internal national	responsibility now a truism need not be documented.	7.304601479639544
17394. nevertheless	it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for as	will be shown below it cuts across both facets of the new concept.	7.563201693565077
17395. thirty	years ago while the nation was wallowing in economic depression	the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow	natural forces to operate and cure the distress.	6.591350627319598
17396. that guiding	principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the	new deal; less than a score of years later congress enacted the	employment act of 1946 by which the national government assumed the	responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.	8.21798865237001
17397. hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through	planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution.	5.103227414692207
17398. in	1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration	came when the principle of national responsibility for local	economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility	proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief	by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted	with manpower surplus.	7.808616934747056
17399. the american people have indeed come	a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.	8.865639764815059
17400. internal	national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the	industrial revolution.	10.449368576471738
17401. reduced to its simplest terms it is an assumption	of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals	to cope with the rigors of the era.	7.844969349981576
17402. national responsibility for	individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or	even to the western nations.	12.942018755729665
17403. a measure of its widespread acceptance	may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists	in 1959.	9.133608295273893
17404. meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international	commission of jurists a body of lawyers from the free world	the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law	to include affirmative governmental duties.	8.447142764283589
17405. it is noteworthy that	the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed	former colonial nations.	11.797660941471651
17406. the rule of law historically a principle	according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal	was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of	government to promote individual welfare.	9.067546233484318
17407. recognizing that the rule	of law is a dynamic concept h which should be employed not only	to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free	society the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility	to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions	under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized.	6.301562905618165
17408. the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common	feature of the nations of the non-soviet world.	16.172707287160858
17409. for better or for worse	we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which	is collective responsibility for individual well-being.	8.334878787708528
17410. whether	a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility	operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more	difficult to establish.	6.667636918766841
17411. the hypothesis ventured here is that it does	and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.	8.235519133209372
17412. the content	is not the same however: rather than individual security it	is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group-	those in the free world- that is basic.	5.9068658629556205
17413. external national	responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of	the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability	of other friendly nations.	5.975336630329322
17414. if internal responsibility suggests acceptance	of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility	implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.	9.23186082280197
17415. reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty-	may help to reveal the contours of the new principle.	5.035197285067069
17416. in its beginnings	the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally	against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence	of such other claimants for loyalty as the church.	7.4710634123432555
17417. the breakup of	the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more	than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism.	7.917099265261576
17418. of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence	of the united states as an independent entity it is perhaps natural	for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest	the concept of	nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies	the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.	9.338320067723945
17419. but	it is more than that.	15.923313057921272
17420. for it includes the emotional ties that bind	men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large	group of people together as a unit.	9.619587462559954
17421. today as new nations rise from	the former colonial empires nationalism is one of the hurricane forces	loose in the world.	8.88369016640216
17422. almost febrile in intensity the principle has	become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that	nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm.	7.270280030600757
17423. historically however	the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the	western civilizational group.	9.049503104972167
17424. by subduing disparate lesser groups	the nation has to some degree at least broadened the capacity for individual	liberty.	10.469047715929653
17425. within their confines moreover technological and	industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing	the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.	5.822270462178442
17426. while the	pattern is uneven some having gained more than others nationalism	has in fact served the western peoples well.	9.143942145765152
17427. helped the peoples of the remainder of the world and whether	today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial	it is one of the ironic quirks	of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the	territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that	the nation-state attained its highest number.	6.496586100414816
17428. but	it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is	no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the	planet.	11.613542856003725
17429. in other words nationalism worked well enough when it had	limited application both as to geography and as to population; it	becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.	6.5998822281658525
17430. complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal	principle of sovereignty.	10.083211972947149
17431. the former receives its legitimacy from the	latter.	8.652756066608793
17432. operating side by side together they helped shore up the nation-state.	11.13075532601728
17433. while sovereignty has roots in antiquity in its present	usage it is essentially modern.	6.807967730793366
17434. jean bodin writing in the sixteenth	century may have been the seminal thinker but it was the vastly influential	john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now	understood.	11.174068618282035
17435. austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty	still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking.	3.9031527879765453
17436. to	him law is the command of the sovereign who	personifies the power of the nation while sovereignty is the power to	make law- ie to prevail over internal groups and to be free	from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.	9.2467562574803
17437. these fundamental	ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual	aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate	political power.	5.348477019806357
17438. the nation-state then exemplifies the principle	of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over	domestic affairs and independence from outside control.	6.0096719853139735
17439. in fact however	both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined.	9.174008010771072
17440. high-level	abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.	7.635594905106291
17441. that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic	societies in which popular sovereignty is said to exist	and in federal nations in which the jobs of government are split.	8.67842675083119
17442. nevertheless	nationalism and sovereignty are reputed in the accepted	wisdom to describe the modern world.	9.082646681325308
17443. is there a different reality behind	the facade?	11.861524694588008
17444.  does the surface hide a quite different picture?	14.21965499591797
17445. 	the short answer to those questions is yes.	6.995483753841528
17446. both concepts	are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted	by a concept of national responsibility.	8.653323964484336
17447. as evidence to support	that view consider the following illustrative instances.	8.284717776849657
17448. can thermonuclear war be set off by accident?	12.330995246470064
17449.  what steps have been	taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the	destruction of continents?	7.124944362305295
17450.  are we as safe as we should be from such	a disaster?	15.731870458151558
17451.  is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?	8.8672224303098
17452. 	will the danger increase or decrease?	8.703394419860947
17453.    i have just asked	these questions in the pentagon in the white house in offices of	key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl	for months underwater with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain	polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as sherwood	forest.	7.280487856933462
17454. i asked the same questions inside the launch-control	rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officers who wear	sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war-	accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other	pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.	6.758955588422433
17455. to	the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits submarine compartments	and the antiseptic windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of	tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars the questions seem farfetched.	4.8798036007648005
17456. there is unceasing pressure but its sources are immediate.	18.07428274238046
17457. readiness exercises are almost continuous.	7.770962487485832
17458. each could be the real	thing.	13.442387294195681
17459. in the command centers there are special clocks ready	to tick off the minutes elapsed since e hour.	8.033044388766235
17460. e	stands for execution- the moment a go order would unleash	an american nuclear strike.	9.020263413143498
17461. there is little time for the men in the	command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.	13.999104751278736
17462. they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches flashing	colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business	machines.	9.076248995828825
17463. they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical	details.	9.862570833496704
17464. accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people	who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so	they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.	8.771143738380628
17465. among	the policy makers generals physicists psychologists and others	charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their	hardware the answers to my questions varied partly according to	a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios.	5.926414801661089
17466. as an air force psychiatrist put it: you can't have	dry runs on this one.	6.4272689849402305
17467. the experts are thus forced to hypothesize	sequences of events that have never occurred probably never will-	but possibly might.	6.7859848063175905
17468. only one rule prevailed in my conversations with	these men: the more highly placed they are- that is the more they	know- the more concerned they have become.	6.265215712131379
17469. already accidental	war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration	about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions	of national security.	5.950544688384707
17470. only recently new holes were	discovered in our safety measures and a search is now on for more.	9.24545854912737
17471. work	is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed	on all nuclear weapons.	7.055466789336521
17472. meanwhile the experts speak of	wars triggered by false pre-emption escalation unauthorized	behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report.	8.28575498243055
17473. they inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold	phones.	8.143507311873597
17474. their conversations were almost invariably accompanied	by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward	each other in arclike semicircular motions.	6.766499497440895
17475. one arm represented our bombers	and missiles the other arm theirs.	7.629635819874177
17476. yet implicit in each	movement was the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps	you and me- and the experts.	9.699695907846356
17477. these men are not callous.	12.944235407808204
17478. it is their job to think about the unthinkable.	19.441216559575707
17479. unanimously they believe	that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more	russians and communist chinese too- thought about accidental	war.	4.840369313918666
17480. the first systematic thinking about this pandora's box	within pandora's boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle a	frail meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist.	6.788722026582675
17481. he was and is with the	rand corporation a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the	u s air force.	8.458181110228008
17482. his investigations made him the paul revere	of accidental war and safety procedures were enormously increased.	8.73925624275683
17483. in recent weeks as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal	by the kennedy administration basic united states strategy	has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war	danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.	6.0781050508080545
17484. the	chain starts at bmews	in thule greenland.	9.362794088760605
17485. its radar screens would register soviet	missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states.	6.940539677201616
17486. bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad	in colorado springs	colorado for interpretation; to the sac command and control	post forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base near	omaha nebraska; to the joint war room of the joint chiefs	of staff in the pentagon and to the president.	6.5403614598133055
17487. telephones	teletypes several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television	link all vital points.	6.795036541141227
17488. alternate locations exist for all key command	centers.	9.86445230802299
17489. for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command	posts on kc-135 jet tankers.	4.8885777088682785
17490. multiple circuits routings and	frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.	7.958821617096724
17491. the	same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these	special networks.	6.714054454179157
17492. and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits	until senders and receivers authenticate in advance by special	codes	that the messages actually come from their purported sources.	8.03142869409569
17493. additional	codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.	8.730115085564892
17494. only the president is permitted to authorize the	use of nuclear weapons.	13.07345610299036
17495. but what if somebody decides	to break it?	11.816204557573924
17496.  the president cannot personally remove the safety	devices from every nuclear trigger.	11.240813388626991
17497. he makes the momentous decision.	11.5867222994674
17498. hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers	and to push the buttons.	13.060114095732757
17499. what if one or more of them turn irrational	or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the russians?	10.246544540866408
17500.  what if the president	himself in the language of the military goes ape?	13.748020213625304
17501. 	or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets	without provocation?	6.22253826116565
17502.    nobody can be absolutely certain of	the answers.	12.00106878270675
17503. however the system is designed ingeniously and hopefully	so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.	8.53386934833751
17504. even	the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order.	9.896754076003278
17505. even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the	go code.	9.20123754309232
17506. in an emergency he would receive available intelligence	on the gold-phone circuit.	12.168752044845148
17507. a system of gold- actually	yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of	the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the sac	commander and other key men.	5.796439112647719
17508. all can be connected with the gold circuit	from their homes.	11.28188316472807
17509. all could help the president make his decision.	10.240307221229202
17510. the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble.	11.832219375283817
17511. vital	questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.	7.357122202192485
17512. officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured	me that the president's decision could be made and announced on the	gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from bmews.	7.431968417654018
17513. if communications work his decision would be instantly known	in all command posts that would originate the actual go order.	6.882001135524138
17514. for	these centers too are on the gold circuit.	11.382977052843659
17515. they include the navy's	atlantic command at norfolk virginia which is in contact with	the polaris subs; nato headquarters in europe; air force	forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control	tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and sac which controls	long-range bombers and atlas missiles.	4.750241548500706
17516. let us look in on	one of these nerve centers- sac at omaha- and see what must	still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their h-bombs.	6.819749811813943
17517. the key man almost certainly would	be col william w wisman sac's senior controller.	6.124281822647098
17518. he	or his deputy or one of their seven assistants all full colonels	mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day.	8.074974396954627
17519. it is a quiet	but impressive room- 140 feet long thirty-nine feet wide twenty-one	feet high.	6.407118658902636
17520. movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts	are crammed with intelligence information.	6.422206472364727
17521. and bill wisman forty-three	a farmer's son from beallsville ohio is a quiet but impressive	man.	5.596404258333482
17522. his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown.	10.025115226115789
17523. his movements	and speech are precise clear and quick.	7.347224783627735
17524. no question ruffles him	or causes him to hesitate.	12.09782044801704
17525. wisman who has had the chief controller's	job for four years calls the signals for a team operating	three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights switches and buttons.	5.409447034048073
17526. at least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him.	13.688960652700269
17527. in front of him is a gold phone.	16.678213632188015
17528. in emergencies the sac commander	gen thomas power or his deputies and their staff would occupy	a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman	and his staff.	9.439900065673083
17529. at general power's seat in the balcony there is	also a gold phone.	6.6422031995578354
17530. general power would participate in the decision	making.	13.0751837195477
17531. wisman below would listen in and act.	8.280301608694169
17532. his consoles can give	him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and	with every sac aircraft.	10.072485468376115
17533. he need only pick up one of	the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left right next to the	big red button marked alert.	6.7529248216153634
17534. but wisman too does not	know the go code.	12.439376834624735
17535. he must take it from the red box.	12.839136852398592
17536. in point	of fact this is a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half	feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to	wisman's right.	9.641433585545553
17537. the box is internally wired so the door can never	be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon.	6.346286423985278
17538. now we must become vague for we are approaching	one of the nation's most guarded secrets.	6.835968483987976
17539. the codes in the red box-	there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained	in a sealed x-ray-proof unique device.	4.755296945723234
17540. they are supplied	a batch at a time by a secret source and are continually changed	by wisman or his staff at random intervals.	10.474689492323225
17541. but even the contents	of wisman's box cannot start a war.	7.3704274231699
17542. they are mere fragments	just one portion of preprepared messages.	12.003534712120773
17543. what these fragments are	and how they activate the go order may not be revealed.	8.003562487058133
17544. the pieces must	be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman's staff.	10.850908960090726
17545. in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures	which precede and follow the sending of the go messages again in special	codes each message also contains an internal authenticator	another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting	the real thing.	7.161717673389946
17546. i asked wisman what would happen if he broke	out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one.	12.106463043186329
17547. i'd wind	up full of .	4.112026720967966
17548. 38 bullet holes he said and there was no question that	he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.	11.972771244668186
17549. now let	us imagine a wing of b-52's on alert near their positive control	points the spots on the map many miles from	soviet territory beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific	orders to proceed to their targets.	5.6198562338187905
17550. they too have fragments of	the go code with them.	12.679288469364185
17551. as wisman put it they have separate pieces	of the pie and we have the whole pie.	9.055001024954931
17552. once we send out the whole	pie they can put their pieces into it.	11.615901265869581
17553. unless we send out the whole	pie their pieces mean nothing.	8.54672699373962
17554. why does wisman's ever-changing	code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers?	8.719939041403693
17555. 	the answer is a cryptographic secret.	7.1800023959541095
17556. at any rate three	men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman's	go-to-war message.	8.659096407069638
17557. each must match wisman's pie with the	fragment that he carries with him.	5.486967357605211
17558. all three must compare notes and agree	to go.	11.841116826434556
17559. after that it requires several minutes of concentrated	work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum	of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber each	with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released.	6.008146093532417
17560. unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals	from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.	6.145380578223216
17561. suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended.	7.976290484847091
17562. they	went as rigid as black statuary h six figures lean and tall and	angular went still.	7.423748911285348
17563. their heads were in the air sniffing.	11.122274917991628
17564. they all	swung at the same instant in the same direction.	14.57523352526445
17565. they saw it before	i did even with my binoculars.	9.46127058712104
17566. it was nothing more than a tiny distant	rain squall a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds	to the earth.	12.07050825550284
17567. in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree	no more.	8.670145711273998
17568. a white man would not have seen it.	20.15912888026671
17569. the aborigines fastened	upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.	9.095190997692436
17570. watching they waited	until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant	across the dry burning land.	9.229067106673005
17571. at once the whole band set off at a lope.	11.346768779833239
17572. they were chasing a rain cloud.	14.123998525259085
17573. they went after the squall	as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow.	7.481880598658488
17574. i followed them	in the jeep and now they did not care.	13.78870247635457
17575. the games were over this	was life.	9.828111439440436
17576. occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly	alter the angle of their trot.	10.936807679383763
17577. sometimes i guessed it was because	the rain squall had changed direction.	7.803812840513979
17578. sometimes it was to skirt	a gulley.	16.247569623735757
17579. their gait is impossible to convey in words.	8.149632859017355
17580. it has nothing	of the proud stride of the trained runner about it it is not a lope	it is not done with style or verve.	12.256850640359742
17581. it is the gait of the human who	must run to live: arms dangling legs barely swinging over the ground	head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target	a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully	graceful.	6.691660735496067
17582. it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.	18.24601680694827
17583. they ran for three hours.	13.176466094151584
17584. finally avoiding hummocks and seeking low	ground they intercepted the rain squall.	8.427965274062817
17585. for ten minutes they ran	beneath the squall raising their arms and for the first time shouting	and capering.	9.822974162580172
17586. then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.	13.304265172156498
17587. they were studying the ground.	12.149092968427706
17588. suddenly one of them shouted ran a	few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.	12.732890020349723
17589. he had found	a depression with rain water in it.	9.715274629310667
17590. he bent down a black cranelike figure	and put his mouth to the ground.	11.87058389877798
17591. with a lordly and generous	gesture	the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.	8.011225127780737
17592. the	other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.	9.596257142836272
17593. in an instant	he had sucked it dry.	10.161053043182417
17594. the aborigine lives on the cruelest land	i have ever seen.	11.211054966634636
17595. which does not mean that it is ugly.	15.905411032302586
17596. part of it	is of course.	29.582018406679573
17597. there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which	are hideous.	12.159139981960536
17598. they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so	many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare ridges	fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty	feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.	9.184535246769597
17599. such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality.	8.099948776030688
17600. but much of the land	which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable.	15.740242434504012
17601. it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush has a peaceful quality	the hills roll softly.	8.583397773800778
17602. the malignancy of such a landscape	has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean.	9.845247658850221
17603. he	tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock	a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer.	6.088732845184319
17604. they went well-equipped	with everything except knowledge of the outback country.	10.41036898286131
17605. the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle	slopes and soft gray tree-clumps.	7.166447210600659
17606. nothing appalling or horrible rushed	upon these men.	9.535291561283568
17607. there might have	been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only-	there was not.	7.365876369534262
17608. it might have rained any time; only- it did not.	10.716979524552869
17609. there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise;	only- there was not.	8.893733352694131
17610. they lay with the birds hopping from branch	to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.	10.511546080445564
17611. the white men died.	13.781867510605624
17612. and countless others like them have	died.	15.260495344847014
17613. even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of	men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly	lost direction were tortured by the heat driven mad by the constant	and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally died.	5.516045132252389
17614. the aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard	and pitiless.	11.366665902392544
17615. he knows that the economy of life in the outback	is awful.	15.81065857056709
17616. there is no room for error or waste.	22.533308540270426
17617. any organism that falters	or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.	6.095492662576715
17618. i do not know	if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but	i suspect that it can.	14.702790290213835
17619. perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his	odd air of dignity.	10.46358650933786
17620. seeing an aborigine	today is a difficult thing.	10.550438436711584
17621. many of them have drifted into the	cities and towns and seaports.	11.017204696267825
17622. others are confined to vast reservations	and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish	them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo but on their reservations they	are extremely fugitive shunning camps coming together only for corroborees	at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch-	which is very low indeed.	6.889108149645619
17623. i persuaded an australian friend	who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines	living in the bush.	7.400625456270155
17624. it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation	even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge	of the aborigines and their language.	12.618320295744725
17625. finally however the arrangements	were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover.	7.976322854170404
17626. we	followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a	smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth.	9.589809437608144
17627. the rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big	red boulder swung off the road.	7.26887393228478
17628. at once he started to glance toward	the instrument panel.	14.452904447662112
17629. it took me a moment to realize what was odd	about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it which rocked	gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about.	7.516706935963728
17630. the rancher	was navigating his way across the flatland.	11.290422470495981
17631. do you always	navigate like this?	13.125781461475798
17632.  i asked.	23.93887313146454
17633. once i get out on the flat i do.	12.036342083894123
17634. some chaps that know an	area well can make their way by landmarks h a tree here a wash here	a boulder there.	8.765502101480893
17635. but if you don't know the place like the palm of	your hand you'd better use a compass and the speedometer.	4.913788802006735
17636. two miles	northeast then five miles southwest h that sort of thing.	10.658466859788746
17637. the landscape kept repeating itself.	9.749457460878377
17638. i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was	hopeless.	10.076803549819095
17639. finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines.	9.294818224219672
17640. they	were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man his lubra	and two children.	6.091941267870864
17641. the sun was not yet high and all of them were in	the small area	of shade cast by the boulder.	8.480206185192722
17642. there was also a dog	a dingo dog.	24.289869009875034
17643. its ribs showed it was a yellow nondescript color	it suffered from a variety of sores hair had scabbed off its body in	patches.	6.446311671251821
17644. it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving	watching us carefully.	10.939785763461492
17645. it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished	dog.	12.811246944801725
17646. no one patted the dog.	14.93767183595043
17647. it was not a pet.	24.27109506353421
17648. the buggers love shade the rancher said.	11.214238661244105
17649. i suppose	because it saves them some loss of body water.	9.09133026075949
17650. they'll move around	that rock all day following the shade.	6.031874333923887
17651. during the hottest part of	the day of course the sun comes straight down and there isn't any	shade.	7.763984711267751
17652. we drove close to the boulder stopped the land rover	and walked over toward the family.	11.003402372448667
17653. the man was leaning against	the rock.	12.558448966615968
17654. he gazed away from us as we approached.	14.57957810799479
17655. he was over	six feet tall and very thin.	11.222893206492788
17656. his legs were narrow and very long.	12.291502738823572
17657. every	bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance	of starving.	7.383781442506609
17658. he had long black hair and a wispy beard.	15.50762251327552
17659. the ridges	over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut.	7.160905254792521
17660. there was something	about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds	to realize what.	13.240886828790897
17661. it was not merely that flies were crawling over his	face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into	his eye sockets.	8.629560727491535
17662. a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead into	the socket of the eye walk along the man's lashes and across the wet	surface of the eyeball and the eye did not blink.	7.1820524648199795
17663. the australian	and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered	by insects but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.	5.9998946679780145
17664. i turned to look at the lubra.	19.811241863849705
17665. she remained squatting on her heels	all the time we were there; like the man she was entirely naked.	6.750432144567521
17666. her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family	possessions which were placed in front of her.	10.704141609104106
17667. there were two rubbing	sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like knives a woven-root	container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead	body of some rodent.	6.280193673923755
17668. there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera	a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity	and high accuracy.	10.18266518374191
17669. there was also a boomerang elaborately carved.	18.383284667889093
17670. everything	was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects	seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.	11.692989779061971
17671. the two children both boys wandered around the australian	and me for a few moments and then returned to their work.	8.765289869429091
17672. they squatted	on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only	a few inches from the ground.	8.71288954910909
17673. they had located the runway of a colony	of ants and as the ants came out of the ground the boys picked them	up one at a time and pinched them dead.	8.712266438382699
17674. the tiny bodies dropped onto	a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple.	8.600325356736167
17675. the odor	here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.	7.952927178625637
17676. the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant.	11.92537212364321
17677. it was also	subtly familiar for it was the odor of the human body but multiplied	innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.	12.581035094596134
17678. one's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.	9.107789082862075
17679. but that is a cliche and a dishonest one.	13.929017567974869
17680. the smell is sexual but	so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.	9.793368506217124
17681. their	skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost	the consistency of a second skin.	6.916244068299449
17682. they roll at night in ashes to keep	warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it.	9.163290053804921
17683. in spots	such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized	the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating	of sweat dirt and ashes were a cosmetic.	5.851143322617325
17684. the boys had beautiful	dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies	and blinked their eyes.	9.48223268196623
17685. that smell is something eh mate?	10.156146373633984
17686. 	the australian asked.	10.982563828180641
17687. they swear that every person smells	different and every family smells different from every other.	6.949974036209843
17688. at the	corroborees when they get to dancing and sweating you'll see	them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good	smell.	7.812533119425758
17689. idje here and he nodded at the man is said to have	great odor.	8.28584403906913
17690. the stink is all the same to me but i really think they	can make one another out blindfolded.	11.2837506990522
17691. here idje you	fella like tabac?	10.017083882263275
17692.  he said sharply.	29.640755728682805
17693. idje still stared over our shoulders	at the horizon.	6.624224072742627
17694. the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin	i could understand and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.	9.082549467473664
17695. it was a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth	century was a great period in persian art.	10.899639203587759
17696. the architects the tile	and carpet makers the potters painters calligraphers and metalsmiths	worked through abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich	the city.	7.092262867715147
17697. travelers entering from the desert were confounded by	what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales	and roses cut by canals and terraced promenades studded with	water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening	blue curves of a hundred domes.	5.146229969655206
17698. at the heart of all of this was the square	which one such traveler declared to be as spacious as pleasant	and aromatick a market as any in the universe.	12.059880547342226
17699. in time isfahan	came to be known as half the world isfahan nisf-i-jahan.	9.698094685688702
17700. in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the	size of london started to decline.	12.445585067353152
17701. the afghans invaded; the safavids	fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached.	3.800611140833634
17702. isfahan became more of a legend than a place and now it is	for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of	old persia and sometimes of the east.	8.857452073671755
17703. they think of it as a kind of	spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.	12.093249620526096
17704. those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky	at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.	7.4293030145220085
17705. but even for them it	remains a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb	a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead.	8.398722901936946
17706. everyone	is ready to grant the persians their history but almost no one is	willing to acknowledge their present.	8.796950293151054
17707. it seems that for persia and	especially for this city there are only two times: the glorious past	and the corrupt depressing sterile present.	8.447144252017573
17708. the one apparent connection	between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other	have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments.	9.209741470154345
17709. however just as all the buildings have not fallen and	flowed back to their original mud so the values which wanted them	and saw that they were built have not all disappeared.	6.634919093769417
17710. the values and	talents which made the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature	continue in certain social institutions which rise above the	ordinary life of this city as the great buildings rise above blank walls	and dirty lanes.	8.464105233572923
17711. often too the social institutions are housed	in these pavilions and palaces and bridges for these great structures	are not simply historical monuments; they are the places where	persians live.	5.153314933927306
17712. the promenade for example continues to take	place on the chahar bagh a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees	that now serves as the city's principal street.	5.919321026687418
17713. ?	12.348350321510317
17714. t takes place	as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge	and also in the gardens of the square.	10.916799855337699
17715. on fridays the day when	many persians relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not	it is true stream into chehel sotun- a pavilion and garden built	by shah abbas 2 in the seventeenth century- but they do retire	into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley	which are smaller more humble copies of the former.	5.633750987292773
17716. and of course	religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques and commercial	life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar.	8.007386021663374
17717. those	three other great activities of the persians the bath the teahouse	and the zur khaneh	and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics	do not take place in buildings	to which entrance tickets are sold but some of them occupy splendid	examples of persian domestic architecture: long domed chalk-white	rooms with daises of turquoise tile their end walls cut through	to the orchards and the sky by open arches.	5.217571114572956
17718. but more important	and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often	do not see is that these places and activities are often the settings	in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.	8.560669154578395
17719. water air fruit poetry music the human form- these things	are important to persians and they experience them with an intense	and discriminating awareness.	5.979238899224351
17720. i should like by the way to make	it clear that i am not using the word persians carelessly.	14.716601934867866
17721. i don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations like	a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool.	4.576765757138161
17722. these things	are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to	the most ordinary.	10.442793826807877
17723. the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's	night are as often as not the lutihaw mustachioed toughs	who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons brothels	and teahouses.	6.872704356301092
17724. a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord	who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring	famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor.	10.722308285700432
17725. not long	ago an acquaintance a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw	of the city stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.	5.768914180643583
17726. the air he said was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly	good.	9.944387150009744
17727. i really didn't know what he meant.	6.018467584121457
17728. it was a nice day	granted.	28.849213502362765
17729. but he knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his	lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.	6.580366736716184
17730. the natural world	then plus poetry and some kinds of art receives from the most ordinary	of persians a great deal of attention.	10.465625216785421
17731. the line of an eyebrow	the color of the skin a ghazal from hafiz the purity of spring water	the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of	a pavilion- these things are noticed judged and valued.	5.446023564815179
17732. nowhere	in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so	well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge.	8.753384353405064
17733. there has probably	always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the	city.	10.11111178963979
17734. for one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river	bed; for another it was here that one of the old caravan routes came	in.	11.636141537631495
17735. it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans	and also to make a pleasance for the city that shah abbas 2	in about 1657 built of sun-baked brick tile and stone the present	bridge.	7.2579619948940515
17736. it is a splendid structure.	29.462863976610148
17737. from upstream it looks like a	long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream where the	water level is much lower it is a high elaborately facaded pavilion.	6.037198241617824
17738. the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from	each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile.	9.14082776904254
17739. at either end and	in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed	and capacious as church apses.	6.541322243974221
17740. here in the old days- when they	had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and	his court while priests soldiers and other members of the party lounged	in the smaller alcoves between.	9.18296879723145
17741. below twenty vaults tunnel	through the understructure of the bridge.	7.056856353091986
17742. these are traversed by	another line of vaults and thus rooms arched on all four sides are	formed.	9.119551330942107
17743. down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing	vista like a visual echo of piers and arches while the vaults fronting	upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountains and	river pools.	6.721426434591533
17744. here on the hottest day it is cool beneath the stone	and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the	vaults.	12.077378870296522
17745. on the downstream or pavilion side these vaults	give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself.	8.109776843988772
17746. from the	terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the	water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river.	7.03003692415341
17747. out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a	bridge.	11.491257739632116
17748. on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops	and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge.	11.479687760832054
17749. it	is a great spectacle.	10.674411823172974
17750. the bridge itself rises up from the river light-flared	and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera.	9.527205958490141
17751. crowds	press along the terraces down the steps in and out of the arcades	massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege.	8.828423614717464
17752. all kinds	come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering	over a deal; a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes	who stand with the stillness of the blind their eyes filmed with	rheum and visions; the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient	limousines; students civil servants beggars musicians hawkers	and clowns.	5.248140775178752
17753. families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on	carpets around a samovar.	9.396888614536362
17754. below people line the steps as though on	bleachers to watch the sky and river.	10.78578157105494
17755. above in the tiled prosceniums	of the alcoves boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi while at	the very bottom in the vaults the toughs and blades of the city hoot	and bang their drums drink arak play dice and dance.	5.37312472418197
17756. here	in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important	to them: poetry water the moon a beautiful face.	8.311761355835431
17757. to a stranger	their delight in these things may seem paradoxical for persians chase	the golden calf as much as any people.	7.961881728386381
17758. many of them moreover are	beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to	ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant.	9.787804683595349
17759. nonetheless they take time out- much time- from the game of	grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks.	6.008087778642015
17760. above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere	to hear or quote some poetry.	13.641375388330193
17761. poetry in persian life is far	more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by	antagonisms- all may stand.	4.834155750993789
17762. it contains in fact their whole outlook	on life.	15.312850389579337
17763. and it is expressed at least to their taste in a perfect	form.	11.225703712032415
17764. poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty.	10.856998132262984
17765. in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the	libraries and museums.	7.684463691325834
17766. in persia where practically speaking there	are no museums or libraries or for that matter hardly any books the	twins run free.	9.371136063683652
17767. it is perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine	that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end	will gather to sing marlowe herrick shakespeare and perhaps some	lyrics of their own.	7.0570792722616495
17768. that at any rate is what happens at the khaju	bridge.	13.663274042018568
17769. boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the	top arcade.	7.657542220589768
17770. here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to	the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they	may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian	music is divided.	9.648750560604375
17771. each mode is believed to have a specific attribute-	one inducing pleasure another generosity another love and so	on to include all of the emotions.	6.670391336012079
17772. the singer simply matches the poem	to a mode; for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk	poem: they brought me news that spring is in the plains and	ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; go tell his aged mother	that her son fought with a thousand foes and he was one.	6.483720169543238
17773. or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: know	ye fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth that	here with dust upon his eyes iraj the sweet-tongued singer lies.	5.277812567050674
17774. in this true lover's tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred	h.	11.134933763243827
17775. these songs	are limited to a range of two octaves.	8.878123499899209
17776. yet within this	limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as	that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the painted	or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.	6.885543098815637
17777. die frist ist um und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr the	maestro quoted the flying dutchman as he told of his career	and wanderings explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred	in his life several times.	5.04742245567279
17778. the music director of the pittsburgh	symphony orchestra william steinberg has molded his group	into a prominent musical organization which is his life.	9.388523350633438
17779. when he	added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london	philharmonic orchestra in 1958 he conducted one hundred fifty concerts	within nine months commuting between the two cities.	6.4396385720268485
17780. this	schedule became too strenuous even for the energetic and conscientious	mr steinberg.	8.842133829401162
17781. his london contract was rescinded and now he	explains cheerfully as a bright smile lightens his intense mobile face	i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts!   our	meeting took place in may 1961 during one of the maestro's stop-overs	in new york before he left for europe.	5.503323973598008
17782. as we began to converse	in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel his restlessness and	sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent.	10.174726351902281
17783. seeking	an obscure dark relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise	suffused with afternoon sunshine he asked if the soft background music	could be turned off.	5.314273079414127
17784. unfortunately it was muzak which automatically	is piped into the public rooms and which nolens volens had to	be endured.	8.085526921967856
17785. as he talked about himself time and again stuffing and	dragging on his pipe steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried	feeling grew faint and was dispelled.	7.083010492793366
17786. did he come from a musical	family?	14.281616133198105
17787.  yes: though not professional musicians they were a	music-loving family.	4.679750356252684
17788. in his native cologne where his mother taught	him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the	alphabet.	11.174926475879726
17789. she even devised a system of colors whereby the boy could	easily distinguish the different note values.	7.682776616281986
17790. when he started school	at the age of five-and-a-half he could not understand why the alphabet	begins with the letter a instead of c as in the scale.	9.987538461955904
17791. because	like many other children he intensely disliked practicing czerny	etudes he composed his own studies.	5.815563925403513
17792. when he was eight he began	violin lessons.	17.504692312031914
17793. soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra	and during world war 1 when musicians were scarce he	joined the opera orchestra as well.	8.139463143382017
17794. steinberg claims that these early	years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.	8.52865167613731
17795. by observing the conductor he says with a twinkle in his	eyes i learned how not to conduct.	7.908942926440458
17796. the musician ran away	from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him	from the gymnasium.	9.865655230856586
17797. simultaneously he pursued his musical studies	at the conservatory receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony	as well in the violin and piano.	6.00123757002654
17798. his professional career began when	he was twenty; he became otto klemperer's personal assistant	at the cologne opera and a year later was promoted to the position	of regular conductor.	6.502122531427862
17799. wasn't this an unusually young age to	fill such a responsible post?	4.768831177519602
17800.  yes the maestro assented.	17.57827437171168
17801. had	he always wished to be a conductor?	8.482868907388323
17802.  no originally he had hoped	to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such.	9.349941030702952
17803. however	when he assumed the duties of a conductor he relinquished his career	as a pianist.	6.925388919289555
17804. five years were spent with the cologne opera	after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky teacher	of arnold scho^nberg and erich korngold.	8.548194694015406
17805. in 1927 he succeeded	zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague.	8.789022319825728
17806. during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin	state opera.	12.356336480641248
17807. two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera	where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the	rise of the hitler regime.	8.257349311223685
17808. during these years the youthful conductor	had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany.	13.201919529127496
17809. he had presented the first german performances of puccini's	manon lescaut and de falla's	la vida breve.	5.943723527420069
17810. the frankfurt	years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg's	wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber	and the world premiere of scho^nberg's von heute auf morgen.	6.693801360014425
17811. at the outset of his career steinberg had dedicated himself to the	advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a scho^nberg work	every year.	8.153563340798094
17812. in frankfurt too he directed the museum and opera	house concerts which in addition to the standard repertoire featured	novelties like erdmann's piano concerto and mahler's sixth	symphony.	8.004948508319828
17813. because of the political upheaval in germany in the	1930's	steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish	community.	8.37942993395318
17814. through the frankfurt jewish kulturbund he began	to give sonata recitals in synagogues with cellist emanuel feuermann.	8.192516166347115
17815. as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional	organizations steinberg united them into the frankfurt kulturbund	orchestra which also gave guest performances in other german	cities.	6.478619306491319
17816. in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the berlin kulturbund.	16.205192823734052
17817. in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin	and frankfurt kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts	of bronislaw hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine	orchestra- now known as the israel philharmonic orchestra- with	steinberg as founder-conductor.	6.221581053279856
17818. in 1938 at the insistence	of arturo toscanini steinberg left germany for the united states	by way of switzerland.	11.092949894989959
17819. after he had spent the first three years	in new york as associate conductor at toscanini's invitation of	the nbc orchestra he made numerous guest appearances throughout	the united states and latin america.	6.760815095917539
17820. in 1945 he became conductor	of the buffalo philharmonic.	12.48851459052422
17821. seven years later he was asked to become	director of the pittsburgh symphony.	8.881235116984927
17822. since 1944 he has also conducted	regularly at the san francisco opera where he made his debut	with a memorable performance of verdi's falstaff.	9.171584403548744
17823. in recent	years he has traveled widely in europe conducting in italy france	austria and switzerland.	7.977052000578329
17824. he returned to germany for the first	time in 1953 where he has since conducted in cologne frankfurt	and berlin.	13.164005981745209
17825. where in europe was he going now?	9.422793021613176
17826.    first	of all to italy for a short vacation- forte dei marmi a place	he loves.	6.8624872302742785
17827. since it is not far from viareggio he will visit puccini's	house as he never fails to do to pay his respects to the memory	of the composer of la boheme which he considers one of puccini's	masterpieces.	8.065548750509286
17828. steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about	italy: rome is my second home.	7.366521936723323
17829. i consider it the center of the	world and make it a point to be there once a year.	13.951155852039065
17830. he will conduct	two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia as well as concerts	in munich and cologne.	11.081065236644305
17831. then i return to the united states	for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia he	added.	10.681481031051998
17832. the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to	be of unusual interest.	9.998523210259147
17833. there will be premieres of new works made possible	through ford foundation commissions: carlisle floyd's mystery	with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist.	6.286716591788893
17834. other world premieres	will be gardner read's third symphony and burle marx's	samba concertante.	6.4135697741687805
17835. and next year we will do- also	a ford commission- a piano concerto by elliott carter with jacob	lateiner as soloist.	5.003310868671749
17836. of course i shall conduct mahler and bruckner	works in the coming season as usual.	13.361901088975868
17837. we'll play bruckner's	fifth symphony in the original version and mahler's seventh-	the least accessible known and played of mahler's works.	2.8983039963495694
17838. my pittsburghers	have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner.	9.412565745906226
17839. he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters	on tour especially mahler's first and fourth symphonies and	das lied von der erde and bruckner's sixth- which is rarely	played- and seventh.	4.9430860120905535
17840. bruckner's eighth he refers to as my	travel symphony.	7.287696047708438
17841. he recalled that in california after a critic	had attacked him for still trying to sell bruckner to the americans	the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.	6.469042175988575
17842. now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and	my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us i am probably	the only one- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein-	who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner	and mahler.	6.705396652053197
17843. since he introduces so much modern music	i could not resist asking how he felt about it.	7.836827672404409
17844. there was	always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era	in which it was created.	12.837444436888003
17845. but i usually stick to the old phrase:	'ich habe ein amt aber keine meinung	.	6.813018375241823
17846. i consider it to be my	job to expose the public to what is being written today.	15.9530321455585
17847. with	all his musical activities did he have the time and inclination to	do anything else?	7.067261095297806
17848.  he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection	to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals.	10.194160253265776
17849. he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain	but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able	to see in paris a year ago.	7.660374751802177
17850. and how did he feel about modern	art?	14.864981454857757
17851.  again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he	was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments.	6.417351643050564
17852. as my wife puts	it he said again with a twinkle in his eyes all you know is	your music.	11.316909646265266
17853. but after all you never learned anything else!	what did he do for relaxation?	7.650739280298229
17854.  like his late colleague mitropoulos	he reads mystery stories in particular sir arthur conan doyle.	8.711692254817926
17855. he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature.	8.574331426462466
17856. but his prime interest apart from music he insisted seriously was	his family- his wife daughter and son.	8.647410086076027
17857. at the moment he was excited	about his son's having received the prix de rome in archaeology	and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation	of an etruscan tomb.	6.3658274305388325
17858. both children are musical and my wife is	a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment.	8.811584861238362
17859. is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of the	angry	young men' of england?	8.71029746502026
17860.  was the topic for a round-table discussion	at the bayerische rundfunk in munich.	7.6908485309484576
17861. i was chairman	the only not youthful participant.	10.199689420343983
17862. since attack serves to stimulate	interest in broadcasts i added to my opening statement a sentence in	which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which	is a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classified as uninterested	and bored rather than angry.	8.090674021765718
17863. i was far from convinced of the	truth of my statement but could not think of anything that might evoke	responses more quickly.	8.170102031810261
17864. it is easy for you to talk;	countered a twenty year old law student you travel around the world.	15.18444840881837
17865. we would like to do that too.	17.648424630082285
17866. but you want a job guaranteed	when you return i continued my attack.	13.405023485952361
17867. you must have	some security said a young clerk.	10.916897451001216
17868. when i mentioned that	for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return	fare but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount	the young people looked at me doubtingly.	10.139947136364272
17869. one girl expressed what was	obviously in their minds.	9.376192439060278
17870. would you advise us to act the	same way?	13.779274686019933
17871.  you might have failed.	20.179938074401207
17872. i think it is rather foolhardy to	trust to luck.	20.349345984578967
17873. others mentioned that i might have had to	ask	friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign	country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international	understanding.	6.327560091715973
17874. the debate needed no additional controversy	and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life what	his hopes were and what his fears.	8.996721041713506
17875. though the four boys and	two girls the youngest nineteen years of age the oldest twenty-four	came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal	interests there was surprising agreement among them.	6.481654675486033
17876. what they	wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political	instability in their own country.	7.900552765932399
17877. the ideal home they	agreed would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to	five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and	two children.	6.77903801994301
17878. no one wanted a larger family or no children and none	hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would	be satisfactory.	8.899630886616864
17879. all expressed interest in world affairs	but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.	7.461367300033992
17880. once again as in the days of the founding fathers america	faces a stern test.	17.104475543230482
17881. that test as president kennedy forthrightly	depicted it in his state of the union message will determine whether	a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure.	8.970768806935006
17882. it is well then that in this hour both of national peril	and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who	made the nation.	12.08880330553007
17883. incapable of self-delusion the founding fathers	found the crisis of their time to be equally grave and yet they had	confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free	peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.	6.536051217685531
17884. seven founders- george washington benjamin franklin	john adams thomas jefferson alexander hamilton james	madison and john jay- determined the destinies of the new nation.	6.10791062778223
17885. in certain respects their task was incomparably greater than ours today	for there was nobody before them to show them the way.	7.138267107512035
17886. as madison	commented to jefferson in 1789 we are in a wilderness without	a single footstep to guide us.	10.349566511681935
17887. our successors will have an easier task.	8.99482255609248
17888. they thought of themselves to use jefferson's words	as the argonauts who had lived in the heroic age.	10.605953668609633
17889. accordingly	they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential	sources for posterity.	6.035595133847359
17890. their writings assume more than dramatic or	patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in	which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but rather	as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen	that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved.	7.377267282388968
17891. strong men with strong opinions frank to the point	of being refreshingly indiscreet the founding seven were essentially	congenial minds and their agreements with each other were more consequential	than their differences.	5.52032715225464
17892. even though in most cases the completion	of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off	enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing	a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual	feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation.	8.371091487210727
17893. before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember	that their separate careers were extraordinary.	7.91497958867197
17894. certainly no other	seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in	so concentrated a span of years.	8.49083554604919
17895. eldest of the seven benjamin	franklin a new englander transplanted to philadelphia wrote the	most dazzling success story in our history.	5.944082459564246
17896. the young printer's apprentice	achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields as editor	and publisher scientist inventor philanthropist and statesman.	6.015458184979562
17897. author of the albany plan of union which had it been adopted might	have avoided the revolution he fought the colonists' front-line	battles in london negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and	the peace that ended the war headed the state government of pennsylvania	and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal	convention.	5.703280866079487
17898. on a military mission for his native virginia	the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian	war then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia.	8.571548935091863
17899. commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution	he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory.	7.695628385055157
17900. retiring	to his beloved mount vernon he returned to preside over the federal	convention and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected	president.	10.066319476056648
17901. during his two terms the constitution was tested and	found workable strong national policies were inaugurated and the	traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed.	6.64694756458725
17902. john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology wrote	the constitution of his home state of massachusetts negotiated	with franklin and jay the peace with britain and served as our first	vice president and our second president.	7.931087778438204
17903. his political	opponent and lifetime friend thomas jefferson achieved immortality	through his authorship of the declaration of independence but	equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted	in his native virginia his role as father of our territorial system	and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first	term as president.	5.7544835870389655
17904. during the greater part of jefferson's	career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian james	madison eight years his junior.	9.598465071916575
17905. the active sponsor of jefferson's	measure for religious liberty in virginia madison played the most	influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in	securing its ratification in virginia founded the first political	party in american history and as jefferson's secretary of state	and his successor in the presidency guided the nation through the	troubled years of our second war with britain.	5.6551760442743735
17906. if franklin was	an authentic genius then alexander hamilton with his exceptional	precocity consuming energy and high ambition was a political prodigy.	8.628353584974215
17907. his revolutionary pamphlets published when he was only 19 quickly	brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders.	8.920447260796264
17908. principal author	of the federalist he swung new york over from opposition	to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly.	7.979876319316643
17909. his	collaboration with washington begun when he was the general's aide	during the revolution was resumed when he entered the first cabinet	as secretary of the treasury.	6.710037972892354
17910. his bold fiscal program and his broad	interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions.	9.196389240216355
17911. less dazzling than hamilton less eloquent than jefferson	john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers.	5.955622986717467
17912. he served as president of the continental congress.	18.659976394255708
17913. he played	the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that	ended the revolution and directed america's foreign affairs throughout	the confederation period.	5.698733177088672
17914. as first chief justice his strong	nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall.	10.245065205057509
17915. he ended his public	career as a two-term governor of new york.	7.058085099427024
17916. these seven founders	constituted an intellectual and social elite the most respectable	and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed.	7.949084347530283
17917. their	social status was achieved in some cases by birth as with washington	jefferson and jay; in others by business and professional acumen	as with franklin and adams or in hamilton's case by an influential	marriage.	4.8496750934688775
17918. unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals	in underdeveloped nations of our own day they commanded both prestige	and influence before the revolution started.	8.638173365000448
17919. as different	physically as the tall angular jefferson was from the chubby rotund	adams the seven were striking individualists.	7.0665539849955215
17920. ardent opinionated	even obstinate they were amazingly articulate wrote their own copy	and were masters of phrasemaking.	7.068408586840695
17921. capable of enduring friendships	they were also stout controversialists who could write with	a drop of vitriol on their pens.	6.29465886728826
17922. john adams dismissed john dickinson	who voted against the declaration of independence as a certain	great fortune and piddling genius.	9.773657156517295
17923. washington castigated his	critic general conway as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue	to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity.	5.8025982695856575
17924. and	hamilton who felt it a religious duty to oppose aaron burr's	political ambitions would have been a better actuarial risk had	he shown more literary restraint.	7.822736064269421
17925. the seven founders were	completely dedicated to the public service.	10.539840700028448
17926. madison once remarked:	my life has been so much a public one a comment which fits the	careers of the other six.	7.8271364363576295
17927. franklin retired from editing and publishing	at the age of 42 and for the next forty-two years devoted himself	to public scientific and philanthropic interests.	5.956424757433339
17928. washington never	had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved	best plantation management.	10.159289380907689
17929. he served as commander in chief during	the revolution without compensation.	11.235405179603607
17930. john adams took	to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor jeremiah gridley	to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it.	10.953084270209922
17931. in	taking account of seventeen years of law practice adams concluded	that no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did	and for so little profit.	6.159843338552304
17932. when the revolution broke out he along	with jefferson and jay abandoned his career at the bar with considerable	financial sacrifice.	10.97726257091824
17933. hamilton poorest of the seven	gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington's cabinet.	6.18374702948135
17934. while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of	the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.	9.475687191471124
17935. if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars he wrote	one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury.	11.754198906626055
17936. to	support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell	of public service.	8.803766455553783
17937. talleyrand passed his new york law office one	night on the way to a party.	9.1742314242203
17938. hamilton was bent over his desk drafting	a legal paper by the light of a candle.	11.364131098420755
17939. i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune	of his country but now is working all night in order to support his	family he reflected.	8.911495543148636
17940. all seven combined ardent devotion	to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality.	10.489586957312666
17941. john	adams asserted in the continental congress' declaration of	rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their	charters the british constitution and the common law and jefferson	appealed in the declaration of independence to the tribunal of	the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of	nature and of nature's god.	6.3180755163848215
17942. they fought hard but they were	forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures	from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of	1783.	9.163309749385041
17943. this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified	in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee	peter van schaack.	6.003057330554556
17944. jay had participated in the decision that exiled	his old friend van schaack.	10.64112914116452
17945. yet when at war's end the ex-tory	made the first move to resume correspondence jay wrote him from	paris where he was negotiating the peace settlement:	as	an independent american i considered all who were not for us and you	amongst the rest as against us yet be assured that john jay never	ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack.	5.15808022666322
17946. the latter	in turn assured him that were i arraigned at the bar and you my	judge i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause.	9.894579337839465
17947. all seven recognized that independence was but the first	step toward building a nation.	7.867272875200007
17948. we have now a national character	to establish washington wrote in 1783.	13.706284704501282
17949. think continentally	hamilton counseled the young nation.	8.352415274146335
17950. this new force love of country	super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's	own state was epitomized by washington.	5.502578578385289
17951. his first inaugural	address speaks of my country whose voice i can never hear but with	veneration and love.	6.63969960290171
17952. all sought the fruition of that nationalism	in a federal government with substantial powers.	9.74870715950076
17953. save jefferson	all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal	constitution.	7.712237438178989
17954. they supported it not as a perfect instrument but as	the best obtainable.	11.5113993768533
17955. historians have traditionally regarded the great	debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized	vs limited government with hamilton and the nationalists	supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter	position.	5.580138352808526
17956. the state's rights position was formulated by	jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves but	in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better	hamiltonians than jeffersonians.	6.275164465933833
17957. in purchasing louisiana jefferson	had to adopt hamilton's broad construction of the constitution	and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton's	bank which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception and in	adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff.	5.025926110988898
17958. indeed the old jeffersonians	were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they	were to the jacksonian democrats.	7.695477416062453
17959. when in 1832 the south	carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition	which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve they elicited	no encouragement from that senior statesman.	6.674318110812562
17960. in his political testament	advice to my country penned just before his death madison	expressed the wish that the union of the states be cherished	and perpetuated.	12.108624328024284
17961. let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora	with her box opened; and the disguised one as the serpent creeping	with his deadly wiles into paradise.	6.076011121846338
17962. nostalgic yankee	readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians	that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway over	which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the	dow-jones average than with the cotton crop.	5.8691275446850755
17963. thus we are compelled	to face the urbanization of the south- an urbanization which despite	its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture	has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers.	5.271685130751566
17964. indeed it	seems that only in today's southern fiction does tobacco road	with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint	juleps continue to live- but only as a weary overexploited phantom.	5.956021613669868
17965. those writers known collectively as the southern school	have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize;	according to many critics in fact the south has led the north	in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively.	6.227663505164898
17966. such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren	have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum	renaissance.	9.84164909784509
17967. it is interesting however that despite this	strong upsurge in southern writing almost none of the writers has	forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel	sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the	season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped negro servants	chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of	other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps	of the past century.	5.067034593857789
17968. this is not to say that the south is no longer	agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification.	15.643962454169285
17969. but the south is and has been for the past century engaged	in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough is not reflected	in its literature.	8.627629971051563
17970. in 1900 the south was only 15% urban;	in 1950 it had become 47.	8.760307011700705
17971. in a mere half-century the south	has more than tripled its urban status.	6.9216790031844395
17972. there is a new south emerging	a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with	the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades.	10.185982911982931
17973. as	the new south snowballs toward further urbanization it becomes more	and more homogeneous with the north- a tendency which willard	thorp terms yankeefication as evidenced in such cities as charlotte	birmingham and houston.	4.998399939368814
17974. it is said that even at the present	stage of southern urbanization such a city as atlanta is not distinctly	unlike columbus or trenton.	13.64045497919454
17975. undoubtedly even the old southern	stalwart richmond has felt the new wind: william styron mentions	in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder a civil	war general now renamed in typical california fashion buena	vista terrace.	4.782766666240469
17976. the effects of television and other mass media	are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force.	8.959906656747497
17977. as for progress the backward south can boast of baton rouge	which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred	and sixty-two percent to 126000 the second largest growth of the period	for all cities over 25000.	5.867932722999305
17978. the field then is ripe for	new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century	phenomenon the southern yankeefication: the new urban economy	the city-dweller the pains of transition the labor problems; the	list is obviously endless.	5.9030447366112355
17979. but these sources have not been tapped.	12.700802997273364
17980. truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism exaggerating	the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque but	as unreal as- or even more unreal than- yesterday.	6.030636480189716
17981. william	styron while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance	insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and	yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes.	7.219406156785587
17982. even the great god faulkner the south's one probable contender	for literary immortality has little concerned himself with these matters;	such are simply not within his bounded province.	6.605469416686718
17983. where	are the writers to treat these changes?	7.124521179155247
17984.  has the agrarian tradition	become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded	or unwanted?	8.83300378254957
17985.  perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the	older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated	testings over the decades.	6.654190813022345
17986. lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to	write of a new economy these writers seem to be contenting themselves	with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money.	8.779605222355665
17987. an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region	may be seen in the southern negro's quest for a position in	the white-dominated society a problem that has been reflected in regional	fiction especially since 1865.	6.373572132805603
17988. today the negro must discover his	role in an industrialized south which indicates that the racial	aspect of the southern dilemma hasn't changed radically but rather	has gradually come to be reflected in this new context this new coat	of paint.	7.6885688488534
17989. the negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting	himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one.	6.822198311941945
17990. this	represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem.	7.59815601375946
17991. but there	have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins the picket lines	the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.	4.169325987255039
17992. today's evidence such as the fact that only three southern states	still openly defy integration	would have astounded many of yesterday's southerners into speechlessness.	5.830543058885023
17993. other examples of gradual changes that have	affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the busses;	his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions	better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before	the supreme court decision of 1954.	4.813169057811389
17994. then came this decision which	sped the process of gaining equality	: an abrupt change.	9.43483640918929
17995. since 1954 the negro's desire for social justice has led	to an ironically anarchical rebellion.	5.220075781065322
17996. he has frequently refused to move	from white lunch counters refused to obey local laws which he	considers unjust while in other cases he has appealed to federal	laws.	10.101214939533893
17997. this bold self-assertion after decades of humble subservience	is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern	way of existence.	5.482209660731705
17998. a new order is thrusting itself into being.	11.512631494904435
17999. a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation	uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role	in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white	man.	5.273798573027792
18000. the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern	fiction.	11.68460877107654
18001. it is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing	the negro as a woolly-headed humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs	and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer	this stereotype is doomed	to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell's lester.	5.537533741897637
18002. while	there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through	the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed.	8.57677846476024
18003. writers	openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man;	but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro	type.	6.614841587692012
18004. presenting an individualized negro character it would	seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could	tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above	glaringly rare.	9.487958474720646
18005. just as the negro situation points up the	gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life it also points up	the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature.	6.0990644410991495
18006. the book	concerned with the negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed;	recently only keith wheeler's novel peaceable lane has	openly faced the problem.	5.340865237208588
18007. all but the most rabid of confederate	flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in	actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance	of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid	ante-bellum way of life.	5.752385684967224
18008. many earlier writers mourning the demise	of the old order tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious	old south imagery creating such lasting impressions as margaret	mitchell's	tara plantation.	6.927312210360649
18009. modern writers who are supposed	to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects insist	upon drawing out this legend prolonging its burial when it well deserves	a rest after the overexploitation of the past century.	5.739270215378769
18010. perhaps	these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but	they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old panorama is dead.	7.118084340053719
18011. as john t westbrook says in his article twilight of southern	regionalism: h	the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely	autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever	dead and forever done with.	5.50846683762431
18012. westbrook	further bemoans the southern writers' creation of an unreal image	of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign	readers and visiting yankees: our northerner is suspicious of	all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses.	6.00699610903534
18013. it bewilders and befuddles him.	12.379930678195697
18014. he is too deeply steeped in william	faulkner and robert penn warren.	13.762631861047614
18015. the fumes of progress are in his	nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes but his	heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night	riders.	5.792023130155895
18016. on this trip to the south he wants above all else to sniff	the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at	least one barn burn at midnight.	10.351952874004226
18017. obviously such a northern tourist's	purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with disneyland:	he wants to see a world of make-believe.	4.332220992984864
18018. in the	meantime while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization	that is so disappointing to the curious yankee southern writers	have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's	progress.	8.675817051149165
18019. willard thorp in his new book american writing in	the twentieth century observes quite validly it seems: h	certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched.	5.373088651365784
18020. no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what	herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did	for new york h there are almost no fictional treatments of the	industrialized south.	7.6675296379994915
18021. not a single southern author major or minor	has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material.	6.900342903304487
18022. faulkner for one appears to be safe from the accusing	fingers of all assailants in this regard.	9.748794950563767
18023. faulkner culminates the	southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been or could	ever be done.	6.673788380015481
18024. he has made it his and his it remains irrevocably.	16.99109751484202
18025. he treats it with a mythological universal application.	10.136286950896842
18026. as	his disciples boast even though his emphasis is elsewhere faulkner	does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly	as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes	families.	8.499775608008841
18027. even two decades ago in go down moses faulkner	was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through	its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the	curse of slavery erased from its soil.	6.785870431738237
18028. yet his concern even here is	with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general and he never	deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial	impact.	7.252923924796154
18029. faulkner traces in his vast and overpowering saga	of yoknapatawpha county the gradual changes which seep into the	south building layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually	tend largely to hide the old way.	5.342282169950082
18030. thus faulkner reminds	us and wisely that the new south has gradually evolved out of	the old south and consequently its agrarian roots persist.	8.996728751921397
18031. yet he	presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers	if not himself: the problems with which a new south must grapple	in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.	5.782089781532981
18032. with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of	six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil.	7.732065090345467
18033. the	thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with	even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually	surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.	4.697294244389032
18034. another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual	devices of the theatre.	11.284881791857705
18035. most avant-garde creators true to their	interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement have tended to dress	their dancers in simple lines and solid colors and to	give them a bare cyclorama for a setting.	4.781706713010973
18036. but robert rauschenberg	the neo-dadaist artist has collaborated with several of them.	8.907090347075448
18037. he has	designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white	for mr cunningham's summerspace so that dancers and background	merge into a shimmering unity.	5.54104384973602
18038. for mr taylor's images	and reflections he made some diaphanous tents that alternately	hide and reveal the performer and a girl's cape lined with grass.	7.059240114326101
18039. mr	nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume	and decor.	8.51275791199471
18040. in fact he calls his productions dance-theatre works	of motion shape light and sound.	10.479296096927992
18041. to raise the dancer out of his personal	pedestrian self mr nikolais has experimented with relating	him to a larger environmental orbit.	6.890832233186652
18042. he began with masks to make	the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be.	11.907224325239596
18043. he	went on to use objects- hoops poles capes- which he employed as	extensions of the body of the dancer who moved with them.	6.0978382911320494
18044. the depersonalization	continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play	of lights upon his figure.	9.292125456306096
18045. in each case the object the color even	the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become	part of the theatrical being of the performer.	8.724596581694088
18046. the dancer who never	loosens her hold on a parasol begins to feel that it is part of herself.	13.536903253425773
18047. or clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of	hoops the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial.	8.828082494732307
18048. as the dancer is depersonalized his accouterments are animized	and the combined elements give birth to a new being.	11.087012151532061
18049. from this being	come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single	unit.	7.572066949820545
18050. thus the avant-garde choreographers have extended the	scope of materials available for dance composition.	8.756500261560674
18051. but since they	have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity how are they	to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal?	6.652168678437368
18052.  some	look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply	corresponding methods to their own work.	8.706067407332041
18053. others less consciously	but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment	with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter	and musician.	7.444969530277992
18054. an approach that has appealed to some choreographers	is reminiscent of charles olson's statement of the process	of projective verse: one perception must immediately and directly	lead to a further perception.	6.859658764640425
18055. the creator trusts his intuition to	lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors	the reality of his experience.	6.440943598962118
18056. he disdains external restrictions- conventional	syntax traditional metre.	8.512546429966784
18057. the unit of form is determined	subjectively: the heart by the way of the breath to the line.	10.393496514595709
18058. the test of form is fidelity to the experience a gauge also accepted	by the abstract expressionist painters.	11.146389465023573
18059. an earlier but	still influential school of painting surrealism had suggested the way	of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly	incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations	of the subconscious.	6.033281361304777
18060. the resulting picture might appear a maze of	restless confusions and contradictions but it is more true to life than	a portrait of an artificially contrived order.	9.696375359867558
18061. the contemporary painter	tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but	their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines colors masses	and energies.	6.577978255273106
18062. he is still concerned however with a personal event.	14.952615453334385
18063. he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence	of the vitality of the experience of creation.	9.907453056624068
18064. the work must	be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.	13.594285307861034
18065. some painters have less interest in the experience of the	moment with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities than in looking	beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more serene level	of truth.	6.263001439993488
18066. rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations	they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which symbolize	an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world.	8.80243974045106
18067. but in this approach it is the artist's	ultimate insight rather than his immediate impressions that gives	form to the work.	8.461529262411924
18068. others look to more objective devices of	order.	11.40248914497294
18069. the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes	a mathematical system of rotations that once set in motion	determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.	6.536117128933175
18070. the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of	intervals.	11.15142141961242
18071. he may even alter the pattern	by applying a scheme of random numbers.	8.33580610296039
18072. but he cannot order his	elements by will either rational or inspired.	12.391226118020889
18073. the system works as an	impersonal mechanism.	10.977438849617691
18074. musicians who use the chance method also exclude	subjective control of formal development.	10.60436556293387
18075. again the composer must	select his own materials.	9.121963874616528
18076. but a tossing of coins with perhaps the added	safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching the chinese	book of changes dictates the handling of the chosen materials.	9.195621854865179
18077. avant-garde choreographers seeking new forms of continuity	for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches.	4.987419528754469
18078. some let dances take their form from the experience of creation.	11.599470446652242
18079. according to katherine litz the becoming the process of realization	is the dance.	8.542790794984258
18080. the process stipulates that the choreographer	sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that	he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it.	12.131558585806562
18081. the sequence	may involve a sharp contrast: for example a quiet meditative sway	of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle	distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged	its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred	to become a movement of only the arms or the head.	5.183773627231957
18082. even the least	alteration will change the quality.	13.674370962070986
18083. an exploration of these possible	relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form	to the dance.	7.378126363529745
18084. the approach to the depiction of the experience	of creation may be analytic as it is for miss litz or spontaneous	as it is for merle marsicano.	10.52793997485707
18085. she too is concerned with the	becoming the process of realization but she does not think in	terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns.	7.726706334074453
18086. the design	is determined emotionally: i must reach into myself for the spring	that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event	with which the dance confronts me.	6.995758010300113
18087. looking back miss marsicano	feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock.	7.584119545996523
18088. at one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all	over the stage much as pollock's paintings move violently over	the full extent of the canvas.	9.97297947657527
18089. but her conscious need was to break away	from constricting patterns of form a need to let the experience shape	itself.	8.422311973990936
18090. midi garth also believes in subjective continuity	that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement.	8.525015433280867
18091. it	may be a free front-back swing of the leg leading to a sideways swing	of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off	from the ground.	5.979343260709799
18092. this became a dance called prelude to flight.	13.459382544030912
18093. a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close	to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.	6.383267123208365
18094. alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal	emotion.	9.420883315894473
18095. he seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating	them to the impersonal elements of shape light color and sound.	7.124711859200027
18096. if	his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures	from mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in	the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their	pedestrian identities.	9.770386952437443
18097. it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the	germ of form is discovered.	12.311826299920938
18098. in his recognition of his impersonal self	the dancer moves and this self in the first revealed stroke of	its existence states the theme from which all else must follow.	9.847286721219835
18099. the	theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.	8.595374757465853
18100. it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the following movements	constituting further reactions.	15.012557465103303
18101. it may establish the relation of the	figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the	light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs.	8.540561012065387
18102. unconcerned	with the practical function of his actions the dancer is engrossed	exclusively in their motional content.	8.780087089354652
18103. movements unfold freely	because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive.	5.496765597505155
18104. but the metamorphosis must come first.	15.727884984467964
18105. though he is also concerned	with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity merce	cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim.	6.520922674180951
18106. he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity any line of action	related to the concept of cause and effect.	10.41669205669002
18107. he bases his approach	on the belief that anything can follow anything.	8.943482033575421
18108. an order can be chanced	rather than chosen and this approach produces an experience that	is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered.	8.495850660644015
18109. thus	there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance	but in the shape of their continuity as well.	9.210328721738291
18110. chance he finds enables	him to create a world beyond imagination.	10.250945973219816
18111. he cites with pleasure	the comment of a lady who exclaimed after a concert: why	it's extremely interesting.	5.606940981988427
18112. but i would never have thought of it myself.	19.323908495594146
18113. the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is	unlike any sequence to be seen in life.	10.11576946384035
18114. at one side of the stage a dancer	jumps excitedly; nearby another sits motionless while still another	is twirling an umbrella.	10.605938309357024
18115. a man and a girl happen to meet; they	look straight at the audience not at each other.	8.989525501894393
18116. he lifts her puts	her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing	had happened.	8.877126427881882
18117. if one dancer slaps another the victim may do a pirouette	sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon.	7.059017583813187
18118. events occur	without apparent reason.	10.490675214025023
18119. their consequences are irrelevant- or there	are no consequences at all.	5.385448623336485
18120. the sequence is determined by	chance and mr cunningham makes use of any one of several chance	devices.	13.713995373184478
18121. he may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab	bag.	6.8460939620499826
18122. the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal	organization of the dance but also its spatial design special	slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be	performed.	9.84833541889204
18123. the other variables include the dancer who is to perform	the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.	12.061068114099838
18124. the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the	movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate	total duration of the dance.	10.933837881870314
18125. the approximate is important because	even after the order of the work has been established by the chance	method the result is not inviolable.	10.25105733770216
18126. each performance may be different.	13.366080401842789
18127. if a work is divided into several large segments a last-minute	drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for	any particular performance.	7.981044498042749
18128. and any sequence can not only change its	positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.	11.242178500039305
18129. mr cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he	adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.	6.052368918616607
18130. however there is always	the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible	to execute.	11.457295589490172
18131. then the choreographer must arbitrate.	11.302717686406451
18132. he must	rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other.	10.616270723951597
18133. he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone	one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation	for the leap.	7.26465337246705
18134. the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty	through all their dispute about it than were the founding fathers.	10.923128558741727
18135. the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen	of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defended in the end	by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee.	6.32447077953441
18136. the people everywhere	had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in	understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their	union.	10.338755424614256
18137. repeated efforts- beginning with the missouri compromise	of 1821- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas	to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear	thought and timely action.	4.801607058045166
18138. even so confusion in this period gained	such strength that it led to the	bloodiest war of the nineteenth century.	12.913948018573697
18139. nothing can show more than	this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in	even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.	6.0954296092375175
18140. the present issue in atlantica- whether to transform an	alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens-	resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that	was resolved by civil war.	6.859394339376544
18141. and so i would only touch upon it now	.	11.594692833686734
18142. i think it is	essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts	of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better	how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse	confusion on this subject.	9.617550925647816
18143. the difference came down to this:	the southern states insisted that the united states was in last	analysis what its name implied- a union of states.	8.029891996594078
18144. to their leaders	the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign	states who therefore retained the right to secede from it.	12.638752311446746
18145. this right	of the state its upholders contended was essential to maintain	the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger	of centralizing power in the union government.	7.4733575111938055
18146. the champions of	the union maintained that the constitution had formed fundamentally	the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign	citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right	to secede though the citizens could.	9.74405717852815
18147. writing to speed on august	24 1855 lincoln made the latter point clear.	7.804264934435256
18148. in homely terms whose	timeliness is startling today he thus declared his own right to secede.	10.725443146832017
18149. we began by declaring that all men are created equal.	12.248758522195399
18150. we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes.	16.315716088441235
18151. when the know-nothings get control it will read all	men	are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics.	7.079730749503203
18152. when	it comes to this i shall prefer emigrating to some country where	they make no pretence of loving liberty- to russia for instance where	despotism can be taken pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy.	7.378798344151943
18153. his emphasis   when the southern states exercised	their right to secede they formed what they officially styled the	confederate states of america.	7.0207393824050035
18154. dictionaries as we have	seen still cite this government along with the articles of confederation	of 1781 as an example of a confederacy.	9.333814988819885
18155. the fact is that the	southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as	the federal constitution did.	12.870895757269553
18156. the confederate constitution copied	much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in	substance.	14.711726101138765
18157. it operated on by and for the people individually just as	did the federal constitution.	10.446677816166423
18158. it made substantially the same division	of power between the central and state governments and among the	executive legislative and judicial branches.	10.423349594707533
18159. confederacy and federal union in 1861	many believe- and understandably-	that the great difference between the constitution of	the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the	former recognized the right of each state to secede.	6.418860734516324
18160. but though each	of its members had asserted this right against the union the final	constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11- nearly a month	before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing	a state to secede.	6.9336839716394305
18161. its drafters discussed this vital point but	left it out of their constitution.	7.604387846189787
18162. their president jefferson davis	interpreted their constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced	association but this reremained so doubtful that there were	frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution.	9.599173774234012
18163. the constitution of the southern confederation	differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects:	it openly defiantly recognized slavery- an institution	which the southerners of 1787 even though they continued it found so	impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning	the word in the federal constitution.	6.208581455378977
18164. they recognized that	slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that	to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive	contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in	the declaration of 1776 that all men are created equal that they	are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among	them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness h.	9.486351034008814
18165. the	other important difference between the two constitutions was that the	president of the confederacy held office for six	years and was limited to one term.	7.6828623332426105
18166. these are not however differences	in federal structure.	13.290153666625967
18167. the only important differences from that	standpoint between the two constitutions lies in their preambles.	8.244111308263976
18168. the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people	were acting through their states whereas the preamble of 1787-89	expressed as clearly as language can the opposite concept that they	federal	constitution 1789	in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure	domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general	welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and	our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united	states of america.	8.071815507030243
18169. we	the people of the confederate states each state acting in its	sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal	government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure	the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking	the favor and the guidance of almighty god- do ordain and establish	this constitution for the confederate states of america.	5.97559013328164
18170. one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts	of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth	century was fought.	12.576253099992014
18171. but though the southern states when drafting	a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this	fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede the fact remained	that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept	that it was composed primarily of sovereign states.	7.212148657459443
18172. if the union	conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining	state whenever it saw fit to secede: this would destroy the federal	balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to	the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained	by their union.	10.011458539996994
18173. lincoln saw that the act of secession made the	issue for the union a vital one: whether it was a union of sovereign	citizens that should continue to live or an association of sovereign	states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism.	6.576234246095201
18174. much as he abhorred slavery lincoln was always willing to	concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether	to continue or end it.	9.921959379779121
18175. though his election was interpreted by	many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal	balance in favor of the union lincoln himself proposed no such change	in the rights the constitution gave the states.	7.117976447405882
18176. after the war began	he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action	even in the border states that stayed with the union.	11.582391135413252
18177. he issued	his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left	him no other way to save the union.	9.341944403858847
18178. in his message of december	2 1862 he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which i	would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union: in giving	freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free.	7.364065264657341
18179. what	lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people	were sovereign in the union.	7.292132460566837
18180. he fought to the end to preserve it	as a government of the people by the people for the people.	17.998780542301816
18181. truth on each side won in the civil war	the fact that the americans	who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to	keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis	of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer and the greater.	6.084320173866602
18182. out of this ordeal the citizen emerged in the south as in the north	as america's true sovereign in a new birth of freedom as	lincoln promised.	10.131738496838631
18183. but before this came about 214938 americans had	given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights	of men and of states.	7.559110318115321
18184. on their decisive battlefield lincoln	did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave	men living and dead who fought here.	10.13356566807788
18185. he understood that both	sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so explicitly	in his second inaugural.	7.6774637496595775
18186. to my knowledge lincoln remains	the only head of state and commander-in-chief who while fighting	a fearful war whose issue was in doubt proved man enough to say this	publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human	truth there is some error and in all our error some truth.	8.687331036149512
18187. so great	a man could not but understand too that the thing that moves men to	sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought which their	opponents see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see-	any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves	defend.	6.753222484974251
18188. it is much less difficult now than in lincoln's day	to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives	in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had	delegated to the states and to their union.	10.94599673506186
18189. they differed in the	balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen-	but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental	truth: that individual life liberty and happiness depend	on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty	in all its aspects which this involves.	5.757547664920073
18190. the 140414 americans	who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion	preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers	of anarchy inherent in confederations which throughout history have	proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign	states and to the liberties of their people.	10.049275695973702
18191. but the fact that	70524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing	concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways.	7.7620411241532965
18192. its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing	the southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even	less compatible with the sovereignty of man.	7.701997472845666
18193. the very fact that they	came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their	losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced	lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure.	7.206965066731889
18194. there was	a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another.	12.786223196947768
18195. there was also a	lesson one that has served ever since to keep americans in their conflicts	with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet.	8.836348083657558
18196. yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case	they did not lose the truth they fought for.	11.072646669340068
18197. the lives so many of them	gave to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment	by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued	ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom's other foe.	6.249300069410996
18198. as cells coalesced into organisms they built new unnatural and	internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with	the entropy-increasing properties of the external world.	7.477808379448899
18199. the useful	suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a	third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with	our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique	for building protective artificial environments.	5.364748760907752
18200. one wonders	about its applicability to people.	12.171978332216357
18201. will advances in human sciences help	us build social structures and governments which will enable us to	cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein	and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to	adapt to a sea of molecular interaction?	5.821376302421136
18202.  the answer is of course yes.	21.95702424776239
18203. for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit composed	of people which gives us both some immunity from and a way of dealing	with other people.	8.093999451061073
18204. social invention did not have to await social	theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier	or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes.	10.15735668756609
18205. but it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific	revolution that our independence from the physical environment has	made the most rapid strides.	8.959336910987195
18206. we have ample light when the sun sets;	the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly	through the air although gravity pulls us down; the range of our	voice ignores distance.	6.6463308268065235
18207. at what stage are social sciences then?	9.787836309830627
18208.  is	the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time	of newton?	10.679511377735118
18209.  there is a haunting resemblance between the notion	of cause in copernicus and in freud.	11.063468348545443
18210. and it is certainly no slight	to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.	13.200702342661108
18211. political theoretical understanding although almost at a standstill	during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth	centuries and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased	the possibility for man to coexist with man.	6.222830298134417
18212. consitutional government	popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions cooperatives	communes socialized ownership world courts and the veto	power in world councils are but a few examples.	7.382881682205385
18213. most of these with	horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to	quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to	survive and enjoy it.	7.582549696191729
18214. the most effective political inventions seem to	make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters	can play only a minor part in the whole scheme.	10.620471545604497
18215. just as present	technology had to await the explanations of physics so one might	expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding.	6.843946676786641
18216. we are desperately in the need of such invention for man is	still very much at the mercy of man.	12.718905325481234
18217. in fact the accumulation of the	hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other.	8.766740256890932
18218. i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different	fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding	and fear.	10.557940657520286
18219. there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human	sciences which in themselves and even without political invention	can help to dispel our present fears.	7.663348434631507
18220. lucretius has remarked: the	reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all	sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause	and these they attribute to the will of god.	8.49472342254628
18221. perhaps things	were even worse then.	9.490649806045537
18222. it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears	of man.	18.673498007017482
18223. we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and	from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people	now than man ever was.	7.089896593205059
18224. we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in	the same way that people once feared comets.	12.166170213112272
18225. the bombs are as harmless	as an automobile in a garage.	8.929264111651635
18226. we are worried about what people may	do with them- that some crazy fool may push the button.	8.71159874179134
18227. i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human	fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific	explanations that stand out quite clearly.	7.403013213777069
18228. they are in general	those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual.	13.195780908333793
18229. they include both individual fears and collective ones.	9.266895627388028
18230. they arise	in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not	only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior	of the individual or group.	10.454270978563539
18231. often it is recognized that all the details	of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because	the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical	understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements	are effective and the whole pattern becomes ritualized.	7.057237254490424
18232. yet often	fear persists because even with the most rigid ritual one is never	quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or	that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive	act.	8.821300828246338
18233. to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates	the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much	of magic and superstition.	7.085409510556831
18234. but a somewhat more detailed analysis	of this process may be illuminating.	12.490699881350233
18235. the frequently postulated	antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness	apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize.	6.572629112625048
18236. it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly	cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people	to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice.	11.293910977313915
18237. this and other	fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the	ptolemaic	system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then more	firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could	account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions.	5.161321939499268
18238. this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one	can eliminate fear without instituting any controls.	11.679343667858678
18239. in fact although	we have dispelled the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves	that there are no dangers.	9.044395649505455
18240. there is still the remote possibility	of planetoid collision.	22.697149699971746
18241. a meteor could fall on san francisco.	8.317074339175358
18242. solar	activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought.	8.661173272272446
18243. our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our	former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which in this case	amounts to doing nothing.	7.066747950168018
18244. yet we no longer feel uneasy.	15.552108623379413
18245. this almost	trivial example is nevertheless suggestive for there are some elements	in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter	and shorter and our present fear of war.	6.485951917999143
18246. we in our country think	of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily	of our own doing.	10.636971733273993
18247. and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance	of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way	on the details of how we behave.	7.7060659188591565
18248. what elements of our behavior are decisive?	13.048509995569974
18249. 	our weapons production our world prestige our ideas of democracy	our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage?	5.412892111429394
18250. 	we have staved off a war and since our behavior has involved all	these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring	to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which	parts are effective.	8.735873312019022
18251. i think that we are here also talking of	the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching	at night along the streets of a large city.	9.808108990478061
18252. if an automobile	were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though	he might not be able to act quickly enough.	12.702130575793612
18253. with the group of boys	it is different.	12.296459651332437
18254. he does not know whether to look up or look aside	to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side to cross	the street or to continue on the same side.	10.63076222440045
18255. when confronted with	a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them	might do to me or to himself or to others.	7.789529670389175
18256. i believe that what i do	has some effect on his actions and i have learned in a way to commune	with drunks but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly	the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment	in physics.	10.032064259201915
18257. i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some	unwitting slip all hell may break loose.	7.696661034294925
18258. our inability to explain	why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of	ritual and malaise.	8.310186496052005
18259. we are forced in our behavior towards others to	adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a	minimal understanding of their essential elements.	7.312935352813954
18260. our collective	policies group and national are similarly based on voodoo but	here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still	engaged in determing them.	7.290166037717525
18261. we use terms from our personal experience	with individuals such as trust cheat and get tough.	7.602780080590948
18262. we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus	talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles.	11.92250677803926
18263. we	perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually	no understanding of social cause and effect.	5.88915352128452
18264. small wonder then	that we fear.	10.778787823975971
18265. the achievements which dispelled our fears of	the cosmos took place three centuries ago.	6.865690927705769
18266. what additional roles has	the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played?	10.769102993479128
18267. 	in the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry	and atomic physics.	5.377757918527215
18268. in the life sciences there has been an	enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of	heredity and in bio- and physiological chemistry.	10.428777086773966
18269. the major effect	of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the	industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding	has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment.	6.937431861731903
18270. in	addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also	changed.	10.14480917065495
18271. even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding	is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with	lightning and weather and earthquakes the appropriate kind of human action	has been more adequately indicated.	6.068522103396299
18272. apparently the population	as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations	of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears.	8.399858991977208
18273. how and	why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject	for study.	7.0553248207936825
18274. in some areas the progress is slower than in others.	16.322146269674665
18275. in	agriculture for example despite the advances in biology elaborate	rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence	of some natural disaster.	6.839713334406477
18276. in child care the opposite extreme prevails;	procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds	anything warranted by established psychological theory.	7.271542930450249
18277. there are	many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite	appropriate reduction in ritual and fear.	8.132718751768532
18278. much of the former extreme	uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death	has disappeared.	12.575990191587847
18279. the persistent horror of having a malformed child	has i believe been reduced not because we have gained any control	over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we	have so little control over it.	7.185391430054538
18280. in fact the recent warnings about the	use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which	now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance	science has momentarily aggravated our fears.	8.038071987491536
18281. in fact insofar as	science generates any fear it stems not so much from scientific prowess	and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise	which until they are understood create uncertainty.	7.147578746077261
18282. perhaps	the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding	is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease.	11.107607327709871
18283. the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease	contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect	to people.	7.817421409956024
18284. the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear	i have tried to describe.	13.743324561621732
18285. nothing like godot he arrived before the hour.	7.784748795929635
18286. his letter had	suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i came into	the lobby as the clock struck twelve.	8.903517895802505
18287. my wish	to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest	in his work.	5.92520160819056
18288. american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays	nihilistic.	9.93318324834399
18289. they find deep pessimism in them.	9.537619896033966
18290. even so astute a commentator	as harold clurman of the nation has said that waiting	for godot is the concentrate h of the contemporary european	h mood of despair.	10.560896535344014
18291. but to me beckett's writing had seemed	permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that	i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism.	6.798506017368466
18292. could it	be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me?	9.229619376275814
18293.  is his a literature of	defeat irrelevant to the social crises we face?	8.566504689252133
18294.  or is it relevant	because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?	10.793289136136178
18295. 	i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such	questions because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last	analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself.	6.906977646044116
18296. my curiosity was sharpened a day or two	before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher	of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious	drama near paris.	7.250857418830731
18297. when beckett's name came into the discussion	the priest	grew loud and told me that beckett hates life.	6.4289890941862975
18298. that	i thought is at least one thing i can find out when we meet.	14.43995062671679
18299. beckett's appearance is rough-hewn irish.	4.620788012408496
18300. the features of his face	are distinct but not fine.	12.616277681655118
18301. they look as if they had been sculptured	with an unsharpened chisel.	12.046108856543015
18302. unruly hair goes straight up from his	forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show	that it really is hair and not bristle.	8.49508290550161
18303. one might say it combines	the man; own pride and humility.	7.772401170898652
18304. for he has the pride that comes of	self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to	impose himself upon another.	9.273691295647243
18305. his light blue eyes set deep within the	face are actively and continually looking.	6.408079338810934
18306. he seems by some unconscious	division of labor to have given them that one function and no	other leaving communication to the rest of the face.	11.740503254685887
18307. the mouth frequently	breaks into a disarming smile.	8.690316122743438
18308. the voice is light in timbre with	a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.	9.626224026880294
18309. the irish accent is	as one would expect combined with slight inflections from the french.	7.048442365410204
18310. his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green.	9.32725717612956
18311. he wore a brown knit	sports shirt with no tie.	9.409625084585102
18312. we walked down the rue de l'arcade	thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe	opposite that church.	9.441605927761723
18313. the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing	but it could hardly be called world-shattering.	8.843189989677523
18314. for one thing	the world that beckett sees is already shattered.	13.078637596094113
18315. his talk turns to	what he calls the mess or sometimes this buzzing confusion.	7.09155691105704
18316. i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our	conversation.	10.637279978715137
18317. what appears here is shorter than what he actually said	but very close to his own words.	8.835159282012656
18318. the confusion is not my	invention.	15.238622060541287
18319. we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without	being acutely aware of the confusion.	8.937895733487961
18320. it is all around us and our	only chance now is to let it in.	18.74527038943492
18321. the only chance of renovation is to	open our eyes and see the mess.	8.613761222601008
18322. it is not a mess you can make sense of.	23.747477391932662
18323. i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth	but beckett did not take to the word truth.	13.24219114524779
18324. what is more	true than anything else?	14.978375911147628
18325.  to swim is true and to sink is true.	9.458296668483937
18326. one is not more true than the other.	19.511915403295877
18327. one cannot speak anymore of being	one must speak only of the mess.	8.49134942171676
18328. when heidegger and sartre speak	of a contrast between being and existence they may be right i don't	know but their language is too philosophical for me.	7.820805055910115
18329. i am not a	philosopher.	17.46263240992198
18330. one can only speak of what is in front of him and that	now is simply the mess.	17.21240720182583
18331. then he began to speak about the tension	in art between the mess and form.	8.823788775122788
18332. until recently art has withstood	the pressure of chaotic things.	10.248050852813673
18333. it has held them at bay.	16.558217852357686
18334. it realized	that to admit them was to jeopardize form.	13.84634130305995
18335. how could the mess	be admitted because it appears to be the very opposite of form and	therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be?	8.952911928023317
18336. 	but now we can keep it out no longer because we have come into a	time when it invades our experience at every moment.	9.092598671559404
18337. it is there	and it must be allowed in.	16.61087631243926
18338. i granted this might be so but	found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.	14.49832532439479
18339. and why not?	13.990458972083232
18340.  how i asked could chaos be admitted to	chaos?	11.92073980249739
18341.  would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?	13.641851159214662
18342. 	if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form.	8.67544844058248
18343. beckett's	own work is an example.	5.7782582884025615
18344. plays more highly formalized than waiting	for godot endgame and krapp's last tape would	be hard to find.	6.386906463994053
18345. what i am saying does not mean that there	will henceforth be no form in art.	9.591598280673841
18346. it only means that there will	be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admits	the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something	else.	12.72406197487219
18347. the form and the chaos remain separate.	14.262827380503651
18348. the latter is not reduced	to the former.	15.575609142480214
18349. that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation	because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates.	9.137620758617146
18350. to find a form that accommodates the mess that is the task of	the artist now.	13.602378952846927
18351. yet i responded could not similar things	be said about the art of the past?	10.214289041838649
18352.  is it not characteristic of the	greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify	demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable	way?	10.897615937503701
18353.  what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting	to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow	themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic	theory?	9.731608778766352
18354.  isn't all art ambiguous?	4.849245606624035
18355.    not this he said	and gestured toward the madeleine.	8.872302625253251
18356. the classical lines of the church	which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory dominated all	the scene where we sat.	10.321283967926417
18357. the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard	malesherbes and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery	bearing tidings of the age of reason.	6.633334201914706
18358. this does not allow the mystery to invade us.	17.7606092157601
18359. with classical art	all is settled.	9.963826146405346
18360. but it is different at chartres.	28.072200282582777
18361. there is the unexplainable	and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to	answer.	13.394249812106128
18362. i asked about the battle between life and death in	his plays.	15.298013243843348
18363. didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide; hamm's	world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living	child outside.	7.01210145083897
18364. is this life-death question a part of the chaos?	14.784160306022997
18365. 	yes.	12.348350321510317
18366. if life and death did not both present themselves to	us there would be no inscrutability.	13.009468525441008
18367. if there were only darkness all	would be clear.	15.509685426909073
18368. it is because there is not only darkness but also	light that our situation becomes inexplicable.	18.894624256454563
18369. take augustine's doctrine	of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic	qualities in this theology?	4.58231074074962
18370.  two thieves are crucified with christ	one saved and the other damned.	9.50847867020731
18371. how can we make sense of this	division?	13.423920874057261
18372.  in classical drama such problems do not arise.	13.285285462448554
18373. the destiny	of racine's phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed	into the dark.	4.479926859873427
18374. as she goes she herself will be illuminated.	14.713461834527171
18375. at	the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end	she has complete illumination but there has been no question but that	she moves toward the dark.	8.35476912233692
18376. within this notion clarity	is possible but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there	is not such clarity.	9.108903285208223
18377. the question would also be removed if we believed	in the contrary- total salvation.	7.489418612140449
18378. but where we have both dark	and light we have also the inexplicable.	13.700478434277205
18379. the key word in my plays is	'perhaps'.	10.82157316241308
18380. given a theological lead i asked what he	thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.	9.746657304414416
18381. well really there is none at all.	10.296230913368117
18382. i have no religious feeling.	21.93231644779453
18383. once i had a religious emotion.	13.015328818714341
18384. it was at my first communion.	22.367805231083164
18385. my mother was deeply religious.	9.305890210279884
18386. he knelt	down at his bed as long as he could kneel.	14.006541687825766
18387. the	family was protestant but for me it was only irksome and i let it	go.	7.795017892730625
18388. my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they	died.	9.65507485013211
18389. at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school	tie.	13.870432350248908
18390. irish catholicism is not attractive but it is deeper.	12.009782598356567
18391. when	you pass a church on an irish bus all the hands flurry in the sign of	the cross.	7.643244875485836
18392. one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps	also the pigs.	13.079440984506904
18393. but do the plays deal with the same facets	of experience religion must also deal with?	9.728583460106636
18394.    yes for they	deal with distress.	12.208430212992267
18395. some people object to this in my writing.	10.05392946709415
18396. at a	party an english intellectual- so-called- asked me why i write	always about distress.	7.615631048218582
18397. as if it were perverse to do so! he wanted	to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home	to give me an unhappy childhood.	6.890476393695212
18398. i told him no that i had had a very	happy childhood.	17.60795112500093
18399. then he thought me more perverse than ever.	9.346855936800388
18400. i left	the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi.	16.16196772974749
18401. on the glass partition	between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help	for the blind another help for orphans and the third for relief for	the war refugees.	6.259098675339486
18402. one does not have to look for distress.	21.63167796533509
18403. it is screaming	at you even in the taxis of london.	13.135842873899287
18404. lunch was over	and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming	at us.	11.26758180533136
18405. the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar	to qualities i had found in the plays.	7.985709908003346
18406. he says nothing that compresses	experience within a closed pattern.	14.713513859374812
18407. perhaps stands in	place of commitment.	10.380738114970821
18408. at the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly	friendly.	22.258437918170355
18409. if there were only the mess all would be clear; but	there is also compassion.	9.632276285226595
18410. as a christian i know i do not	stand where beckett stands but i do see much of what he sees.	13.096029653668781
18411. as a	writer on the theater i have paid close attention to the plays.	8.961326540697318
18412. harold	clurman is right to say that waiting for godot is a reflection	of the impasse and disarray	of europe's present politics ethic and common way of life.	7.729515155480995
18413. yet it is not only europe the play refers to.	14.632116145437164
18414. waiting for godot	sells even better in america than in france.	10.952736750313433
18415. the consciousness	it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america but it	is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when	their successes in technological and economic systematization propel	them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.	5.6768279554381325
18416. america is now joining europe in this mature phase of development.	10.301633389615347
18417. whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens	as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going	on in the countries of asia and africa and also of course on how long	the cold war remains cold.	8.897699898325941
18418. even hemingway for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality	in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never	maintained that sex was all.	8.93811535317244
18419. hemingway's fiction is supported by a	moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at	a religious dimension.	5.092270649200748
18420. and d h lawrence in fantasia of the	unconscious protested vehemently against the overestimation of	the sexual motive.	8.008137655883536
18421. though sex in some form or other enters into all human	activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect	of human nature it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of	sex.	7.566401792031457
18422. all is not sex declared lawrence.	13.480114235271932
18423. man is not confined	to one outlet for his vital energy.	9.65225522076327
18424. the creative urge for example	transcends the body and the self.	11.310025845610944
18425. but for the beat generation	all is sex.	13.663153200320188
18426. nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary	aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex.	13.432818519168867
18427. for	the beatnik like the hipster is in opposition to a society that is based	on the repression of the sex instinct.	7.7291830411724165
18428. he has elevated sex- not	eros or libido but pure spontaneous uninhibited sex- to the rank	of the godhead; it is astarte ishtar venus yahwe dionysus	christ the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the	body of the universe.	5.571606768727589
18429. jazz is sex marijuana is a stimulus to sex the	beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.	7.905630295727826
18430. lawrence lipton in the holy barbarians stresses that for	the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a	mystique and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities	of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe	of discourse.	8.61858200282944
18431. the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against	the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in	a public place.	6.32180020914881
18432. the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression	of ungratified sexual desire.	10.055860890997664
18433. for this reason too their language	is more forthright and earthy.	9.470664463759316
18434. the beatniks crave a sexual experience	in which their whole being participates.	9.463716165911533
18435. it is therefore not	surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity	for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.	7.6070980265981785
18436. they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy	the precepts of legalized propriety.	9.659538667227872
18437. unlike the heroes and flappers	of the lost generation they disdain the art of necking and petting.	6.705246657739083
18438. that is reserved for the squares.	20.160248016637265
18439. if they avoid the use	of the pungent outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo;	it is sacred.	8.976482635495588
18440. as lipton the prophet of the beat generation declares:	in the sexual act the beat are filled with mana the divine	power.	9.927171413678197
18441. this is far from the vulgar leering sexuality of the middle-class	square in heat.	9.46735642408475
18442. this is the holy grail these knights of	the orgasm pursue this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they	respond.	12.112414310116785
18443. if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out	of the egypt of sexual slavery dylan thomas is the poet who offers	them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence	in liquor marijuana sex and jazz.	6.0613221841412726
18444. in addition they have been converted	to zen buddhism with its glorification of all that is natural	and mysteriously alive the sense that everything in the world	is flowing.	11.943868745961298
18445. thus paradoxically the beat writers resort to religious	metaphors: they are in search of mana the spiritual the numinous	but not anything connected with formal religion.	6.154540089092583
18446. what they are	after is the beatific vision.	13.810322034212462
18447. and zen buddhism though it is extremely	difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled	helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through	sexual release.	7.049772086148438
18448. the style of life chosen by the beat generation	the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own	is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience.	10.560471152465295
18449. jazz is	good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided	sexual effect.	8.825324809852077
18450. jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of	the orgasm; indeed it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz	by freeing the listener of his inhibitions can have therapeutic	value.	8.24619584382785
18451. that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of	jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it.	8.544341883906567
18452. instead of giving themselves	spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they	undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes	for satisfaction.	9.332437403423356
18453. thus jazz is transmuted into something holy the	sacred road to integration of being.	6.810897433515415
18454. jazz like sex is a mystique.	12.508243806692533
18455. it	is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative	impulse in unfettered man.	8.139269378820162
18456. the mystique of sex combined with	marijuana and jazz is intended to provide a design for living.	10.216307751023667
18457. those	who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free their	instincts put at the service of the imagination.	6.870778253538462
18458. righteous in their	denunciation of all that makes for death the beat prophets bid all	men become cool cats; let them learn to swing freely to let	go to become authentically themselves and then perhaps civilization	will be saved.	6.963757199296916
18459. the beatnik seceding from a society that is fatally	afflicted with a deathward drive is concerned with his personal salvation	in the living present.	7.649252317641505
18460. if he is the child of nothingness if he	is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars then he will consult	only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil.	10.100322729207399
18461. he will not	curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that	makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief	moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.	7.2791040002200305
18462. that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the	title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines temples	museums and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the	life they believe in.	11.88028535119301
18463. apart from the categorical imperative they derive	from the metaphysics of the orgasm the only affirmation they are	capable of making is that art is their only refuge.	7.1479838702821725
18464. their writing	born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality reflects	the extremity of their existential alienation.	8.01759533660313
18465. the mind has betrayed	them reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical	sensations the wisdom of the body the holy promptings of the unconscious.	6.233329227027743
18466. with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate but their	faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz culminates	in the climax of the orgasm.	9.491489789015098
18467. their work mirrors the mentality	of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible.	6.595029645933983
18468. their rebellion against	authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt	characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.	10.18005083005263
18469. and the life they	lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive even though	they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit-	writing painting music.	7.267888747989513
18470. they are non-conformists on principle.	12.465963721244446
18471. when	they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth	the rage of repudiation the ecstasy of negation.	5.663768264560031
18472. it is sex that obsesses	them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.	17.217734017033393
18473. what	they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can	inspire the muse.	6.887407999765336
18474. monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful	middle class continue to suffer whereas the beatnik has the courage	to break out of that prison of respectability.	8.634017714398642
18475. one girl describes	her past her succession of broken marriages the abortions she has	had	and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she	must justify her passion.	6.149996524847463
18476. if it is an honest feeling then why should	she not yield to it?	15.153277346228865
18477.  most often she says it's the	monogamous relationship that is dishonest.	5.436824969895068
18478. there is nothing	holy in wedlock.	27.8709435990424
18479. this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist	who disapproves of her life.	7.196513147236122
18480. she finds married life stifling and every	prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.	9.4234580420194
18481. this confession	serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution:	the craving for sensation for its own sake the need for change	for new experiences.	6.331653505682663
18482. in the realm of physical sensations	sex reigns supreme.	16.19489255301145
18483. hence the beatniks sustain themselves on	marijuana jazz free swinging poetry exhausting themselves in orgies	of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and	lose contact with reality.	5.616020407382185
18484. one beat poet composes a poem lines on	a tijuana john which contains a few happy hints for survival.	8.374819321087053
18485. the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must	move toward simplicity.	8.665681539213123
18486. the professed mission of this disaffiliated	generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry	and fiction but what they produce is unfortunately disordered nourished	solely on the hysteria of negation.	10.101948420253365
18487. who are the creative	representatives of this movement?	10.395439415516346
18488.  nymphomaniacs junkies homosexuals	drug addicts lesbians alcoholics the weak the frustrated	the irresolute the despairing the derelicts and outcasts of society.	6.287185727271976
18489. they embrace independent poverty usually with a shack-up partner	who will help support them.	5.979540269349742
18490. they are full of contempt for the institution	of matrimony.	12.355142989702076
18491. their previous legalized marriages do not count	for they hold the laws of the state null and void.	7.193453535358266
18492. they feel they	are leagued against a hostile persecutory world faced with the concerted	malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings the police.	8.847466855922073
18493. this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending	their way of life their search for wholeness though their actual existence	fails to reach these religious heights.	8.031310133119597
18494. one beatnik got	the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and	all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up.	8.252031562083477
18495. what	obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk?	6.698639549230932
18496.  sex	as the creative principle of the universe the secret of primitive religion	the life of myth.	10.47113343347479
18497. everything in the final analysis reduced itself	to sexual symbolism.	8.495492566411684
18498. in his chapter on the loveways of the	beat generation lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details.	10.127053801284294
18499. no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west	venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the	group.	8.428781754543168
18500. the women who come to west venice having forsaken radicalism	are interested in living only for the moment in being constantly	on the move.	10.919901818932285
18501. others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat	generation are homosexuals heroin addicts and smalltime hoodlums.	6.077662979054747
18502. those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.	11.993007287500571
18503. since the homosexuals widely use marijuana they do not have to be	initiated.	11.099700665021489
18504. part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana.	23.245082047273723
18505. as lipton	puts it: the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana	with far greater force as a unifying principle in human relationships	than at any other time except perhaps in the mutual metaphysical	orgasms.	5.8395965314682385
18506. the magic circle is in fact a symbol of and preparation for	the metaphysical orgasm.	13.601756053753466
18507. under the influence of marijuana the beatnik	comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense	of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being.	8.17145107127309
18508. carried high on this charge he composes magical poetry	that captures the organic rhythms of life in words.	8.906449851627539
18509. if he thus achieves	a lyrical dreamlike drugged intensity he pays the price for his	indulgence by producing work- allen ginsberg's howl is	a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented dionysian	but without depth and without apollonian control.	4.849279403506456
18510. for drugs are in	themselves no royal road to creativity.	10.589717657722629
18511. how is the beat poet to achieve	unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic	derangement of senses.	10.705650402037381
18512. if love reflects the nature of man as	ortega y gasset believes if the person in love betrays decisively what	he is by his behavior in love then the writers of the beat generation	are creating a new literary genre.	9.48104599991465
18513. there were fences in the old days when we were children.	14.932250269106968
18514. across	the front of a yard and down the side they were iron either spiked	along the top or arched in half circles.	9.91304388358054
18515. alley fences were made	of solid boards higher than one's head but not so high as the golden	glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them.	6.034801276709093
18516. side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front	fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle.	5.754243230398181
18517. square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of	cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail:	high-pitched roof pinnacle and narrow gable.	3.3447504659626297
18518. on these posts	the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.	10.062365185755272
18519. the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences	was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree.	6.732024548487832
18520. the primary	quality of that view seems now to have been its quietness but that	cannot at the time have impressed us.	10.526750310608874
18521. what one actually remembers	is its greenness.	9.409529722806056
18522. from high in the tree the whole block lay within	range of the eye but the ground was almost nowhere visible.	9.947352623948731
18523. one looked	down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower.	8.870016698559272
18524. every path from	back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor and every yard had its	fruit trees.	6.978213042257712
18525. in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers	had planted syringa and sweet-shrub snowball rose-of-sharon and	balm-of-gilead.	7.2147576997227825
18526. from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse	of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham	skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor	or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter	of garments hung there half-way down the block.	6.706414985283534
18527. that was one	epoch: the apple-tree epoch.	7.662280974846714
18528. another had ended before it began.	12.196462381802986
18529. time	is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays	with memory and memory with time are queerest of all.	5.016447512851973
18530. from maturity	one looks back at the succession of years counts them and makes them	many yet cannot feel length in the number however large.	9.505538802704026
18531. in a	stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond	is quiet its surface dark and shadowed and there does not seem to	be much water in it.	5.329461711452462
18532. time in the sum is nothing.	17.153540367000776
18533. and yet- a year to	a child is an eternity and in the memory that phase of one's being-	a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning	and without end.	4.6250381198689166
18534. the part of the mind that preserves dates and	events may remonstrate it could have been like that for only a	little while; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds	fast to things that were and they are outside of time.	9.59679835461274
18535. once	then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was	bound round by fences when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough	to twist my knee over it and pull myself up.	5.629101429089298
18536. that world was in	scale with my own smallness.	12.302752372095688
18537. i have no picture in my mind of the garden	as a whole- that i could not see- but certain aspects of certain	corners linger in the memory: wind-blown frost-bitten white chrysanthemums	beneath a window with their brittle brown leaves and their	sharp scent of november; ripe pears lying in long grass to be turned	over by a dusty-slippered foot cautiously lest bees still worked	in the ragged brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner	between the dining-room wall and the side porch where we passed on	our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother	for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.	4.441814494378068
18538. it was	mother who planted the verbenas.	16.115212124137823
18539. i think that my grandmother was not	an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and	grandchildren.	7.485111198339298
18540. my great-grandmother i have been told made her garden	her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders	in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to	be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with	common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed	and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.	6.4579901414120435
18541. these my	grandmother left in their places	and planted others like	them that flourished without careful tending.	6.127887649177441
18542. three of these only	were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses whose petals	might not be collected until they had fallen to be made into perfume	or rose-tea to drink; the peonies whose tight sticky buds would	be blighted by the laying on of a finger although they were not apparently	harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies.	6.07473258583963
18543. i	have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer	morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than	my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap unfolded and shook out	like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals.	4.894715875163003
18544. other flowers	we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath	the lilacs; the lilacs themselves that bloomed so prodigally but	for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms	that	turned upside down make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little	dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.	4.992641744673459
18545. more	potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a	few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae	which are of the very stuff of the mind intrinsic because they	were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that	held them.	7.561629432204865
18546. flowers stones and small creatures living and dead.	9.294546483541142
18547. pale	yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods	of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow	columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and	eaten	for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped	and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers	from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten	waggling fingers.	3.626227669238282
18548. fuzzy caterpillars snails with their sensitive horns	struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded	to spit tobacco spit.	6.851574250171144
18549. dead fledgling birds their squashed-looking	nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they	had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags.	6.754803270642292
18550. and	the	cast shell of a locust straw-colored and transparent weighing nothing	fragile but entire with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down	its back.	6.522416990649305
18551. every morning early in the summer we searched the trunks	of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells carefully	detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung and stabled	them a weird faery herd in an angle between the high roots of the	tulip tree where no grass grew in the dense shade h.	5.6492220497121615
18552. we collected	lucky stones- all the creamy translucent pebbles worn smooth	and round that we could find in the driveway.	7.751041370360318
18553. when these had been	pocketed we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles	for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their	dull exteriors indicated.	5.992461315335978
18554. we showed them to each other and said would	you have guessed h?	13.031793854541407
18555.  squatting on our haunches beside the	flat stone we broke them on we were safe behind the high closed gates	at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation	and possible amusement of the passers-by.	5.63604263806401
18556. thus shielded we played	many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the	fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post	was the sleeping beauty's enchanted castle or when rapunzel let	down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire even then we paid	little heed to those who went by on the path outside.	6.305422740988773
18557. we enjoyed	a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school.	8.145403722444529
18558. in	the heat of the summer the garden solitudes were ours alone; our	elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch.	9.223534738247105
18559. they	never troubled themselves about us while we were playing because	the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside	the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation.	4.599260232974476
18560. we were	not however entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street.	11.341759008493622
18561. we were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they sag on their	hinges in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on them when they	were latched rest our chins on the top and stare and stare committing	to memory quite unintentionally all the details that lay before	our eyes.	5.590457825167091
18562. the street that is full now of traffic and parked	cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade	of the curbside trees and silence was a weight almost palpable	in the air.	8.750943376646168
18563. every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell	away again crushed beneath it.	5.998954308303826
18564. a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter	the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees and loose	straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves.	7.5488120730238775
18565. a wheel squeaked	on a hub was still and squeaked again.	6.86891258852641
18566. if a child watched its progress	he whispered hay hay load of hay- make a wish and turn	away and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the	sound of the horses' feet returned no more.	7.095405818033591
18567. when the hay wagon had	gone and an interval passed a huckster's cart might turn the corner.	6.552797912710469
18568. the horse walked the reins were slack the huckster rode with bowed	shoulders his forearms across his knees.	8.202764364161137
18569. sleepily as if half-reluctant	to break the silence he lifted his voice: rhu-beb-ni-ice	fresh rhu-beb today! the lazy sing-song was spaced in time	like the drone of a bumble-bee.	3.4658851780704913
18570. no one seemed to hear him no one heeded.	14.029294971550625
18571. the horse plodded on and he repeated his call.	9.006664165365628
18572. it became so monotonous	as to seem a part of the quietness.	19.654637914014273
18573. after his passage the street	was empty again.	9.267509857868387
18574. the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down;	the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk from sidewalk	to lawn.	6.34535325781374
18575. at four-o'clock or four-thirty the coming of the newsboy	marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front	door and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read	what their neighbors had been doing.	5.913005256437783
18576. the streets of any county	town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were	like this fifty-odd years ago and yesterday.	7.211064690401435
18577. but the fences were still	in place fifty-odd years ago and when we stood on the gate to look	over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving	stones with grass between and on both sides.	6.575727334506738
18578. the curb was a line	of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost	in the ground or the roots of trees.	10.158875491112942
18579. opposite every gate was a hitching	post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tying	a horse.	5.270161679774294
18580. the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center;	it was mud in wet weather and dust ankle-deep in dry and could	be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones.	6.951327499712408
18581. it had	a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since.	11.260663727191584
18582. the hoofmarks of	cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as	numerous as the traces of shod horses.	9.96186283421152
18583. cows were kept in backyard barns	boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge	of town and familiar to the ear morning and evening were the boys'	coaxing voices the thud of hooves and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.	5.795970861422377
18584. it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story	because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and	makes of them a curious riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant	for mann's work.	9.24835769554513
18585. the wife amra and her lover are	both savagely portrayed she as incarnate sensuality voluptuous	and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind	of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike	brain.	5.5139030434806955
18586. la^utner for his part belonged to the present-day	race of small artists who do not demand the utmost of themselves	and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets	as wretched little poseurs the devastating indictment they	do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat	extreme prophecy so far not fulfilled: they will be destroyed.	7.29565233622208
18587. the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want	not simply of decency but of imagination as well.	6.368040210137069
18588. his appearance as	lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle	absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed	by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation.	6.732289649970212
18589. at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat	man as girl and as baby as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches	for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby's	upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human	life.	6.150546177794011
18590. the music which la^utner has composed for this episode	is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal.	9.611547323998598
18591. but	it is characteristic of him we are told his little artifice	to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of	hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art.	6.6707547924969814
18592. and this occurs	now at the refrain of jacoby's song- at the point in fact of	the name lizzy-; a modulation described as almost a stroke	of genius.	7.579575754486931
18593. a miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly	torn away to reveal something nude.	7.0323659834206955
18594. it is this modulation	which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously	his wife's infidelity.	10.365188937214448
18595. by the same means he perceives this fact	as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses and dies.	5.910843031505695
18596. in the work of every artist i suppose there may be found	one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive	ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly	so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of	thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment.	8.812176354833378
18597. the horrifying humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke	gone wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore	dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the	bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent	mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional	touch of genius	; the miraculous way in which music revelation	and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems	a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself; beyond itself	also	it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of mann's	work.	4.747529664016639
18598. when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that	this passage is of critical significance i come up with the following	ideas which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in	a later essay.	9.944211545016035
18599. love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann's	heroes.	8.694842973532493
18600. the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically	turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled	and forbidden to love.	9.142822770381112
18601. the release the freedom involved in loving	another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible;	and the motion toward it brings disaster.	5.847011613868741
18602. this prohibition	on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly	the artist who suffers	from it.	7.361111786807562
18603. the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem	of the breakthrough in the realm of art.	8.645297461854886
18604. again the sufferings	and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment	not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another	with childhood with the figure of a child.	9.47569452720201
18605. finally the	theatrical notions of dressing up cosmetics	disguise and especially change of costume	are characteristically associated with the catastrophes	of mann's stories.	5.515920867260124
18606. we shall return to these statements	and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.	11.441846827675173
18607. for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of	jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together	in prophetic parody.	8.796302063850737
18608. professionally a lawyer that is to say associated	with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially	middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself	dressed up disguised- that is paradoxically revealed- as a	child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child.	6.638216513538118
18609. that this abandonment	takes place on a stage during an 'artistic' performance	is enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the	punishment for art; that is he is suspect guilty punishable as	is anyone in mann's stories who produces illusion and this is	true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature technique	magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between jacoby	and la^utner.	5.102256000971279
18610. it appears that the dominant tendency of	mann's early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface	is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic.	7.715444562113812
18611. in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his	stories are one and the same.	9.314406569685364
18612. something of this can be learned	from the way to the churchyard an anecdote about	an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die	of a stroke or seizure.	9.961135967112618
18613. there is no more plot than that; only	slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident	would give.	8.700892947170132
18614. the artistic interest then lies in what the encounter	may be made to represent in the power of some central significance	to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.	9.534819754444209
18615. the first	sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent:	the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran	beside it all the way to the end; that is to say to the churchyard.	7.685732084742137
18616. and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction.	14.327330682473434
18617. the highroad one might say at first belongs to life while	the way to the churchyard belongs to death.	10.988550717490568
18618. but that is too simple	and won't hold up.	12.073757919474843
18619. as the first sentence suggests both roads belong	to death in the end.	9.988737181290928
18620. but the highroad according to the description	of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death	while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life:	a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness	of death.	10.839405322021655
18621. thus on the highroad a troop of soldiers marched in their	own dust and sang while on the footpath one man walks alone.	6.650745254813522
18622. this man's isolation is not merely momentary it is permanent.	8.37712304180722
18623. he is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on	earth; also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account.	7.659090881485638
18624. his	name is praisegod piepsam and he is rather fully described as to	his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister	type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic	strangers in death in venice for example who represent	some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp.	7.316869575146381
18625. this strange	person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path	rather than the highroad.	8.096939137537106
18626. the cyclist a sufficiently commonplace	young fellow is not named but identified simply as life- that	and a license number which piepsam uses in addressing him.	7.298244492280682
18627. life	points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride	on.	6.600712374060658
18628. piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest	from life and is left standing in impotent and growing rage	while a crowd begins to gather.	8.788442779488985
18629. his rage assumes a religious form;	that is on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness	piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god	imprecates doom on life- not only the cyclist now but the audience	the world as well: all you light-headed breed.	5.225637757665669
18630. this passion	brings on a fit which proves fatal.	11.448539027114274
18631. then an ambulance comes along	and they drive praisegod piepsam away.	7.496036498161864
18632. this is simple enough	but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant.	12.841788598570242
18633. the	season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree	aspect.	8.63555863149278
18634. piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot	stop the cyclist but also because god will not stop him; as piepsam	says to the crowd in his last moments: his justice is not of	this world.	6.8742687392325275
18635. life is further characterized in antithesis to	piepsam as animal: the image of a dog which appears at several	places is first given as the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest	aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon	is admirable a pleasure to contemplate; another wagon	has no dog and therefore is devoid of interest.	5.064491419578089
18636. piepsam calls	the cyclist cur and puppy among other things and at the crisis	of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into	his face.	7.797612682838607
18637. the ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses.	8.044697072050106
18638. piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense.	11.783773413018311
18639. his religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with	his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical.	5.235608474146543
18640. his unsuccessful	strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings;	he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe praisegod	piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in	his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated.	7.651819822404452
18641. the cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed is simply	unreflective unproblematic life blithe and carefree.	5.438460635893768
18642. he	made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth.	10.48926954617721
18643. piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous	and trivial.	6.07659643059624
18644. he is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard.	23.742250355336832
18645. but he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from	the highroad to watch him more interesting than life considered	as a cyclist.	8.992049096230959
18646. and if i have gone into so much detail about so small	a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the	germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann's writing:	the crude sketch of piepsam contains in its critical destructive	and self-destructive tendencies much that is enlarged and illuminated	in the figures of for instance naphta and leverku^hn.	8.091139268012762
18647. in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details	selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism	anticipates a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional	composition in which as leverku^hn says there shall be	nothing unthematic.	7.5465452352842
18648. it resembles too pictures such as du^rer	and bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial	proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a	proverb for example or a deadly sin.	8.481642817620344
18649. gladius dei	resembles the way to the churchyard in its representation	of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit	of criticism negation melancholy but it goes considerably further	in characterizing the elements of this conflict.	7.1563067715097555
18650. the monk savonarola	brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background	of munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious	works displayed in the art-shop of m bluthenzweig; in	particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled	according to gossip upon the painter's mistress.	7.179336907059023
18651. hieronymus	like piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though	not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out	of the shop by the porter.	4.863664343825003
18652. on the street outside hieronymus envisions	a holocaust of the vanities of this world such a burning of artistic	and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in	florence and prophetically he issues his curse: gladius dei	super terram cito et velociter.	6.929845001385013
18653. the reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their	art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and	empty world.	6.68215572296009
18654. their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.	11.992814863833974
18655. these polar concerns reflect	a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing	over a long period of time.	8.417035685743096
18656. the breakdown of classical structures of	meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations	of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.	9.356235903816719
18657. thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal	and spiritual qualities and complete objectification in sub-human and	quasi-mechanistic powers.	6.6406501187395115
18658. the image of the world tends to reflect the	hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces	and overwhelming mystery.	11.936371598392437
18659. the image of god has simply disappeared.	16.163250433656742
18660. all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory	response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism:	if man can neither know nor love reality as it is he can at	least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which	can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable	of being known and worthy of being loved.	8.455426497068375
18661. the person of the artist	becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by	the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical	systems.	7.311776256894099
18662. whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and	whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding	the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually	exclusive that they belong together.	8.71464568262661
18663. without the decay of a	sense of objective reference the	stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into	being.	6.5141404444885564
18664. and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves	insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar	authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously	and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid	chapters in the philosophy of art may be written.	9.89758714153142
18665. for better or worse	we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of	classical rationalism or detached realism.	7.574980077212097
18666. a broader concept of imitation	is needed one which acknowledges that true invention is important	that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic	causal factors out of which it arises.	6.842645588826892
18667. on the other hand we cannot regard	artistic invention as pure uncaused and unrelated to the times	in which it occurs.	8.458490636117899
18668. we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from	the solipsism and futility of pure formalism.	11.741182591554107
18669. accordingly it is the	aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation	call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of	and a new theory of invention	.	6.9917545144896325
18670. the arts	the word mimesis is usually associated	with plato and aristotle.	10.168922450478734
18671. for plato imitation is twice	removed from reality being a poor copy of physical appearance which	in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence.	7.621638953349807
18672. all artistic and mythological	representations therefore are imitations of imitations and	are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic the	proper use of the inquiring intellect.	8.653899709798342
18673. in plato's judgment the	arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young	prior to the full development of their intellectual powers.	7.016177771008917
18674. presupposed	in plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight in which	a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating	to the most sublime wisdom.	7.259179045760733
18675. aristotle also tended to stratify all	aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and	like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.	6.24348817909003
18676. the poetics in affirming that all human arts are modes	of imitation gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than	did plato.	8.374905168627656
18677. but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented	it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and	action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and	important human truths.	7.961866444650516
18678. for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis	in contrast to the power of dialectic is relatively incapable of	expressing the character of fundamental reality.	11.608472326041575
18679. the central	concern of erich auerbach's impressive volume called mimesis	is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation	to a christian theory of imitation	in which the levels are dissolved.	5.313694819532106
18680. following the theme of incarnation	in the gospels the christian artist and critic sees in the most	commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality.	8.464438129427462
18681. here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation	in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent.	7.046725936186148
18682. artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement	of all persons however humble in a divine drama.	7.639139232562272
18683. the artist unlike	the philosopher is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified	high levels of abstraction.	7.23558800596223
18684. he is the conveyor of a sacred reality	by which he has been grasped.	14.774206371812813
18685. i have chosen to use the word mimesis	in its christian rather than its classic implications and	to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological	expression which as in the christian mind are the direct consequence	of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved	as in the greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection.	6.849883225634387
18686. in the first instance mimesis is here used to mean the	recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms	of abstract ideas or conventional designations.	11.986482969986161
18687. by image is meant	not only a visual presentation but also remembered sensations of any	of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined	therewith.	6.0216735664997865
18688. this is the primary function of the imagination operating	in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images	were first appropriated.	13.844304246306196
18689. mimesis is the nearest possible thing to	the actual re-living of experience in which the imagining person recovers	through images something of the force and depth characteristic	of experience itself.	6.251459172617916
18690. the images themselves like their counterparts	in experience are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately;	they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities	and a unique relatedness to one another.	7.2878130335138565
18691. they bring an inextricable	component of value within themselves with attractions and repulsions	native to their own quality.	7.755886024658223
18692. as in experience one is seized by	given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in	value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation	of images.	9.245268280538292
18693. mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism	or realism in the conventional sense.	9.101459936275674
18694. a word taken in its dictionary	meaning a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing	of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote	such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without	the incitement of value feelings.	7.727103570788124
18695. similarly experience itself can	be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues	for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential	field.	6.804379957760121
18696. a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection	to a sense of immediacy.	10.009212568731728
18697. the mimetic character of the	imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation	of artistic forms and materials.	6.926394363054478
18698. when words can be used in a more fresh	and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and	sounds when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape	all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of	themselves compelling the observer into an attitude of attention all	this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes	upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance.	8.743674504090796
18699. these	are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self	and thrusts the self into decision and choice.	7.759914705736477
18700. the presence of genuine	mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work	demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely	understood.	11.617892308506246
18701. underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain	presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which	require some exposition before the main argument can proceed.	5.86148404896363
18702. experience	is not seen as it is in classical rationalism as presenting	us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space	and	registering their character movements and changes on the tabula	rasa of an uninvolved intellect.	8.464388276622099
18703. neither is primary experience understood	according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing	is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing	their responses in the appropriate sense organs.	7.294522182756205
18704. primary feelings	of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects	nor a collection of isolated and	neutral sensory qualities.	8.67798633726296
18705. in contrast to all this primary data are	data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.	8.484371629007835
18706. the	most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings both positive	and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment	into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other	part.	8.069057249937343
18707. these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers	in which one is involved some working for one's good others threatening	ill.	5.44275550425274
18708. gone is the tabula rasa of the mind.	9.463792759748301
18709. in its place	is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive	or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined	by constellations of process in which one is caught.	5.595637872745073
18710. the principal	defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy	is alfred north whitehead.	10.885632308009427
18711. our most elemental and unavoidable	impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of	powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated	in a vast movement through the present toward the future.	6.618812938838088
18712. we feel the	quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening.	11.568712617615871
18713. later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors	of judgment in these apprehensions of value but the apprehensions themselves	are the primary stuff of experience.	6.140217710229164
18714. it takes a great deal	of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger	unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a	collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern	devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far	as they present themselves for inspection.	8.328320575405098
18715. whitehead is here questioning	david hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he	is questioning also every epistemology which stems from hume's	presupposition	that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from	causal efficacy and that causal efficacy is something intellectually	imputed to the world not directly perceived.	5.350161095211279
18716. what hume calls sensation	is what whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational	immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception	in the mode of causal efficacy.	9.83312358760077
18717. as long as perception is seen as	composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness	of existence loses its objectivity becomes an invention	of consciousness and the result is a philosophical scepticism.	8.346849528921323
18718. whitehead	contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity	of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other	and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because	the basic form of such an understanding for all its vagueness and	tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man	feels the world.	9.160081905564251
18719. in this respect experience is broader and full of	a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of	his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct.	7.584965925063404
18720. a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is	one of derivation from the past.	12.399090497334246
18721. both i and my feelings come up out	of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are	ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am.	6.90060526765724
18722. after only eighteen years of non-interference there were already indications	of melioration though in a slight degree to be sure.	8.34788705499268
18723. there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century.	11.302869291550808
18724. i leave	it to the statisticians to say what they were but i noticed several	a few years ago during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg.	10.682285445532573
18725. in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school	and the white school and in every instance the former made a better	appearance.	7.223672569430236
18726. it really looked as if a	change of the sort predicted by booker t washington had been going	on.	13.619140781485424
18727. but with the renewal of interference in 1954	the improvement was impaired.	10.142350094654658
18728. for over a hundred	years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them.	12.590022668715822
18729. it's infuriating this feeling that one is being picked on continually	constantly.	3.7874528475802363
18730. by what right of superior virtue southerners ask	do the people of the north do this?	12.60496419300634
18731.  the traditional strategy of the	south has been to expose the vices of the north to demonstrate that	the north possessed no superior virtue to show the world that	however	bad i may be you're not quite the people to say it.	6.641841682776107
18732. in the pre-civil war years the south argued that the slave was	not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north.	8.920442210989416
18733. at	the present time the counter-attack takes the line that there's no	more of the true spirit of integration in the north than	in the south.	5.697081186518027
18734. the line is a pretty good one.	16.035839902390393
18735. people talk about	the law of the land.	10.281983580341482
18736. the expression has become quite a cliche.	12.350894785491889
18737. but people can't be made to integrate socialize	by law.	6.554737604417683
18738. i was having lunch not	long ago with three distinguished	historians	and i asked them if they	could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed	with deliberate speed majestic instancy	by judicial fiat.	7.8664009720529515
18739. they didn't seem to be able to think of any.	8.356173454062588
18740. a virginia	judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years	might be a reasonable length of time for such a change.	10.13135415704331
18741. but i suspect	that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation-	the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he	said they make a desert and call it peace	.	6.327422823320864
18742. moreover the law of the land is not	irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been many times.	10.785786665187718
18743. mr	justice taney's dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the	north and soon became a dead letter.	5.06703858603574
18744. prohibition was the law of the	land but it was unpopular	in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially	and was repealed.	8.59748755437976
18745. the cliche loses	its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.	9.612725456202666
18746. the	declaration of independence says that governments derive their	just powers from the consent of the governed.	10.19862291092249
18747. the phrase consent	of the governed needs a hard look.	10.574878250525302
18748. how do we define it?	19.914289392385793
18749.  is the	consent of the governed a numerical majority?	10.670824614931982
18750.  calhoun dealt with	this question in his disquisition on government.	8.722689748325614
18751. to guard	against the tyranny of a numerical majority calhoun developed his	theory of concurrent majority which he said by giving to	each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the	action of government a negative on the others prevents all partial	or local legislation.	7.162482431591418
18752. who will say that our country is even now a	homogeneous community?	13.15437185329812
18753.  that regional peculiarities do not still exist?	8.989894151235553
18754. 	that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region?	9.172638307141519
18755. 	who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal	action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of the consent	of the governed?	7.324356887749251
18756.    circumstances alter cases.	13.977644141382852
18757. a friend	of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular	trouble out there that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell.	8.162556247985899
18758. he	seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular	trouble anywhere.	10.261241199196219
18759. i murmured something about a possible difference between	new mexico's history and mississippi's.	7.1436249843679835
18760. one can meet	with aloofness almost anywhere: the thank-heaven-we're-not-involved	viewpoint it doesn't affect us! southern liberals	- especially if they're rich- often exhibit	blithe insouciance.	3.5568638030553785
18761. the trouble here is that it's almost too easy	to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.	4.640664153427695
18762. you've already sent your daughter to miss x's select academy	for girls and your son to mr y's select academy for boys and	you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity.	5.317244574432759
18763. if there's	no suitable academy in your own neighborhood there's always new	england.	5.3933641058809325
18764. new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces	south as well as west.	11.106076455566892
18765. they may even enroll a colored student	or two for show though he usually turns out to be from thailand or	any place other than the american south.	7.895125591905192
18766. it would be interesting to	know how much integration there is in the famous fashionable colleges	and prep schools of new england.	13.233900229877431
18767. a recent newspaper report	said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one	thousand at yale; that is about one-half of one per cent which	looks pretty tokenish to me especially in an institution which	professes to be national.	5.534062971208178
18768. i must confess that i prefer	the liberal who is personally affected who is willing to send his own	children to a mixed school as proof of his faith.	9.129228871657098
18769. i leave out of account	the question of the best interests of the children the question	of what their best interests really are.	10.447065082252943
18770. i'm talking about the grand	manner of the liberal- north and south- who is not affected	personally.	3.9697117553470975
18771. if these people were denied a voice	what voices would be left?	9.00816340093738
18772.  who is involved	willy nilly?	17.50770973515279
18773.  well after everybody has followed the new england	pattern of segregating one's children into private schools	only the poor folks are left.	5.169016830983255
18774. and it is precisely in this poorer economic	class that one finds and has always found the most racial friction.	11.902878995741728
18775. a dear respected friend of mine who like myself grew up	in the south and has spent many years in new england said to me	not long ago: i can't forgive new england for rejecting	all complicity.	5.220055921051734
18776. being a teacher of american literature i remembered	whittier's massachusetts to virginia where he said:	but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone	and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown.	6.078883971739223
18777. there	is a legend	to the effect that the	mayflower	on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves.	7.980681332043305
18778. whether	historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value.	9.47029506927105
18779. complicity is an embarrassing word.	7.826435691790164
18780. it is something	which most of us try to get out from under.	20.335970195583624
18781. like the cowboy in stephen	crane's blue hotel we run around crying well i	didn't do anything did i?	5.18568504068511
18782.  robert penn warren puts it this	way in brother to dragons: the recognition of complicity	is the beginning of innocence where innocence i think means	about the same thing as redemption.	8.950619134420002
18783. a man must be able to say father	i have sinned	or there is no hope for him.	12.239420402658805
18784. lincoln understood	this better than most when he said in his second inaugural	that god gives to both north and south this terrible war as the	woe due to those by whom the offense came.	9.671647286798562
18785. he also spoke of the	wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited	toil.	6.810104131220419
18786. lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that	a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of	the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade.	9.674182585463821
18787. after	how many generations is such wealth	purified of taint?	6.5651799580930685
18788.  it is a question	which new englanders long ago put out of their minds.	15.896365374598734
18789. but didn't	they get off too easy?	7.733574060088619
18790.  the slaves never shared in their profits	while they did share in a very real sense in the profits of the	slave-owners: they were fed clothed doctored and so forth; they	were the beneficiaries of responsible paternalistic care.	7.4620576303380775
18791. emerson- platonist idealist doctrinaire- sounded a high transcendental	note in his boston hymn delivered in 1863 in the boston music	hall amidst thundering applause: pay ransom to the owner and	fill the bag to the brim.	4.126709172789816
18792. who is the owner?	22.239355403263374
18793.  the slave is owner	and ever was.	9.08293480100864
18794. pay him! it is the abstractionism the unrealism	of the pure idealist.	7.682822118099486
18795. it ignores the sordid financial aspects	conveniently too for his audience who could indulge in moral indignation	without visible or even conscious discomfort their money	from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic	.	7.0653061618900646
18796. like pilate they had washed their hands.	10.887291138012946
18797. but can one	really?	16.15385654722411
18798.  can god be mocked ever in the long run?	12.368425294626583
18799.    new	englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in	negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence	as jefferson explained in his autobiography:	the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa	was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia who	had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves and who on	the contrary still wished to continue it.	6.413241472409907
18800. our northern brethren also	i believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their	people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable	carriers of them to others.	7.133682737830853
18801. but that was a long	time ago.	15.514389750353164
18802. the new england conscience became desensitized.	16.59834917527297
18803. george	w cable writing in 1889 from paradise	road northampton agitated continuously	the southern question.	5.390901851326895
18804. it was nice to be able to isolate	it.	22.677146767063594
18805. new england as everyone knows has long been schoolmaster	to the nation.	8.458051587061032
18806. there one finds concentrated in a comparatively	small area the chief universities colleges and preparatory schools	of the united states.	10.768916502218067
18807. why should this be so?	12.427644901560223
18808.  it is true that new	england more than any other section was dedicated to education	from the start.	17.269060175472625
18809. but i think that something more than this is involved.	14.643869063287106
18810. how did it happen for example that the state university	that great symbol of american democracy failed to flourish in new england	as it did in other parts of the country?	11.691052701888466
18811.  isn't it a bit odd	that the three states of southern new england	have had state institutions of university	status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously	been a+m colleges?	4.535808188741108
18812.  was it supposed perchance that	a+m was quite sufficient for the	immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in	the post-civil war period the immigrants having been brought in from	southern europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor	shortage caused by migration to the west?	9.005806070425912
18813.  is it not ironical that	roger williams's state rhode island should have been the very	last of the forty-eight to establish a state university?	6.569475861954921
18814.  the state	universities of maine new hampshire and vermont are older and more	respectable; they had less immigration to contend with.	7.152789392809004
18815. a yale historian writing a few years ago in the yale review	said: we in new england have long since segregated our children.	8.18506544481027
18816. he was referring not only to the general college situation	but more especially to the preparatory schools.	13.064677763821912
18817. and what a galaxy of	those adorns that fair land! i don't propose to go into their history	but i have one or two surmises.	5.0273694932763044
18818. one is that they were established	or gained eminence under pressure provided by these same immigrants	from whom the old families wished to segregate their children.	10.37021174314246
18819. in the early days of a homogeneous population the public school was	quite satisfactory.	11.920753580585934
18820. among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature	more than half are practically unknown to readers of english.	11.078316549449184
18821. of these	there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than	verner von heidenstam the swedish poet and novelist who received	the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago.	5.7998040019914825
18822. equally a master of prose and verse he recreates the glory of sweden	in the past and continues it into the present.	9.373588342613655
18823. in the following sketch	we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as	possible speak for himself.	9.546199250854409
18824. heidenstam was born in 1859 of	a prosperous family.	12.024180529385196
18825. on his father's side he was of german descent	on his mother's he came of the old swedish nobility.	5.583095387737902
18826. the family	estate was situated near vadstena on lake va^ttern in south central	sweden.	7.338389137781752
18827. it is a lonely rather desolate region but full of legendary	and historic associations.	10.702618510207843
18828. as a boy in a local school he was shy	and solitary absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of	sweden's ancient glory.	10.26763751822651
18829. he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain	and to dress for the part.	10.00635694760716
18830. being somewhat delicate in health at the	age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe for which he at once	developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten	years abroad at first in italy then in greece egypt asia minor	and palestine.	8.85487126212215
18831. in one of his summers at home he married to the	great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth.	9.605004778457433
18832. deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of gerome	in paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found	that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction.	10.839088420450055
18833. he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem the	happy artists.	8.313564746874183
18834. i scanned the world through printed symbol	swart and through the beggar's rags i strove to see the inner man.	9.183310892430448
18835. i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart.	8.072902970420454
18836. in this final line we have the key to his nature.	16.809519387470775
18837. few writers	have better understood their deepest selves.	7.127857847937438
18838. heidenstam could never be	satisfied by surface.	11.423652856583939
18839. it may however be noted that his gift for color	and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris.	9.081633501902571
18840. the first result of heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was	a volume of poems pilgrimage and wander-years	published in 1888.	7.941524521235262
18841. it was a brilliant debut so much so	indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets as did byron's	childe harold.	7.917307725262153
18842. professor fredrik bo^o^k sweden's	foremost critic of the period acclaims it as follows: in	this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful plastic racy	vivid.	5.7589045493329305
18843. in a bold sometimes careless form there is nothing academic;	all is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp	and the imagination lively.	6.585474624598868
18844. the young poet-painter reproduces the french	life of the streets; he tells stories of the thousand and one	nights and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus.	6.586135024420772
18845. in the	care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the	old happy existence and for that reason he loves it.	7.3319387428733345
18846. and yet amid all	the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of	short poems thoughts in loneliness filled with brooding melancholy	and sombre longing.	7.047685786872196
18847. of the longer pieces of the volume	none is so memorable as nameless and immortal which at	once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language.	7.311897298657555
18848. it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of	neptune at paestum next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian	classic style now in existence.	9.635579844875101
18849. on the eve of his return to their	native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises	before them in its completed perfection.	9.256555572391996
18850. the supreme object of their	lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality.	10.906458706302907
18851. not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple	that is immortal.	9.885417414832196
18852. the man's true reputation is his work.	6.917928407085479
18853. the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as thoughts	in loneliness is as professor bo^o^k indicated in sharp contrast	with the others.	6.949648797457502
18854. it consists of fragmentary personal revelations	such as the spark: there is a spark dwells deep within	my soul.	9.445924251793398
18855. to get it out into the daylight's glow is my life's	aim both first and last the whole.	6.8522932614716385
18856. it slips away it burns and tortures	me.	15.284369454071685
18857. that little spark is all the wealth i know that little spark	is my life's misery.	7.774428304621156
18858. a dominant motive is the poet's longing	for his homeland and its boyhood associations: not men-folk but	the fields where i would stray the stones where as a child i used	to play.	6.266322136152602
18859. he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory	life he has been leading.	11.566819973369443
18860. what he really wants is to find a	sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself.	12.643610307702403
18861. this restless	individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all	the rest of his life in sweden.	9.002478168372907
18862. his cause was to commemorate the glory	of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.	8.910935746534
18863. he did not however find himself at once.	13.497946429818143
18864. his next major	work completed in 1892 was a long fantastic epic in prose entitled	hans alienus which professor bo^o^k describes as a monument	on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth.	6.431180736408911
18865. the hero who is	himself is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east	a sort of faustus type who to quote from professor bo^o^k again	even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from	his painful search after the meaning of life.	5.6392599882378285
18866. he is driven back by	his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of	tiveden.	10.878011920095755
18867. from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his	deeper self.	9.552348800524118
18868. by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession	of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions.	11.407801478147585
18869. he	did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were.	6.972012964976671
18870. like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little	patience with collective mediocrity.	10.085891979244277
18871. he saw sweden as a country of	smug and narrow provincialism indifferent to the heroic spirit of its	former glory.	7.095948327812407
18872. strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear	down the old structures and build anew from the ground up.	7.960272935715556
18873. heidenstam's	conception on the contrary was to revive the present by the memories	of the past.	5.827787134748383
18874. whether in prose or poetry all of heidenstam's	later work was concerned with sweden.	8.838687952360582
18875. with the first of a group	of historical novels the charles men published	in 1897-8 he achieved the masterpiece of his career.	8.103312535307248
18876. in scope	and power it can only be compared to tolstoy's war and peace.	9.745504718871267
18877. about one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better	coordinated more concise and more dramatic.	5.197805082321748
18878. though it centers around	the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 the true hero	is not finally the king himself.	9.986520140169194
18879. hence the title of the book referring	to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield	of poltava to quote from the novel the wreath he twined for	himself slipped down upon his people.	6.120277221982742
18880. the charles men	consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories	each depicting a special phase of the general subject.	10.056976558475618
18881. somewhat uneven	in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among	the finest of their kind in literature.	6.553433630895128
18882. they comprise a great variety	of scene and interest: grim episodes of war idyllic interludes superb	canvases of world-shaking events and delightfully humorous sketches	of odd characters.	5.953329010438817
18883. the general effect is tragic.	11.913118443611337
18884. almost nothing	is said of charles' spectacular victories the central theme being	the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune	and defeat.	7.291680485200391
18885. to carry out this exalted conception the	author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed	in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale.	7.355042969957854
18886. his	peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity.	9.834148896278636
18887. george	meredith has said that fervor is the core of style.	8.963553512790957
18888. of few authors	is this more true than of heidenstam.	12.895847379491638
18889. the charles men has a tremendous	range of characters of common folk even more than of major	figures.	7.894532703238908
18890. the career of charles 12 is obviously very similar to that	of napoleon.	12.851048608786925
18891. his ideal was alexander of macedon as napoleon's	was julius caesar.	5.489277593037578
18892. his purpose however was not to establish an	empire but to assert the principle of divine justice.	12.215868171040139
18893. each aspired	to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god.	8.796875546139505
18894. each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought	ruin on the country that worshipped him.	9.844089899629623
18895. each is still glorified	as a national hero.	9.193807132044645
18896. the first half of the charles men	ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 is more dramatically	coherent than the second.	14.035673488342285
18897. after the collapse of that desperate	and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a	time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.	7.261120458933179
18898. like napoleon he was the worst of losers.	12.749280179795896
18899. there are however some	wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning	the reactions of the swedes in adversity.	10.197485044428308
18900. then more than ever before	did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness.	10.624528389062059
18901. this comes	out in when the bells ring which describes the rallying of the	peasants in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the danes.	6.156112269516297
18902. in the king's ride charles breaks out of a long period	of petulance and inertia regains his old self escapes from turkey	and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years.	7.66373902235384
18903. he finds it in utter misery and desolation.	10.083231465637732
18904. all his people ask for	is no more war.	11.4418120341996
18905. but he plunges into yet another this time with norway	and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall being	only thirty-six years of age when he died.	7.5843126243169925
18906. he had become king at fifteen.	16.928187144975247
18907. then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular	feeling.	8.835061309666605
