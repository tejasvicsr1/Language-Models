SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. thus the transformation of adam	smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides	closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life.	10.626664617239829
2. driven	from the marketplace by the course of history our hero disguises	himself as a private detective.	11.489893803010617
3. the birth of the myth compensates	for the death of the ideal.	16.836097229511964
4. even on the fictional level however	the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully	resolved.	12.349935379706862
5. the individualism and public service of the private detective	both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct:	he enforces the law without being told to do so.	8.62373324678828
6. the private eye is therefore	a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society.	13.486586201410178
7. the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between	good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.	10.003220143079167
8. unfortunately this assumption does not always hold good.	14.194136851269583
9. as	capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon	force and violence for its survival the private detective is placed	in a serious dilemma.	8.798533941852485
10. if he is good he may not be legal; if he is	legal he may not be good.	18.706353864320263
11. it is the gradual unfolding and deepening	of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution	of the mystery story.	12.429610205591537
12. with the advent of sir arthur	conan doyle's sherlock holmes the development of the modern private	detective begins.	16.431872604798432
13. sherlock holmes is not merely an individualist;	he is very close to being a mental case.	12.269851177992978
14. a brief list of the great	detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide dr freud with	ample food for thought.	12.542304199933893
15. holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and	other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances	induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse an incredible	egotist a confirmed misogynist.	9.474719895986942
16. holmes rebels against the social	conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds.	10.254940765435954
17. his	eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom.	11.118618003375188
18. it was in order	to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became	a detective in the first place.	0.0
19. as he informs watson my life is	spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.	12.034255955572066
20. these little problems help me to do so.	15.69105466572749
21. holmes is a public servant	to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.	8.83153751019816
22. the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard	provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric	behavior.	11.525020720478054
23. although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland	yard holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality	of the police.	9.914816339602515
24. they for their part are convinced that holmes	is too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective.	14.708780229763613
25. why do the police find holmes unorthodox?	13.82198152098748
26.  on the face of	it it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official	police routine.	15.516817867554002
27. another more interesting explanation is hinted at by	watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have	made a magnificent criminal.	8.066200373475011
28. the great detective modestly agrees.	22.538740073640646
29. watson's	insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes	and his arch-opponent dr moriarty.	8.834168570742513
30. the two men resemble each other	closely in their cunning their egotism their relentlessness.	13.810636212939405
31. the	first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty	grappling together on the edge of a cliff.	11.329289177129665
32. they are presumed	to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace.	13.76045842468169
33. linked to holmes	even in death moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great	detective the image of what our hero might have become were he not a	public servant.	8.125222053035374
34. just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the	detective so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both.	12.02809575327848
35. in the modern english whodunnit this insinuation of	latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared.	11.589594004596323
36. hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey	have retained	holmes'	egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits.	9.723773562266802
37. poirot and	his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that	they are also extremely dull.	9.719819398675485
38. their dedication to the status quo has	been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism	of a sherlock holmes.	11.426658321681197
39. the latter's real descendents were unable	to take root in england; they fled from the victorian parlor	and made their way across the stormy atlantic.	8.58813561050702
40. in the american hardboiled	detective story of the '20s and '30s the spirit of the	mad genius from baker street lives on.	15.386259591792971
41. like holmes the	american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time.	10.303766801850994
42. but	unlike holmes he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt.	10.725826538405688
43. surrounded by crime and violence everywhere the hardboiled	private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed	isolation.	8.11858028311182
44. his alienation is far more acute than holmes'; he	is not an eccentric but rather an outcast.	11.315269183109283
45. with rex stout's nero	wolfe alienation is represented on a purely physical plane.	10.998619552217056
46. wolfe	refuses to ever leave his own house and spends most of his time drinking	beer and playing with orchids.	11.184515264157607
47. more profound and more disturbing	however is the moral isolation of raymond chandler's philip marlowe.	10.126803403066264
48. in a society where everything is for sale marlowe is the only	man who cannot be bought.	14.414533906206763
49. his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary	and difficult existence.	12.05306113109747
50. beaten bruised and exhausted he pursues	the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low	morals always alone always despised.	9.159936216703418
51. in the end he gets his man but	no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward.	12.559601406945568
52. a similar	tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers	of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery	stories dashiell hammett's the maltese falcon.	9.212240056081402
53. sam spade	joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled	statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last it turns	out to be a fake.	8.915143037943395
54. now the detective must save his own skin by informing	on the girl he loves who is also the real murderer.	12.0557556990861
55. for sam spade	neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover it is increasingly difficult	to distinguish between the two.	10.127701579209113
56. because the private eye	intends to save society in spite of himself he invariably finds himself	in trouble with the police.	13.085512424084955
57. the latter are either too stupid to	catch the killer or too corrupt to care.	11.019262863115445
58. in either case they do not	appreciate the private detective's zeal.	17.838332831278663
59. perry mason and hamilton	burger nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting	each other than they do in looking for the criminal.	8.620700661341417
60. frequently enough	the police are themselves in league with the killer; dashiell	hammett's	red harvest provides a classic example of this theme.	10.399901506915656
61. but even when the police are honest they do not trust the private	eye.	16.37515310291044
62. he is like phillip marlowe too alienated to be reliable.	17.802086057413756
63. finally	in the maltese falcon among others the clash between detective	and police is carried to its logical conclusion: sam spade	becomes the chief murder suspect.	7.556878632736834
64. in order to exonerate himself he	is compelled to find the real criminal who happens to be his girl friend.	14.843491050495684
65. what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes	now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of	turning into his opposite.	12.620226060409722
66. it is the growing contradiction	between individualism and public service in the mystery story which	creates this fatal dilemma.	17.68070771971906
67. by upholding his own personal code of behavior	the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society	whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption.	9.519083832104135
68. that society	responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo	a potential criminal.	13.366529245036569
69. if the detective insists upon retaining his	personal standards he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society.	10.707834214088361
70. he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel.	16.128209339970162
71. on the other hand if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession	he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism.	11.414224687177947
72. dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write	mystery	stories and turning to other pursuits.	10.11881746645696
73. his successors have adopted	the opposite alternative.	13.630455385097621
74. in order to save the mystery story they	have converted the private detective into an organization man.	17.076513075169736
75. the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by	mickey spillane's mike hammer.	14.255082638012235
76. at first glance this hero seems	to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.	13.442701580595445
77. for hammer nothing is forbidden.	18.089283221630154
78. he kills when he pleases	takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge jury	and executioner rolled into one.	10.395561669380484
79. it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in	an organization determine the type of network required because the	type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages	enumerated in table 1.	10.052507899833152
80. great stress is placed on the role that	the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness	of the network.	11.124447147029283
81. by monitoring we mean some system of control	over the types of information sent from the various centers.	8.95884813743039
82. as a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no	message is purely one of the four types question command statement	or exclamation.	14.645035685398177
83. for example suppose a man wearing a $200 watch driving	a 1959 rolls royce stops to ask a man on the sidewalk what	time is it?	9.607600146909316
84.  this sentence would have most of the characteristics	of a question but it has some of the characteristics of a statement	because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in	his own timepiece or the one attached to his car.	12.252183663991884
85. if the man on the	sidewalk is surprised at this question it has served as an exclamation.	11.605697823819012
86. also since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer	the question	has assumed some measurable properties of a command.	9.83566804009632
87. however for	convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified	according to table 1.	11.391724128334884
88. on this basis certain extreme kinds of networks	will be discussed for illustrative purposes.	14.062353033402466
89. some special types of organization	presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire	to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted	and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy	for future cooperative endeavors.	9.862969798145977
90. the party is usually in a room	small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another.	12.612142697066268
91. the information is furnished by each of the guests is sent by	oral broadcasting over the air waves and is received by the ears.	10.224087104094586
92. since	the air is a continuum the network of communication remains intact	regardless of the positions or motions of the points	in the net.	9.369072950020222
93. as shown in figure 1 there is a connection for communication	between every pair of points.	14.016903911143515
94. this and other qualifications make	the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication	system ever dreamed up.	12.285005881374289
95. all four types of message listed in table	1 are permitted although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding	the commands to a minimum while exclamations having complimentary	intonations are more than customarily encouraged.	8.020732391490792
96. the completeness	of the connections provide that for n people there are f	lines of communication between the pairs which can become a large number	for a party of fifty guests.	9.420211060413381
97. looking at the diagram we	see that f connection lines come in to each member.	10.373555417954535
98. thus the cocktail	party would appear to be the ideal system but there is one weakness.	22.46877008148263
99. in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group the	f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond	comprehension if n exceeds about six.	10.80880528192896
100. the crowd consequently	breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six with	a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.	10.053983740858714
101. for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else	and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers then	the open house system is advantageous because the honored guests	are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections	at the door.	7.680393507416722
102. we consider a rural	community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration	is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary	for family subsistence.	10.703728494176577
103. we assume for this illustration that the	size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings	is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication	is between nearest neighbors only as shown in figure 2.	10.696407044974293
104. information	beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- third- and fourth-hand	as a distortable rumor.	10.635267499930531
105. in figure 2 the points in the network are	designated by a letter accompanied by a number.	11.482582160749589
106. the numbers indicate	the number of nearest neighbors.	16.386222825564015
107. it will be noted that point f	has seven nearest neighbors h and e have six and p	has only one while the remaining points have intermediate numbers.	10.983492024550126
108. in any social system in which communications have an importance	comparable with that of production and other human factors a point	like f in figure 2 would be the dwelling	place for the community leader while e and h would	house the next most important citizens.	10.573544794721437
109. a point like p gets	information directly from n but all information beyond n	is indirectly relayed through n.	8.988146053999083
110. the dweller at p is	last to hear about a new cure the slowest to announce to his neighbors	his urgent distresses the one who goes the farthest to trade and the	one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or	getting people to join him in a cooperative effort.	9.14661436141702
111. since the hazards	of poor communication are so great p can be justified as a habitable	site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made	available by a waterfall for milling purposes a mine or a sugar maple	camp.	8.265816695034907
112. location theorists have given these matters much consideration.	12.3482207866056
113. the networks for military communications	are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be	changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the	addition of new machines of war.	9.832839889237803
114. they also furnish proof that in	modern war message sending must be monitored.	13.898701860496624
115. without monitoring a	military hookup becomes a noisy party.	11.605216425738629
116. the need for monitoring became	greater when radio was adopted for military signaling.	18.129945777744897
117. alexander the	great who used runners as message carriers did not have to worry about	having every officer in his command hear what he said and having	hundreds of them comment at once.	9.201235731754654
118. as time has passed and science has	progressed the speed of military vehicles has increased the range of	missiles has been extended the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles	has been adopted and the range and breadth of message sending	has increased.	10.133537574247173
119. next to the old problem of the slowness of decision	making network structure seems to be paramount and without monitoring	no network has value.	11.18710518677676
120. on the parade ground the net may be similar	to that shown in figure 3.	14.459250796844767
121. the monitoring is the highest and	most restrictive of any organization in existence.	10.61385277229228
122. no questions statements	or explanations are permitted- only commands.	14.92628101460717
123. commands go only	from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank.	10.892140101576791
124. the same command	is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to	corporal.	14.78878636778352
125. all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and	terminate with action of the men in the ranks.	13.054036105049532
126. even the officer in charge	be it a captain or a general is restrained	by monitoring.	13.130383702050258
127. this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the	hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility.	11.794325826435562
128. the commands are specified by the military regulations; are	few in number briefly worded all different in sound; and are combinable	into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be	desired on a parade ground.	8.827480710636815
129. this monitoring is necessary because on	a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitoring	a confused social event would develop.	8.84235919011082
130. with troops dispersed	on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that	a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines	of communication.	10.100848444054044
131. years ago this was true but with the replacement	of wires or runners by radio and radar these	restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard.	8.848414156139748
132. in contrast to cocktail parties military organizations even	in the field are more formal.	15.914160834864521
133. in the extreme and oversimplified example	suggested in figure 3 the organization is more easily understood	and more predictable in behavior.	10.863127006475501
134. a military organization has an objective	chosen by the higher command.	13.12566368285538
135. this objective is adhered to throughout	the duration of the action.	12.718093931360345
136. the connective system or network	is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective and it is therefore	not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated	unit has a different communication network than a factory a college	or a rural village.	9.989901336294901
137. the assumptions upon which the example	shown	in figure 3 is based are: one man can direct about six subordinates	if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not	need too much personal coaching indoctrinating etc.	9.093226367983398
138. a message	runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more	than about six consecutive times.	14.087949141882465
139. decisions of a general kind	are made by the central command.	11.062981495053428
140. and all action of a physical kind	pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower	rank.	13.364867658825048
141. these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the	top six directly under him six under each of these and so on until	there are six levels of personnel.	0.0
142. the number of people acting as one	body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of f 55987	men.	15.328502912926306
143. this organizational network would be of no avail if there	were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent.	9.311430574802475
144. of types	of message listed in table 1 commands and statements are the only	ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3.	11.01311060333863
145. a further	regulation is that commands always go down unaccompanied by statements	and statements always go up unaccompanied by commands.	8.810595225531808
146. questions	and particularly exclamations are usually channeled along informal	horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried	beyond the nearest neighbor.	9.051154372622117
147. it will readily be seen that	in this suggested network	greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than	is usually put into practice.	11.214719474796318
148. furthermore the network in figure	3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics	and the like are interlaced.	9.369072950020222
149. not discussed here are some	military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare where the	surveillance sending transmitting and receiving are all so inadequate	that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks.	8.099719486060966
150. such	problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much	like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall	grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they	could teach.	9.025476953187276
151. this is an unsolved	problem which probably has never been seriously investigated although	one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists	of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss for example	in precision machinery and mathematics or the finns in geochemistry.	8.85848357340128
152. we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have	not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine	our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes.	10.177331230510694
153. this problem	of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and	specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis.	8.791100132086969
154. since	the difficulty of drawing the net is great we will merely discuss	it.	11.224691946259922
155. first we realize that a pure specialist does not exist.	12.110651067881887
156. but	for practical purposes we have people who can be considered as such.	12.642087247073846
157. for example there are persons who are in physical science in the	field of mineralogy trained in crystallography who use only x-rays	applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction to clay	minerals only and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating	on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the	field of anthropology studying the lung capacity of seven andean	indians.	7.701187758979849
158. so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more	about less and less as he develops as contrasted to the generalist	who knows less and less about more and more.	10.945603271752214
159. american democratic thought pointed up the relation between the	protestant movement in this country and the development of a social	religion which he called the american democratic faith.	11.070986225653664
160. those familiar	with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the	democratic faith at around 1850.	10.68281135249726
161. and he describes it as a balanced polarity	between the notions of the free individual and what he called	the fundamental law.	10.771333362081924
162. i want to say more about gabriel's so-called	fundamental law.	20.06814843568875
163. but first i want to quote him on the relationship	that he found between religion and politics in this country and	what happened to it.	10.768968154851692
164. he points out that from the time of jackson on	through world war 1 evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence	in the social and political life of america.	12.925285618362528
165. he terms this	early enthusiasm romantic christianity and concludes that its	similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine	of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical	protestantism.	9.110406167049629
166. let me quote him even more fully for his	analysis is important to my theme.	14.438982416052422
167. he says: beside the	protestant philosophy of progress as expressed in radical or conservative	millenarianism should be placed the doctrine of the democratic	faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united	states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted	the beacon of democracy.	8.99554859158968
168. he specifies in the middle period	of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism	in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism.	16.389179345460608
169. but in	every period it has been humanism.	18.451413705355222
170. and let me add utopianism also.	18.698297498029078
171. some fourteen or fifteen years ago in an essay i called	the leader follows- where?	12.357433137802806
172.  i used his polarity to illustrate	what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call	progressivism.	11.849482651163308
173. it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the	balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law	in the common man.	12.688652036704719
174. that is to say gabriel's fundamental law had been	so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor	law any more.	16.466549949438626
175. it is a weakness of gabriel's analysis that he never	seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been	cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy.	11.20839425189115
176. and	with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel	called christian supernaturalism.	10.736481944814718
177. and the common man was developing	mythic power or charisma on his own.	13.901142389483454
178. during the decade	that followed the common man as that piece put it grew uncomfortable	as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow	only to learn from science to his shocked relief that after all there	was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow-	that there was a chemical formula for him and that too much couldn't	be expected of him.	10.661011437467115
179. the socialism implicit in the slogan	of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seems a	far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution	or of the jacksonian frontier.	8.729892858164698
180. what had happened to the common	man?	23.566361202526945
181.    french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence	in this country before the days of popularism.	10.037263334584896
182. the riotous onrush	of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general	secular drift to the religion of humanity however prepared	the way for a reception of the french revolution's socialistic offspring	of one sort of another.	10.378659451079832
183. the first of which to find important place	in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson.	13.148590120215168
184. moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s the	dislocations of the depression the common ethos of materialism everywhere	all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced	mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy	of the little people.	9.120777860147378
185. however it is important to trace the	philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the	common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence	of the latter on the former.	10.926551452395936
186. that john locke's philosophy of	the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration	of independence i believe we generally accept.	10.84949569647901
187. yet after	rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion	of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became	the idea source of the french revolution also.	9.075044788426853
188. the importance	of rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us however.	12.445450562798397
189. this	notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in	the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship.	9.025512235847062
190. and it	is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle in his remarkable long	essay the heresy of democracy and in a more general way by	voegelin in his new science of politics that this same rousseauan	idea descending through european democracy is the source of	marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.	9.33056309673833
191. this is important	to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves	in after world war 2 and our great democratic victory	that brought no peace.	11.677438759152873
192. the long road that had taken liberals in	this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of	man led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under	a socialist state.	9.642362316758227
193. and the ussr existed as the revolutionary	experiment in radical socialism the ultimate exemplar.	11.773028020681092
194. and by the	time the war ended liberal leadership in this country was spiritually	marxist.	16.37636803723313
195. we will recall that the still confident liberals of	the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in	san francisco to set up the legal framework finally and at last to	rationalize war- to rationalize want and fear- out of the world:	the united nations.	8.66479672218091
196. we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace	and rehabilitation.	16.790218457322926
197. then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle	of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral	war with our strongest ally.	8.539685232232568
198. during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly	backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal.	16.766027185184857
199. during	the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in	the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative	policy of containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced and enforceable	only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste	for but could not abandon: the atom bomb.	8.031723163142482
200. in 1952 it will be remembered	the gop without positive program campaigned on the	popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.	12.075622740754579
201. all of this i know is recent history familiar to you.	16.483287423730566
202. but	i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common	man to point up what happened to him under eisenhower's leadership.	10.776869011420148
203. a perceptive journalist sam lubell has phrased it in the	title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates.	10.329146678590092
204. he opens	his discourse however with a review of the eisenhower inaugural	festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents	all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age.	10.639121528756696
205. the	show was colorful indeed exuberant but the press for all its assiduity	could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.	8.05353195141302
206. lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue.	12.293196714863017
207. and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation: in essence	the drama of his presidency can be described	as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling- thus far	with but limited and precarious success- to give effective voice	and force to that conservatism.	7.7809369282948655
208. i will assume that we are	all aware of the continuing struggle with its limited and precarious	success toward conservatism.	13.345977208585841
209. it has moved on various levels it has	been clamorous and confused.	16.1320324454189
210. obviously there has been no agreement on	what american conservatism is or rather what it should be.	12.912572954069018
211. for it	was neglected not to say nascent when the struggle began.	13.359303253732154
212. i saw a	piece the other day assailing william buckley author of man and	god at yale and publisher of the national review as no conservative	at all but an old liberal.	10.677821190566803
213. i would agree with this view.	22.029682176672733
214. but	i'm not here to define conservatism.	13.915190642667962
215. what i am here to do	is to report on the gyrations of the struggle- a struggle that amounts	to self-redefinition- to see if we can predict its future course.	10.702232549527098
216. one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of	the last election i suppose is that we the majority were dissatisfied	with eisenhower conservatism.	17.197268048422142
217. though to be sure we gave kennedy	no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment.	10.706994262464496
218. this is however symptomatic of our national malaise.	23.029711963517855
219. but before i	try to diagnose it i would offer other evidence.	12.511186980231258
220. i will mention two	volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year.	14.898306677291863
221. the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise sponsored by life	magazine under the title of the national purpose.	12.037648280693157
222. the contributors	to this testament were all well-known: a former democratic	candidate for president a new deal poet the magazine's chief	editorial writer two newspaper columnists head of a national broadcasting	company a popular protestant evangelist etc.	9.030148867313864
223. what i want	to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals or modified liberals	with perhaps one exception.	15.803123592613636
224. i suppose we might classify billy	graham as an old liberal.	16.21272133212653
225. and i would further note that they all-	with one exception again- sang in one key or another the same song.	10.605692248663189
226. its refrain was: let us return to the individualistic democracy	of our forefathers for our salvation.	11.759718424507723
227. adlai stevenson	expressed some reservations about this return.	11.118618003375188
228. others invoked technology	and common sense.	18.425563280497766
229. only walter lippman envisioned the possibility	of our having outlived most of what we used to regard as the program	of our national purposes.	9.853628378223764
230. but the most notable thing about	the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth	of socialism was conspicuously absent.	13.827379443635978
231. the second specific	comment was the report of eisenhower's commission on national	goals titled goals for americans.	11.479433604693373
232. they perhaps gave the pitch	of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower	requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly	of columbia university because it was non-partisan.	10.579185815084557
233. the	commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the	unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to invoke the now	taboo symbolism of socialism.	7.485565382198017
234. and here again we hear the same refrain	mentioned above: the paramount goal of the united states	h set long ago h was to guard the rights of the individual h ensure	his development h enlarge his opportunity.	10.748698999227171
235. this group is secularist	and their program tends to be technological.	15.55616626831249
236. but it is	the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as	symptom of the common man's malaise.	15.003340335368183
237. and let me add murray's new	book as another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention	time magazine gave it when it came out recently.	9.903848824687177
238. father murray	goes back to the declaration of independence too though i may	add with considerably more historical perception.	12.807766186544182
239. i will reserve	discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy.	17.863723299234707
240. as symptomatic of the common man's malaise he is most significant:	a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth.	10.719882635173505
241. does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confused	state of the public mind?	11.143863583343759
242.    what is the common man's	complaint?	33.90591789918547
243.  let's take a panoramic look back over the course we	have come.	8.36537443497688
244. has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism	up until the turning back under eisenhower?	10.662117651209332
245.  and the basic character	of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic.	12.306328520829847
246. ralph	gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress.	13.119527703202275
247. but	there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.	10.530932308755343
248. does our society have a runaway uncontrollable growth of	technology which may end our civilization or a normal healthy growth?	10.765272748981467
249. 	here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers	by their rapidly accelerating growth determinable only when related	to the more normal rate of healthy growth.	8.309318115442148
250. should the accelerating	growth of technology then warn us?	14.451639446906915
251.  noting such evidence is the first	step; and almost the only cure is early detection and removal.	8.737700305869902
252. one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology	would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their	functioning is as healthy as before.	12.613041416383297
253. so an objective look at our	present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous	situation.	9.388560110563343
254. in any event whether society may have cancer or merely	a virus infection the disease we shall find is political	economical social and even medical.	11.99274405157438
255. have not our physical abilities	already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now	living?	12.902105953697184
256.  hence the prime issue as i see it is whether a democratic	or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind	or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible	with its own needs as a force of nature.	10.939596466466103
257. we are already committed	to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere	on earth not merely in the limited social-political-economical context	we are fond of today.	9.479227309370383
258. otherwise we go on endlessly trying to draw	the line color and other as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate.	10.15571246242766
259. we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to	contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is	to be extremely shortsighted if nothing else.	9.126134775207971
260. we must believe we have	the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything?	13.099378390369507
261. 	so in these pages the term technology is used to include any	and all means which could amplify project or augment man's control	over himself and over other men.	7.804659140729613
262. naturally this includes all communication	forms eg languages or any social political economic	or religious structures employed for such control.	9.984610574209123
263. properly mindful	of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world we must	employ these resources without war or violent revolution.	0.0
264. if	we were creating a wholly new society we could insist that our social	political economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than	hamper man; best growth.	9.148757032765333
265. but we cannot start off with a clean slate.	19.97500039273399
266. so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to	the effect of each on man's major needs.	11.910255894124841
267. asked which institution	most needs correction i would say the corporation as it exists in america	today.	10.32352990515417
268. at first glance this appears strange: of all people	was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new	way of life still inspiring undeveloped societies abroad?	10.32325105844697
269.  but	hear harrison e salisbury former moscow correspondent of the	new york times and author of to moscow- and beyond.	9.32635228082935
270. in a book review of the soviet cultural offensive he says	long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into	an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive	within soviet borders the sharp cutting-edge of american	culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes as when the enterprising	promoters of 'porgy and bess' overrode the state department	to carry the contemporary 'cultural warfare' behind the	enemy lines.	9.362034388804565
271. they were not diplomats or jazz musicians or even organizers	of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays but rugged capitalist	entrepreneurs like henry ford hugh cooper thomas campbell	the international harvester co and david w griffith.	8.467866750906403
272. their	kind created an american culture superior to any in the world an	industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did	almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal	treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or	program a series of consultations of interested agencies.	10.623921098376297
273. this favorable	image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still	there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda h	perhaps the public's present attitude	toward business stems from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur	no more exists in america.	10.768131216573002
274. in his stead is a milquetoast	version known as the corporation.	18.905356623181152
275. but even if we cannot see	the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america foreigners	can; and our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result.	10.543595658527142
276. no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts.	16.195282930425336
277. if we want respect	from ourselves or others we will have to earn it.	17.71932458041797
278. first let us	realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times now	the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership.	10.097950395557927
279. businesses	must develop as a result of the ideas energies and ambitions of an	individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind.	10.873836307158458
280. when we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure	by means of taxes and other legal statutes we adopted what i would	term pseudo-capitalism and so took a major step toward socialism.	9.99921678239643
281. the biggest loss of course was the individual's lessened desire	and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and	our economy.	10.4254369824733
282. socialism i grant has a definite place in our society.	11.33819267263277
283. but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to	a form that is not truly capitalistic.	11.242800289677797
284. some forms of capitalism do indeed	work- superb organizations a credit to any society.	11.675794299150496
285. but the pseudo-capitalism	which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics	and social life will not stand close scrutiny.	11.314608773941595
286. its pretense to operate	in the public interest is little more than a sham.	15.101733459608232
287. it serves	only its own stockholders and poorly at that.	15.164128120861005
288. as a creative enterprise	its abilities are primarily in swallowing creative enterprises	developed outside its own organization	.	13.458219426485217
289. as to benefits to employees it is notorious	for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.	10.229881986633483
290. the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism	vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged	within governmental bureaucracy.	12.924696593975314
291. but while the corporation has all	the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization	it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its	unluckily it	does not have the desirable aspect of socialism the motivation to operate	for the benefit of society as a whole.	8.318046916587575
292. so we are faced with a	vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever	manner they can without regard to the needs of society controlling	society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's	needs for survival.	11.115707908321598
293. the corporation has a limited specific	place in our society.	13.226625067609465
294. ideally speaking it should be allowed to operate	only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply	or services and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary	to the needs of society.	11.07692050743708
295. examples are in public utilities making	military aircraft and accessories or where the investment and risk	for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible	to achieve by any means other than the corporate form eg	constructing major airports or dams.	7.487209090274386
296. thus if corporations are not	to run away with us they must become quasi-governmental institutions	subject to public control and needs.	11.127504229249496
297. in all other areas private initiative	of the proprietorship type should be urged to produce the	desired goods and services.	10.596824577685155
298. avoiding runaway	technology can be done only by assuring a humane society; and for this	human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our	society rests.	10.447312856126917
299. such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can	offer corporations cannot.	11.96832811414073
300. it can project long-range goals for itself.	26.01085700804706
301. corporations react violently to short-range stimuli e g	quarterly and annual dividend reports.	9.070074471681158
302. proprietorships can establish	a unity and integrity of control; corporations being more amorphous	cannot.	10.635267499930531
303. proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity representing	a human personality and thus establish sincere relationships with	customers and community.	8.1523940120599
304. corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal	inhumane shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated	a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public.	9.860667025266434
305. the	proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate	structure with its board of directors and stockholders.	10.366156242098981
306. leadership is	lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop.	12.10285334462375
307. men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences	of the most varied complicated and trying type so that at maturation	they have developed the competence and willingness to accept	the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.	8.050311458253127
308. hence government	must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their	activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest.	11.722223839304318
309. proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations	e g the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth.	8.47444872869046
310. corporations should pay added taxes to be used for educational purposes	.	15.084343184941782
311. the right to leave legacies	should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated.	15.968820079465889
312. to perpetuate	wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no	role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to	the fore and is basically anti-democratic.	9.485627511408039
313. when the proprietor dies	the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired	by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it.	9.867507841569562
314. strikes	should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements	would have to be settled by government representatives acting as	controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would	now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors	must be completely interdependent as they are each a part of the	whole.	9.969190111062899
315. strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship if internally	motivated prevent a healthy relationship.	8.834168570742513
316. certainly external	forces	should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to	do so.	11.373954853670284
317. if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system how can	we expect to abolish it internationally?	11.736546563234015
318. 	these proposals would go far toward creating the economic	atmosphere favoring growth of the individual who in turn would help	us to cope with runaway technology.	11.056172763454672
319. individual human strength is	needed to pit against an inhuman condition.	9.669550099771405
320. the battle is not easy.	19.926638570224114
321. we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them	straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible	of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed	enlightened competent leaders.	9.61649068281106
322. persons developed in to-day's corporations	cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences	of my own in business and in activities outside.	9.057255130779156
323. in my own company in	effect a partnership although legally a corporation i have been able	to do many things for my employees which normal corporations	of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do.	9.2575858733153
324. also i	am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of	a partnership i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems	for myself and my fellow-employees.	9.957618292415653
325. any abilities i may have were	achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the	growth and control of my business coupled with raising my family.	7.8998707388535045
326. this	combined experience on a foundation of very average i assure you	intelligence and background has helped me do things many well-informed	people would bet heavily against.	8.777324869432913
327. perhaps a list of some of the practices	of my company will help here.	18.493418333289473
328. the company grew	out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties	neither having a formal education applicable to or experience in	manufacturing or selling our type of articles.	9.712682041130998
329. from an initial investment	of $1200 in 1943 it has grown with no additional capital investment	to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10000000	.	8.24721237802209
330. its growth	continues steadily on a par with past growth; and no limitation is	in evidence.	11.637352046821313
331. our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance	in just a few years time despite substantial well established competition.	10.969550900597739
332. during the last years of woodrow wilson's administration	a red scare developed in our country.	16.070082615624194
333. many americans reacted irrationally	to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of	ideas by force.	11.147205777376225
334. postmaster general burleson set about to protect the	american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through	the mails.	10.656914715509702
335. attorney general palmer made a series of raids that	sent more than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails in direct violation	of their constitutional rights.	8.20923525676712
336. then not many years later the	un-american activities committee under the leadership of martin	dies pilloried hundreds of decent patriotic citizens.	11.211507179538815
337. anyone who	tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy	was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction	of our government.	8.618144430153057
338. this hysteria reached its height under the	leadership of senator joseph mccarthy.	13.236737574390107
339. demagogues of this sort found	communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter	to stereotyped notions.	9.602324461666012
340. new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed	no matter how.	15.520343208428695
341. those who would suppress dangerous thoughts	credit ideas with high potency.	15.46946919878199
342. they give strict interpretation to	william james' statement that every idea that enters the mind	tends to express itself.	11.059381989900515
343. they seem to believe that a person will	act automatically as soon as he contacts something new.	13.735106922670537
344. hence the only	defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion unless it	gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.	13.787169326379994
345. despite this danger	however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are	our finest tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded	on a ledger page; they are the most valuable of commodities-	and the most salable for their demand far exceeds supply.	8.150467593189504
346. so all-important	are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and	happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent	new ideas of their own and those who borrow beg or steal from others.	9.824162671090155
347. seemingly with an unrestricted flow of ideas all will	be well and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff	away.	7.839519166543854
348. that however may also bring the police if the thinking	does not meet with social approval.	11.695880202418667
349. criminals as well as model	citizens exercise their minds.	12.981631851784549
350. merely having a mental image of some	sort is not the all-important consideration.	14.203922661164295
351. of course there	must be clarity: a single distinct impression is more valuable than	many fuzzy ones.	11.477702364956667
352. but clarity is not enough.	23.28422695159905
353. the writer took a class	of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st	joseph missouri.	11.083692544318808
354. an inmate a former university professor expounded	to us logically and clearly that someone was pilfering his thoughts.	10.518490512088729
355. he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities	that justice might be done.	12.711631895552589
356. despite the clarity of his presentation	his idea was not of einsteinian calibre.	14.952370014323837
357. true ideas	are important perhaps life's most precious treasures.	12.71711076079819
358. but have we	not gone overboard in stressing their significance?	15.939803339038377
359.  have we not actually	developed idea worship?	18.38213641124269
360.    ideas we must have and we seek	them everywhere.	15.455787536644833
361. we scour literature for them; here we find stored	the wisdom of great minds.	10.79494259960503
362. but are all these works worthy of consideration?	17.11360469437349
363. 	can they stand rigid scrutiny?	12.851133807717682
364.    shakespeare's	wit and wisdom his profound insight into human nature have stood the	test of centuries.	10.11881746645696
365. but was he infallible in all things?	15.873515172095546
366.  what of	his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice?	15.498761645415248
367. 	shakespeare	gives us a vivid picture of shylock but probably he never saw a	jew unless in some of his travels.	10.272696835618483
368. the jews had been banished from	england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 when	shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years.	10.377168343831244
369. if any had escaped	expulsion by hiding they certainly would not frequent the market-place.	12.139520618074535
370. shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays	but borrowed them from old stories ballads and plays wove them	together and then breathed into them his spark of life.	8.528302420652933
371. rather than	from a first-hand study of jewish people his delineation of shylock	stems from a collection of italian stories il pecorone published	in 1558	although written almost two centuries earlier.	8.43523367941858
372. he could	learn at second hand from books but could not thus capture the real	jewish spirit.	12.457900152694792
373. harris j griston in shaking the dust from	shakespeare writes: there is not a word spoken by shylock	which one would expect from a real jew.	9.167855228358352
374. he took the	story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone.	14.429556708282828
375. the jew	was the safest victim.	16.994033841028205
376. no jew was on hand to boycott his financially	struggling theater.	16.41872765574073
377. it would have been unwise policy for instance	to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman.	15.617449857764434
378. just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars or even	of tikopia and no senatorial investigation will result.	11.203376571318083
379. who cares	about them!   shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an	aberrant individual.	10.268682470081565
380. he sets him forth as being typical of the group.	15.596842900833998
381. he tells of his jewish heart- not a shylockian heart;	but a jewish heart.	10.829607627746384
382. this would make anyone crafty and cruel capable	of fiendish revenge.	16.654801947892352
383. there is no justification for such misrepresentation.	32.29365278834892
384. if living jews were unavailable for study the bible	was at hand.	14.389953369344052
385. reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist	that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews.	8.696021657583344
386. are we better off for having shakespeare's idea of shylock?	16.429362310901816
387. 	studying the merchant of venice in high school and college	has given many young people their notions about jews.	9.562207595990513
388. does this help	the non-jew to understand this group?	18.624554345273843
389.    thomas de torquemada	inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition put many persons	to death.	9.976540319721277
390. his name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty.	14.786935048686583
391. would	we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's roman	catholics by saying he had a catholic heart?	8.619144959405775
392.  let his bones and	his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is	out of place in our times.	10.533283760131958
393. shakespeare's shylock too is of dubious	value in the modern world.	10.471849600293623
394. ideas in and of themselves are	not necessarily the greatest good.	11.33819267263277
395. a successful businessman recently	prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all	economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where	they and their theories might rot together.	8.346357804604096
396. will his words come	to be treasured and quoted through the years?	12.811082601272657
397.    frequently we	are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted	and in the end only the good ones will survive.	9.4342002582181
398. but is that not	like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids	and powders from an array of bottles and then after stirring expecting	a new wonder drug inevitably to result?	10.059068431278002
399.    what of the efficiency	of this natural instrument of free discussion?	12.027864760275495
400.  is there some	magic in it that assures results?	21.08145704785199
401.    when peter b kyne	informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive	dislike for the japanese did the heated debates of the californians	settle the truth or falsity of the proposition?	8.43816215575093
402.    the	leopard's spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902	and in this he announced an unchangeable law.	10.659748484641154
403. if a child had	a single drop of negro blood he would revert to the ancestral line which	except as slaves under a superior race had not made one step of	progress in 3000 years.	8.81914262051124
404. that doctrine has been accepted by many but	has it produced good results?	12.949566671261206
405.    in the same vein a certain	short-story plot has been overworked.	17.858607539670427
406. the son and heir of a prominent	family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of	her finger nails.	13.632940482893407
407. in time she presents her aristocratic husband with	a coal-black child.	13.781255853785437
408. is the world better for having this idea thrust upon	it?	17.685001130451365
409.  will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity?	12.045319261353159
410. 	for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists	the biologists the historians the psychologists and the sociologists.	10.096675271787365
411. long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap	heap.	10.252686605070428
412. false ideas surfeit another sector of our life.	12.919117098695102
413. for	several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship.	11.059189214877165
414. the stepmother almost without exception has been presented	as a cruel ogress.	12.957840546200554
415. children conditioned by this mistaken notion	have feared stepmothers while adults by their antagonistic attitudes	have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one.	8.276100876688245
416. debate	is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild	a happier one.	12.000769768292406
417. research on the other hand has shown many stepmothers	to be eminently successful some far better than the real mothers.	11.268705627618152
418. helen deutsch informed us	that in all cultures the term 'stepmother'	automatically evokes deprecatory implications a conclusion accepted	by many.	9.559225930701576
419. will mere debate on that proposition even though it be	free and untrammeled remove the dross and leave a residue of refined	gold?	9.549718747212925
420.  that is questionable to say the least.	21.942782191180346
421. research into several	cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one.	10.912778093346255
422. most	assuredly ideas are invaluable.	16.6462465444584
423. but ideas just for the sake of having	them are not enough.	14.799406533276631
424. in the 1930's cures for the depression literally	flooded washington.	19.10610348648294
425. for a time the president received hundreds	of them every day most of them worthless.	16.332534712281316
426. ideas need to be	tested and not merely by argument and debate.	11.9493378842528
427. when some question arises	in the medical field concerning cancer for instance we do not	turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign.	9.54364998475027
428. we have	recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory.	15.328138173534445
429. the	merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the	forensic platform or in newspaper editorials but in the laboratory	and by tests in the field on thousands of children.	8.482749541275552
430. our presidential	campaigns provide much debate and argument.	14.509194571811173
431. but is the result	new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence	solve our domestic and international problems?	12.177837336811372
432.  man we are	told is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from	bad.	13.209397228804459
433. but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value	from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely particularly since	such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes in themselves	declarations of intellectual bankruptcy.	8.86674869991014
434. we are reminded however	that freedom of thought and discussion the unfettered exchange	of ideas is basic under our form of government.	11.758344371777676
435. assuredly in	our political campaigns there is freedom to think to examine any and	all issues and to speak without restraint.	8.104114449891131
436. but	have the results been heartening?	15.068811854765874
437.  may we state with confidence that	in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security?	8.496699580743604
438. 	we must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate	have produced beneficial results.	13.220325267436278
439. in truth we can say that this broke	the power of senator joseph mccarthy who was finally exposed	in full light to the american people.	10.74797641082219
440. if he had been liquidated	in some way he would have become a martyr a rallying point for people	who shared his ideas.	15.947809122349225
441. debate in the political arena can be productive	of good.	10.28906378590409
442. but it is a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce	negative results but not much that is positive.	18.203293984765796
443. debate rid us of	mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive.	11.256500001974366
444. it did something	to clear the ground but it erected no striking new structure; it	did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new.	11.013052281004235
445. in the field of the natural sciences scientifically verified data are	quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good	results.	12.356527315778035
446. in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of	tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage.	18.761116390792083
447. by no means would we discourage the production of ideas:	they provide raw materials with which to work; they provide stimulations	that lead to further production.	10.16979934372916
448. we would establish no censorship.	27.67942407812947
449. the president's personality would have opened that office to him.	11.572314230763848
450. and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the	land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make	it a successorship by inheritance.	16.2715960333518
451. it is testimony to the deep respect	in which mr eisenhower was held by members of all parties that	the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were	not explicitly to be broached.	9.61765823300218
452. these began to be apparent in a	press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting	specialists might clarify the president's condition for the	nation.	10.675439900107015
453. and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate	the ethics of the medical profession his article in the atlantic	monthly accomplished a good deal more.	11.074267557023026
454. it forced us to fix the responsibility	for the position in which all medical commentators had been	placed.	13.278955802267507
455. the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded	us that in the historical perspective the president's decision will	finally clarify itself as a moral rather than a medical problem.	9.124970853684234
456. because	the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president	rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us	the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems	under political pressure.	8.77521642155812
457. for the president had dealt with the	matter humbly in what he conceived as the democratic way.	12.320731630814656
458. but the	problem is one which gives us the measure of a man rather than a group	of men whether a group of doctors a group of party members assembled	at a dinner to give their opinion or the masses of the voters.	11.364162319113
459. any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in	the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive	it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the	chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and	president in a situation which should never have arisen.	8.857209456440104
460. it was a	response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition	which resulted in attempts at prediction.	14.502008228301495
461. in no other situation	would a group of doctors struggling competently to improve the life	expectancy of a man beloved by the world be subjected to such merciless	and persistent questioning and before they were prepared to demonstrate	the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind	the problems it faces.	8.108589532836197
462. and though we can look back now and see their	errors we can look back also to the ultimate error.	10.98820926794175
463. it recurred	in the press conferences: the president's remarks about his running	developed a singular tone one which we find in few statements	made by public individuals on such a matter.	9.02901550784969
464. the press conference became	a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than	his convictions.	11.470061218625109
465. he commented- thoughtfully a reporter told us-	that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up.	10.15071367228567
466. he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst	period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any	renewed question about his running: as in the battle of the bulge	he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers.	11.35484613810077
467. yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such	a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed	with battles to be fought regardless of the consequences.	9.27329975465072
468. in this	case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears.	18.240511881953836
469. the	presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications	of the death of any incumbent.	10.994546996895716
470. it is of the utmost importance to the	people of america and of the world how their governing president ends	up during the four years of his term.	17.41458088349082
471. only when that term is	ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom	and the courage to discount the dangers of his death.	9.900316298726928
472. ironically enough	in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury.	11.461595236710806
473. at	the national and international level then what is the highest kind	of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political	immorality.	8.899187487635391
474. and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the	moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us.	12.169525606947051
475. for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr eisenhower's	original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting.	10.189721087989247
476. neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive	sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation	betraying its sense that something significant has transpired	was in evidence.	9.11918354088194
477. nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than	the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine	the issue which also carried the second announcement of the	candidacy.	7.801852578047582
478. the double editorial on two aspects of the u s	spirit was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles	great as well as small reflecting popular approval of this questionable	attitude toward the highest office in the land.	10.776252603914239
479. the moral	creed and the will to risk live happily together if we	do not examine where the line is to be drawn.	9.529880863924301
480. i may possibly be a	greater risk than is the normal person of my age the president had	said on february 29th of the election year ignoring the fact that	no one of his age had ever lived out another term.	9.497772093408505
481. my doctors assure	me that this increased percentage of risk is not great.	9.788699130504304
482. but by	the time the risk was doubled events had dismissed from his mind both	increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering	carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza.	9.413838475716577
483. only infrequently	did the situation color his thinking.	13.884859222195189
484. ironically no president	we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the	possibility to which his own words in the press conference held at	the beginning of august testified: that unable as he was himself	to say his running was best for the country unconsciously he had placed	his party before his nation.	9.489622885487504
485. so it is that we relive his opening	statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy	of the present.	15.24042922617643
486. no consideration of risk urges itself upon him	now: for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not	properly focussed.	12.705523470052716
487. yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than	some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him he feels what	he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest	he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters.	7.171167027304237
488. moving	as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of	him he adopts a position that is morally indefensible.	9.421411858468362
489. he ascribes	to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter- the assurance	that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer	than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do-	has brought him.	10.530221235761346
490. what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the	laws of human probability whether or not it is later confirmed has	become by september of the election year a firm conviction.	11.395830344948594
491. as	a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place the	statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion	which gives rise to such convictions.	8.454254762350164
492. but it is also the climax	to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history.	21.753770264930008
493. in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could	not rest with his doctors eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening	of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration	in the years to follow.	8.22190847805486
494. in any other man this reassurance to the electorate	would have caused us a profound moral shock.	13.16823058680082
495. about this man we	had to think twice.	13.276062151403123
496. we knew that it was as reassurance the ironic	fruit of a deeply moral nature.	13.914274492555274
497. but the fact remains that even the unconscious	acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected	must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major	decisions and thus for imposing his will on the people.	11.31135233812159
498. and in the	context of drifting personal utterances we have examined there was	occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions.	12.46434254412458
499. when the possibility	that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision	seemed	to disconcert his questioners mr eisenhower was known to	make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going	to talk about the matter any more.	9.378560017504407
500. thinking had stopped; it was not	to be resumed.	12.3482207866056
501. the portrait that had developed fragmentarily	but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking	is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits when it does not	forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence.	10.172307535721474
502. this does not mean that the decision to run for office should	inevitably have been revoked.	19.28855535873663
503. instead it means that the thinking in	which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the	decision as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative	attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered	might have done.	9.809652530823293
504. drifting through a third illness apparently	without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency	other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower revealed the singularly	static quality of his thinking.	9.07011250796162
505. despite three warnings no	sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation and	thus his responsibilities from wilson's.	8.795361677128112
506. by contrast the	energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes	upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure	of the man.	10.221258512137952
507. only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed	considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention	to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality	in the major decision are effectively to be checked.	8.3149716293498
508. in the	incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus	the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to articulate	the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant with what	is sometimes astounding rapidity.	10.362376168285593
509. like lincoln he can distinguish	his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable	decision exacts of him.	8.984282195859107
510. like roosevelt he can distinguish an	attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans	from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him.	9.556731439859504
511. he chooses to subordinate one to the other sometimes reluctantly	accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed.	11.964969493240575
512. the very	nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the	valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader.	9.602164633469624
513. the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact	and the facility with language which can render them into validity	in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the	moral intuition into moral leadership.	8.11220137918219
514. the making of distinctions	like the perception of the great distinctions made is an inordinately	difficult business.	13.763562992808644
515. lincoln's slow progress towards the several	marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such and loosely	interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision.	7.817158228673359
516. but	because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other	by means of the capacities with which words endow it we do not unwisely	examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which	decisions hang.	10.893659622670251
517. only recently and perhaps because a television debate	can so effectively dramatize president kennedy's extraordinary	mastery of detail have the abilities on which the capacity for making	distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of	politics.	8.660128064450143
518. in his recent evaluation of kennedy's potentialities for	leadership walter lippmann has cited the precision of his mind	his immense command of factual detail and his instinct for	the crucial point as impressive in the extreme; and it is surely	clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the	individual's command of language interacts with the other two.	12.430634352316725
519. for this change is not a change from one positive position to another	but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation.	10.696040605344075
520. the	liberal-conservative	division we might observe in passing is not of itself	directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle	between ruling groups.	9.986294753703476
521. rather it is rooted in a difference of response	to the threat of social disintegration.	11.710067595183027
522. the division is not between	those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change.	18.106984098438915
523. rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways	of thought with regard to man's life in society.	10.63002910703058
524. these ways are	absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for	man's redemption from chaos.	11.134059678696923
525. the civilizational crisis the	third type of change raises the question what are we to do?	10.416295925107828
526. 	on the most primitive level.	15.068811854765874
527. for the answer cannot be derived from any	socially cohesive element in the disrupting community.	12.147208215066925
528. there is no	socially existential answer to the question.	33.05863159956165
529. for the truth formerly experienced	by the community no longer has existential status in the community	nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians.	9.178460109121565
530. in this phase of change no idea has social acceptance and so none	has ontological status in the community.	12.445736881556911
531. an interregnum ensues in which	not men but ideas compete for existence.	10.396143870453175
532. if we examine the	three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure	we find an additional profound difference between the third and the	first two one that accounts for the notable difference between the	responses they evoke.	11.868531022100054
533. the first two types of change occur within the	inward and immanent structure of the society.	12.881605881912188
534. the first involves a simple	shift of interests in the society.	15.69409224410976
535. the second involves something	deeper but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for	the community not in the truth on which the community rests.	10.165143273644492
536. thus in	both types attention is focused on the community itself and its phenomenological	life.	11.70989417906224
537. the third type however wrenches attention from	the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the	ground of being on which the community depends for its existence.	9.66000672005429
538. voegelin	has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable healthy	community.	21.603517803547653
539. there the community faced with the need to formulate policy	on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to its problem	in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced.	10.839226378738584
540. this	however cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth	is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard and consequently	cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent.	9.391978398011739
541. it has	lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances.	12.09254085852554
542. relativism	and equality are its characteristic diseases.	13.915190642667962
543. precisely at the moment	when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out	from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure	itself.	9.12942865127599
544. for paradigmatic history breaks rather than unfolds	precisely when the movement is from order to disorder and not from	one order to a new order.	10.862348369863795
545. the liberal-conservative split to define	it further derives from a basic difference concerning the existential	status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads	to its identification.	8.735625895254493
546. when disruptive change has penetrated	to the third level of social order the process of disruption rapidly	reaches a point of no return.	12.14916133153301
547. indeed it is probable that this point	is reached the moment the third level of change begins.	11.263445697305286
548. at that point	we reach the closed historical situation: the situation in	which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante.	13.14987715190725
549. at that	point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously fate	or destiny or providence and feel themselves	caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society.	10.315137564846895
550. the reasons	for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of	such a change.	12.420830230345356
551. of all forms of being society or community	has the greatest element of determinability.	13.86321993672811
552. its ontological status is	itself most tenuous because apart from individual men who are its matter	tradition the form of society exists only as a shared	perception of truth.	10.925751496230939
553. the ontological status of society thus is constituted	by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status of society's	members.	10.242653103537407
554. the content of that psychological status determines	ultimately the content of civilization.	16.491883786679594
555. those social civilizational	factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease	to exist.	13.451540380306147
556. civilization itself- tradition- falls out of existence	when the human spirit itself becomes confused.	10.358652090748608
557. civilization is what	man has made of himself.	11.118618003375188
558. its massive contours are rooted in the simple	need of man since he is always incomplete to complete himself.	10.22595053868721
559. it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse.	26.354458687007977
560. he needs existential	completion he needs that is to move in the direction of completion.	18.539357493544667
561. and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception	of the truth about himself.	13.091003074793447
562. he must consequently exist as a	self-perceived substantive developing agent or he does not exist as	man.	15.702699617428756
563. thus it is no mystical intuition but an analyzable conception	to say that man and his tradition can fall out of existence.	9.099798230431686
564. this	happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance	in himself of a nature that in maritain's words is perceived as	a locus of intelligible necessities.	9.65356691670736
565. an existentialist is a man	who perceives himself only as esse as existence without substance.	9.431209500815976
566. thus human perception and human volition is the immanent	cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches	the civilizational level.	9.572108569029782
567. thus with regard to the loss of tradition	in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works	itself out as a disruption of the individual soul a change in which man	continues as an objective ontological existent but no longer as a	man.	9.489223758650581
568. further change is a form of motion it occurs as the act	of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached	the terminus of the change.	11.478737145829568
569. with regard to the change we are examining	the question is at what point does the change become irreversible?	11.469195013804834
570. 	a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in	the process.	10.957705180640192
571. change involves the displacement of form.	14.90447970041415
572. this means that	the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive	to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring	the existent form in being.	10.57467653918704
573. if the existent form is to be retained new	factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation.	12.588256445858661
574. in	the case of social decay form is displaced simply by the process of	dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process.	9.287687644678446
575. now in the	mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence	of the ontological weakness of the fading form.	12.183987981815463
576. and when we consider	the tenuous hold tradition has on existence any weakening of that	hold constitutes a crisis of existence.	12.913762161249597
577. the retention of a tradition	confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new	spiritual forces into the situation.	10.087497005037322
578. however the crisis occurs precisely	as a weakening of spiritual forces.	15.326863132413063
579. it would seem therefore that	in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself.	19.835933218964403
580. the emergence	of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory	of disorder.	13.066327256517155
581. and it would seem that history is a witness to this	truth.	18.22524620299027
582. as a further characterization of the liberal conservative	split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for	escaping inevitabilities in history.	13.094858918664169
583. these differences in turn derive	from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character	of change.	9.495459372186279
584. anxiety and deep insecurity	are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition.	10.358652090748608
585. to experience them it is not necessary for a people to be actively	aware of what is happening to it.	13.957276992084624
586. the process of erosion need only	undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding	within the individual while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation	of processes occurs.	11.619817753953429
587. within the individual the reaction has been	called various names all however pointing to the same basic experience.	10.820311517218242
588. weil identifies it as being rootless guardini as being	placeless riesman as being lonely.	10.358652090748608
589. others call it alienation	and mean by that no simple economic experience	but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation.	8.88622581898661
590. within institutions	there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution	of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one	of persuasion.	11.15931207300495
591. we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon the manipulation	of the masses by propaganda the mobilization of effort and	resources.	10.087828044273675
592. within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed	responses to the experience of civilizational crisis two basic organizations	of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism.	11.792759678530023
593. these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent	in the crisis.	12.029409820358078
594. both are predictably destined to fail.	19.843528935441054
595. the	response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing.	9.521882735323508
596. its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through	the repression of disruptive forces.	10.516426501676232
597. to this end political authority	is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers.	11.687871687744227
598. the implicit	assumption of this response is that history is reversible.	13.569310574206803
599. seemingly	order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by	adventitious accretions.	12.104967975023735
600. the problem is to remove the accretions and	thereby uncover the order that was always there.	15.94318274057682
601. such a response of	course misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence.	11.147534518668849
602. moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed	to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of	order once the activation of change has reached visible proportions.	9.600224904081502
603. the most reaction can achieve is stasis and a stasis that can be maintained	only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts	itself.	9.462447362308476
604. despite the hopelessness of the response it is explicable	in terms of the crisis of tradition itself.	14.349422188024823
605. since a civilizational	crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling	class reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves	to be among the ruling class.	8.713275851573387
606. their great error is to mingle the responses	typical of each of the three types of change.	13.200462446559204
607. since civilizational	change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze it seldom is	given adequate attention.	10.832214432906673
608. and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted	as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status.	12.812119524546368
609. the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its	realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational.	13.011695145045195
610. but this truth is distorted by its extreme application: the assumption	of the separate existence of tradition.	13.747849361541393
611. the reactionary misses	the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of	psychological-intellectual	relations.	16.126133178918323
612. reactionary theories for this reason	usually assume some form of organismic theory.	12.601367513989699
613. in its defensive	formulations the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of	the independent existence of the community.	11.99672928392683
614. in its dynamic form it	visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force-	the race for instance which unfolds in history.	11.530376003202782
615. in both cases the	individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality.	16.050908751715927
616. when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual	defense the characteristics of that defense are explicable only	in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction.	11.400491827653253
617. reaction is	rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole.	9.669550099771405
618. it is a total situation	that is defended: the good old days.	25.907882955779115
619. there is no selectivity;	even the questionable features of the past are defended.	24.52956696995469
620. the point	is that the reactionary for whatever motive perceives himself to	have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself	something which consequently he was not able to accept or reject	on the basis of subjective preference.	9.543690835006105
621. the reactionary is confused about	the existential status of a decaying tradition but he does perceive	the unity tradition had when it was healthy.	9.196692880353178
622. all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic	insight in a literary work.	19.351456349493116
623. is the oedipus complex the clinical	syndrome material for a tragedy?	13.916760472870717
624.  if we remove ourselves for a moment	from our time and our infatuation with mental disease isn't there	something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile	neurosis?	10.164544190055087
625.  i am not making a clinical judgment here for such	personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's	consulting room but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies	than tragedy in life.	8.606904075063344
626. a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood	and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat	his earliest failure in love only makes us a little weary of man;	his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial.	9.62017806585764
627. now we can argue that	the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible	unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward but this	externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between	a story and a clinical case history.	9.319042101628975
628. we can also argue that the	three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives	of an internal conflict within one man dostoevsky a conflict	having to	do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman.	9.520272765813406
629. but	a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within	his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic	quarterly.	8.701199743142457
630. it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of	oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex.	16.71712771340973
631. whatever	the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who is drawn	to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of	humanity and its archaic crime and the incest that is unknowing renews	the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the	secret.	6.824828964873485
632. but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose	his own childhood is only pathetic and for renouncing the mystery	in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies.	9.598399176544799
633. i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus	complex is a blind alley for a storyteller.	11.601168999968012
634. the best gifts of the novelist	will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises	the novelist may have in store for him.	10.544724327170558
635. incest is still a durable	theme but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways	to surprise the emotions and there is no better way to do this than	that of concealment and symbolic representation.	12.74703939112169
636. and the best way to	conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out	to write an incest story.	15.048640981443661
637. which brings to mind another lawrence story	and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal	theme.	11.181456414694594
638. the rocking horse winner is also a story about	a boy's love for his mother.	12.681641678167264
639. if i now risk some comparisons with	sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two	works or judging their merits; i am only singling out differences	in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects.	9.19017488816383
640. the rocking horse	winner is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the	reader- but we do not know why.	12.703347892537371
641. it is the story of the hopeless love	of a little boy for his cold and vain mother.	16.7914089684962
642. there are ghostly scenes	in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the	climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse.	12.29381250034236
643. the	child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make	secret gifts of his money to his mother.	7.811867791937725
644. the story ends in the child's	illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to	ride his horse to win for his mother.	12.011831693128917
645. the child dies with his mourning	mother at his bedside.	14.001135454550269
646. i had read the story many times without	asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did.	12.188812722439529
647. but on one	occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was	my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story.	9.786997635652432
648. it was of course a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to	himself and replacing the father who could not give her the things she	wanted- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like- but if it were	only this the story would be banal.	11.45165471418652
649. why does the story affect us?	15.952050508642948
650.  how	does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader?	12.04824024138872
651.  the	rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that	prophesies the tragedy.	9.411428944112574
652. the rocking i realized is the single element	in the story that carries the erotic message the unspoken and	unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy	and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit.	9.195692843384133
653. the	rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent	silent and making it present; it conceals and yet is suggestive;	a perfect symbol.	8.330360244553352
654. and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol	we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy.	13.496254121584023
655. for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden	love doomed by its nature.	10.231737216887648
656. we are also struck by the fact	that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend while	the incestuous love of the man paul morel sometimes repels.	11.189884979452588
657. it's	easy to see why.	14.19641732877796
658. this love belongs to childhood; we accord it	its place there and in lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent	fantasy of a child in fact the form in which oedipal love is expressed	in childhood.	0.0
659. and when the child dies in lawrence's story	in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make	his mother rich the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such	a death does not enter into our thoughts at all.	8.632390127456253
660. we have so completely	entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the	plausible and the necessary conclusion.	12.90289743193962
661. i am sure that none	of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to	describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood.	12.429197351919038
662. it is most probable that	freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing	of this story.	16.42889741325053
663. he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told	and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged.	11.89835381965564
664. he would not	have cared why it emerged he only wanted to capture a memory to play	with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the	story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy.	9.370611740371132
665. in	our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis	has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from	this marriage.	8.7752676981046
666. ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring	forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled.	9.41376326541715
667. the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge; he	has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological	insights.	11.390987133473793
668. he borrows the insights of psychology to improve	his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision	that should be a novelist's own.	10.927587856149215
669. he has been seduced by the marvels	of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces	of character.	11.848121703241244
670. if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear	to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is	because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that	we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior that the ego	is still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of	personality must be discerned through the ego.	8.770577806168266
671. the novelist who has	been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that	since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the	same faces.	8.095436280654093
672. i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus	complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature.	12.579454866720571
673. but a	writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern	dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the	incest myth the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness.	10.579036320758545
674. moral dread is seen as the other face of desire and here psychoanalysis	delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem	of great complexity.	8.700181695682264
675. there is probably some significance	in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered	in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth.	13.402170362948219
676. the ancient types	are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their	destinies but the myth fails before the modern truth; the oracle	speaks false and the dream speaks true.	9.294914972676366
677. in both the farmer's tale	in ralph ellison's invisible man and in thomas mann's the	holy sinner the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting	the wish as motive; the heroic act is the casting off of pretense.	8.332281315701803
678. thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951.	13.399906883201648
679. it was conceived	as a leave-taking a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths	of the west bevor die nacht sinkt eine lange nacht vielleicht	und ein tiefes vergessen.	10.17925602208184
680. he chose a medieval legend of	incest gregorius vom stein and freely borrowed and parodied other	myths of the west mixing themes language peoples and times in a master	myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves as in his	previous treatment of joseph.	9.425241734613603
681. but the holy sinner is	not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment.	11.42787674614598
682. mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center	of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as	the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated	joke he liked to tell.	9.058302736879158
683. and when he retold the legend of gregorius	he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak	contemporary thoughts in archaic language; while they move through	the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through	not-knowing they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other	and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the	twentieth-century manner.	7.625636134165381
684. grigorss is the child of an incestuous	union between a royal brother and sister the twins sibylla and	wiligis.	10.392461855791495
685. he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast	adrift soon after birth.	14.96774598733468
686. the infant is discovered by a fisherman who	brings him home to rear him.	12.010194183656237
687. an ivory tablet in the infant's cask	recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child	by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village.	8.384448649902836
688. grigorss at	seventeen learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his	origins.	10.710215524939649
689. his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own	country at a time when sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies	of one of her rejected suitors.	9.09154912744501
690. grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle	delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had	fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him.	8.868590831500464
691. sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory	tablet concealed by her husband and the identities of mother and son	are revealed.	8.185301807500297
692. grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen	years.	10.957705180640192
693. at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive	the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock.	11.928839656823333
694. grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope.	10.957705180640192
695. in	the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience	with the great pope and to give her confession.	8.776347839673564
696. mother and son recognize	each other and in mann's version of this legend make a remarkable	confession of guilt to each other the confession of unconscious	motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the	time they had first set eyes on each other.	8.496678298955377
697. in recollection he has said: natural or man-made objects kept coming	into my head but i would suppress them sternly.	10.22158279159855
698. moreover	he organized the movement of his forms within his rigorously shaped space	into highly complex equilibriums; and used gradations of color	value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors.	9.552891784410386
699. the worthy	mondrian seeing these pictures said in a tone of kindly reproof:	but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition!	helion did not realize it at the time but it was true.	10.443262310573198
700. his	monumental abstraction made up of smooth metallic non-objects	acting upon each other with great tension won helion much	acclaim during the 'thirties.	9.969213054681358
701. the play of novel lighting effects also	entered into these compositions whose controlled power and varied	activity made them well worth meditating.	9.190705605346782
702. as helion's work	showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature the pure	abstractionists expressed some disapproval; but leger arp lipchitz	and alexander calder at the time gave him their blessing.	11.566828976010392
703. his	canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be figures	in space or blue figure or pink figure; and	they had heads and feet.	7.921237043437305
704. exhibited in shows in london in	1935 and in new york the following year the new more elaborated	abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional	dramas of great intellectual coherence.	9.119645214758153
705. at this period	the thirty-year old helion was ranked as one of the mature leaders	of the modern movement according to herbert read and in the	direct line of descent from cezanne seurat gris and leger.	9.84900580432608
706. in	america meyer schapiro observed that unlike the mondrian school	helion sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the	framework of abstract art.	8.860944413918231
707. it is notable that at this time	he was writing with admiration of cimabue's and poussin's way	of filling space.	11.930157865150644
708. abstract art was still the right path for him; but	he	held instead of continuing as an art of reduction it must grow	must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins	as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian.	10.219755157584524
709. later	helion wrote of this phase: for years i built for myself	a subtle instrument of relationships- colors and forms without a name.	8.012715441890187
710. i played on it my secret songs unexplained passionate and peaceful.	13.977553257793254
711. but his own work was evolving further.	17.822137599866455
712. the extreme limitations	he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly	arid and cold.	11.367296473428217
713. he was engaged in constant experiments that	searched for new directions.	15.823820498722922
714. where would it all lead?	19.2245848694212
715.  he himself	did not know as he said in 1935.	14.192444330436182
716. but he was afraid of the future-	he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration a functional	art of some kind.	12.52891744320267
717. during the 1920's the abstractionists	the german bauhaus group of industrial designers and the new	architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia or welfare	state in which their neat and logical constructions might find their	proper place.	8.144729725976715
718. but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem	to helion to be determined to escape from the real world or simply	to rebel against it the ordered abstractions which he and his	associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of improving	things.	10.456150759303947
719. we were possessed by visions of a new civilization	to come very pure and elevated he has said in fact some ideal	form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918.	9.636988708405442
720. instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic	depression the rise of fascist dictators in europe the wasting	civil war in spain.	11.813236666114767
721. very much the political man helion felt himself	deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france	and all europe whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky.	8.95288349247569
722. in 1936 he decided to migrate to america.	19.577093454513435
723. the rooseveltian america	was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute	the last best hope for civilization.	9.353917450386227
724. helion also hoped that	america's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be	accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works.	9.730278311764925
725. i arrived	in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there	more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions.	11.623488905645031
726. in new york he was well received by what was then only	a small brave band of non-figurative artists including alexander calder	george k l morris de kooning holty and a few others.	12.432761586076928
727. after a year in a studio on sheridan square having married an	american girl who was a native of virginia helion moved to a village	in the blue ridge mountains where he produced some of the most	imposing of his abstract canvases.	9.202928193366178
728. the darkening world scene	at the time of the munich pact continued to trouble his mind even in	his remote virginia studio.	12.407145516226326
729. fear possessed me and the certainty	of war he has related.	11.624782530604882
730. i truly smelled blood death heaps of	corpses everywhere.	16.739551443331074
731. in haste he labored to finish some last abstract	paintings: a three-panel frieze with a flying figure and a fallen	figure; a double-figure which went to the chicago art	institute and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts;	and in early 1939 a fallen figure of very ominous character	which concluded his abstract phase.	7.816507143109458
732. i knew i was carrying	on with abstraction to its very end- for me he said of the two	years' output in virginia.	11.86405192009562
733. with those paintings of big constructions	crashing down he felt he could stop.	10.998619552217056
734. they were in effect his last	testament to non-objective art.	19.93414474687307
735. he had taken out first papers	for american citizenship; but after war came to europe he decided	to return to france arriving there in january 1940.	9.448571018451105
736. i hated	the war he said but thought i ought to go because i was perhaps	one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it.	12.653471143773983
737. in june 1940 sergeant helion with a company of reserve troops waiting	to go into battle was sketching the hills south of the loire	river when the war suddenly rolled in upon him.	9.090741842249743
738. its first apparition	was a long gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons or pushing	prams.	10.516426501676232
739. his company then carried out a confused retreating movement	until it was surrounded by the germans a few days before france capitulated.	9.508896042057964
740. after a sort of death march during four days without food	helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp	at an estate farm in east germany.	10.377546302136379
741. a year later they were removed to	a stalag in the harbor of stettin.	14.3636368027225
742. at the time of his capture helion	had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth's in	new york.	17.171014241703038
743. when he was stripped deloused and numbered by his guards	his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners'	goods to be confiscated.	10.108672531479332
744. it was then i knew that they were	making war against man the individual within!- who questioned	things when given orders.	14.03521005725349
745. at stettin the university-educated	artist who had studied german was chosen to serve as interpreter	and clerk in the office of the stalag commander.	11.90190113517412
746. in secret he also	acted as a member of the prisoners' central committee which plotted	sabotage planned a few escapes and maintained a hidden control over	the wretched french slave-laborers.	12.428173694670106
747. in the stalag helion	came to know and love his comrades most of them plain folk who in	their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each	other.	9.516873672712112
748. how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground	committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped	to escape.	15.873582083878357
749. in the prison camp's black market civilian clothes were	quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him; during long	weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed.	9.069972709595639
750. every morning	contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories.	11.727822646441703
751. one evening while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard	among the prisoners remaining there a simulated melee was staged-	just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from	work.	7.7527755691764675
752. as helion wrote afterward:   their sentry followed	h four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me.	11.05739119427178
753. marquet	held my briefcase; finot held a wallet with my money and papers;	moineau and david held nothing but their fingers h they felt	rough and kind and warm.	7.491016806109364
754. at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground.	24.734425477052994
755. duclos ran toward desprez with fists raised.	11.118618003375188
756. the guards all	rushed up to intervene h   shedding his prison cloak helion	shot through the gates now clad in civilian garments and with the	passport of a flemish worker.	9.28613009907557
757. riding trains hitching hikes on trucks	across germany slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of	secret guides he eventually reached vichy france and by the winter	of 1943 was back in virginia.	8.46947620954903
758. he wrote:   to escape from	a prison camp required a very special state of mind; not only loathing	of captivity but a faith a hope that is even stronger.	8.673600200919685
759. i left	behind me brave men whom captivity had robbed of all hope.	11.39502876035506
760. they too	loved their families longed for their villages: yet lacked the faith	that drove one to dare h the fearful chance of escape.	10.070431970951558
761. it was a time of revelations for him.	27.939830987354394
762. even the most rational of men	under great stress may be transported by a new faith and behave like	mystics.	13.392408914618
763. helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice	of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 stettin as to	his own fierce	will and love of life.	8.681689291258845
764. after that he declared to return to	freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore	it.	11.669574411819653
765. in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from	life his guards his companions in misery.	11.713346667053546
766. now all his desires centered	on rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful	world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence.	9.125868111066753
767. and he added: during the many months in prison camp all	abstract images vanished from my mind.	10.750799557710204
768. before leaving for america	he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to	him his new resolutions.	10.815399813654365
769. arp protested: but it is impossible!	everything in the way of representation has already been done by the	old masters.	12.71890112460255
770. helion however clung to the belief that in escaping	from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction.	11.72739803403208
771. while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording	his prison experiences and escape entitled: they shall not have	me h published originally in english by dutton	+ co of new york in 1943 the book was received by the press	as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic	accounts of world war 2 from the french side.	0.0
772. it was very widely	read too; and the author who seemed the embodiment of france's	rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors was much complimented	for his daring military action.	11.619505848077122
773. but when he showed his new figurative	pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp they paid him	no compliments and drew long faces.	9.803235113315028
774. between 1944 and 1947 helion	had a series of one-man shows- at the paul rosenberg gallery	in new york and in paris- of his new realistic pictures.	11.048026138029497
775. they reincarnated	the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since	the 1920's.	10.98253957699321
776. these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace	objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking	about as the things they missed most hence associated with the sense	of lost freedom: the cafe at the corner the newspaper kiosk the girls	in doorways and windows along the street the golden-crusted french	bread they lacked the cigarettes denied them.	8.91449453341488
777. one of the pictures	was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette;	others were of men doffing their hats to each other carrying	umbrellas with pomp reading newspapers or simply showing loaves of	bread spread out.	10.798279002546279
778. important as was mr o'donnell's essay his thesis is	so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has.	9.159936216703418
779. he and also mr cowley and mr warren have fallen to the temptation	which besets many of us to read into our authors- nathaniel	hawthorne for example and herman melville- protests against	modernism material progress and science which are genuine protests of	our own but may not have been theirs.	8.633885691306586
780. faulkner's total works today	and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr cowley	made his comment or in 1939 when mr o'donnell wrote his	essay reveal no such simple attitude toward the south.	8.649140806869656
781. if he is a	traditionalist he is an eclectic traditionalist.	20.84815796347185
782. if he condemns the	recent or the present he condemns the past with no less force.	14.207112426088159
783. if he	sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen he sees also- and he	shows- the blind and the mean and he sees the compson family disintegrating	from within.	8.459405173172051
784. if the barn-burner's family produces a flem	snopes who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic	crassness the compson family produces a jason compson 4.	11.255736170072643
785. faulkner	is a most untraditional traditionalist.	12.851133807717682
786. others writing on	faulkner have found the phrase traditional moralist either inadequate	or misleading.	11.909078541408611
787. among them are frederick j hoffman william	van o'connor and mrs olga vickery.	12.540492328654198
788. they have indicated	the direction but they have not been explicit enough i believe in	pointing out faulkner's independence his questioning if not indeed	challenging the southern tradition.	12.153885612188937
789. faulkner's is not the mind	of the apologist which mr o'donnell implies that it is.	9.59112685554823
790. he is	not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body	of social cultural or literary traditions than he was within the traditions-	or possibly the regulations- governing his tenure in the	post office at oxford mississippi thirty-five years ago.	8.953845090245515
791. that	is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that	he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in	his books.	8.560177264164002
792. it is to say rather i believe that he has brought to bear	on the history the traditions and the lore of his region a critical	skeptical mind- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate	experimenter in literary form and technique.	12.820422423801734
793. he has employed from	his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed	southern.	12.031475454603587
794. the fact that he has cast over those materials the light	of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern i rather	think for the south has been no more solid than other regions except	in the political and related areas where patronage and force and	intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity.	11.80895883433475
795. some of us might	be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action	and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical	are particularly southern traits.	10.162977316714983
796. there is no necessity i suppose	to assert that mr faulkner is southern.	22.13637695185652
797. it would not be	easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his	family.	17.367478201560075
798. and after all he has lived comfortably at both oxford mississippi	and charlottesville virginia.	14.599563684635566
799. the young william faulkner	in new orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist hamilton	basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner and there is no	evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so.	8.563287258399386
800. besides showing no inclination apparently to absent himself from his	native region even for short periods and in addition writing a shelf	of books set in the region he has handled in those books an astonishingly	complete list of matters which have been important in the south	during the past hundred years.	9.072452968782798
801. it is more difficult with faulkner	than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is	the source of his knowledge.	14.338104196373132
802. his own testimony is that he has read very	little in the history of the south implying that what he knows of	that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around	him primarily from his own unassisted observation.	12.184057632011994
803. his denials of extensive	reading notwithstanding it is no doubt safe to assume that he	has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has	gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived	in the south or have written about the south.	8.485414666289675
804. to believe otherwise	would be unrealistic.	20.316658383077467
805. but in looking at faulkner against	his background in mississippi and the south it is important not to	lose the broader perspective.	13.263539781266996
806. his earliest work reflected heavy influences	from english and continental writers.	12.517407265378024
807. evidence is plentiful that	early	and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers	who deal in extravagant horror to the symbolists writing at the end	of the preceding century and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness	novelists henry james and james joyce among them.	7.6527640598260716
808. his repeated	experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence	of mind and an originality of approach but it also shows him	touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him.	9.307809338405729
809. my intention therefore is not to say that faulkner's awareness	has been confined within the borders of the south but rather that	he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook	is southern.	9.388700322896524
810. the ingredients of faulkner's novels and	stories are by no means new with him and most of the problems he takes	up have had the attention of authors before him.	15.097638234091747
811. a useful comment	on his relation to his region may be made i think by noting briefly	how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated	from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining	faithful to the essential character of the region.	7.588672080845083
812. the planter	aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton	kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait	of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated	the most persistent tradition of southern literature.	9.551276264969097
813. the thoroughgoing	idealization of the planter society did not come however	until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend	a way of life which had been destroyed.	10.766568201338114
814. as they looked with nostalgia	to a society which had been swept away they were probably no more	than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed.	10.651204499788054
815. their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the	south even while memories of the war were still sharp.	9.043494076704487
816. the tradition	reached its apex perhaps in the works of thomas nelson page toward	the end of the century and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934	in the best-selling novel so red the rose by stark young.	12.184488135647893
817. although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition	he did not have stark young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize	the planter society.	9.432204891602842
818. the myth of the southern plantation	has had only a tangential relation with actuality as francis	pendleton gaines showed forty years ago and i suspect it has had a	far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed.	10.60288342561383
819. faulkner has found it useful but he has employed it with his	habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook.	9.845942834363331
820. without saying or	seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families	faulkner's chief concern is social criticism we can say nevertheless	that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the	planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil	war.	8.994238311694115
821. it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional	pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment	in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen	glasgow who was the only important novelist before him to challenge	the conventional picture of planter society.	9.622913581935327
822. faulkner's low-class	characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels	dealing with plantation life.	10.358652090748608
823. they have an ancestry extending back	however at least to 1728 when william byrd described the lubberlanders	he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina.	10.87165815776839
824. the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the	realistic humorous writing which originated in the south and the	southwest in the three decades before the civil war.	10.736275290547193
825. these narratives	of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers	as a rule and later found their way between book covers though	rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes	of horace mr addison mr pope and sir walter scott.	7.278872160057525
826. there is evidence to suggest in fact that many authors of the humorous	sketches were prompted to write them- or to make them as indelicate	as they are- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements	which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south.	12.415625704900188
827. william	gilmore simms sturdy realist that he was pleaded for a natural	robustness such as he	found in his favorites the great elizabethans	to vivify the pale writings being produced around him.	7.743550703070935
828. simms admired	the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods but he had himself social	affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully.	10.433698154769708
829. augustus	baldwin longstreet a preacher and a college and university president	in four southern states published the earliest of these backwoods	sketches and in the character ransy sniffle in the accounts of	sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat and in the shockingly	unliterary speech of his characters he set an example followed	by many after him.	7.421930747762768
830. others who wrote of low characters and low	life included thomas bangs thorpe creator of the big bear of arkansas	and tom owen the bee-hunter; johnson jones hooper whose	character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in	both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the	sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will; and george	washington harris whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood	perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain	than any other character in literature.	8.218745688065384
831. it would be profitable i believe	to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner's works	the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything	to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with	a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our	time to faulkner's time.	8.6519335470365
832. such a comparison reminds us that in employing	low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality	in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent.	10.33302596488572
833. such characters with their low existence and often low morality	produce humorous effects in his novels and tales as they did in	the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris but it need not be	added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than	they had in the earlier writers; nor is there need to add that among	them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful	of his characters.	7.859092041911255
834. one of the early humorists already mentioned	thomas bangs thorpe can be used to illustrate another point	where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier	literary treatment of those materials.	14.528676825775833
835. thorpe came to louisiana from	the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting	of romantic adventure and idealized beauty.	9.720910701527535
836. but thorpe saw also	the hardships of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier	settlements and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions.	10.781154151808089
837. as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and	feelings he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips	and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble arkansas	where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece	of frontier humor the big bear of arkansas in which	earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods	tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the	mysteries of nature.	8.148801414635306
838. some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made	up of members of the british association for the advancement of	science that man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are now	in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice	age.	10.282745044528713
839. as a humanist dr huxley interests himself in the possibilities	of human development and one thing we can say about this	suggestion which comes from a leading zoologist is that so far as he	is concerned the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon	the idea of future human evolution.	8.819577019403038
840. this text from dr huxley	is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission	of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment	of psychic powers in human beings.	11.875532373786843
841. there may be a case of this sort	but it is not one we wish to argue here.	18.010408348397167
842. even if people do in a	not far distant future begin to read one another's minds there will	still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind	is especially worth reading- worth more that is than what you can	read in good books.	9.380435517062025
843. even if men eventually find themselves able to	look through walls and around corners one may question whether this	will help them to live better lives.	9.461804672512063
844. there would be side-conclusions	to be drawn of course; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing	to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts	of biologists and organic evolutionists; but the basic puzzles	of existence would still be puzzling and we should still have to work	out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article.	10.372308996033029
845. all we want from dr huxley's statement is the feeling that this	is an open world in the view of the best scientific opinion with	practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next and	no important confinements with respect to what may be possible.	10.375458405734753
846. it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human	beings arise from the fact that man is not one but many.	17.36903978166056
847. each man	that is is both one and many.	12.141006964183084
848. he is a dreamer of the good society with	a plan to put into effect and he is an individual craftsman with	something to make for himself and the people of his time.	15.432078547501128
849. he is a parent	with a child to nurture here and now and he is an educator who worries	about the children half way round the world.	11.617320431694937
850. he is a utopian with	a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the	circumstances of today.	15.384704026908588
851. he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and	he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself.	12.699678478708153
852. he is a craig's wife who agonizes	about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful	genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the	local university have come to call.	12.56899629194557
853. he is the stern guardian of the status	quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age and he	is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic	apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed.	10.609445525231731
854. what will be	the final symmetry of the good society?	15.838330233706856
855.  for what do the utopians	labor?	18.089283221630154
856.  here on a desk is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts	of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions.	15.227482228621364
857. the pamphlets are about law the corporation forms of government the	idea of freedom the defense of liberty the various lethargies which	overtake our major institutions the gap between traditional social	ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their	realization.	7.708696617364773
858. the thing that is notable in all these discussions is	the lack of ideological ardor.	15.584737040554824
859. there is another kind of ardor a quiet	sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life but no	angry utopian contentions.	12.302046881483125
860. actually you could wish for some passion	now and then but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos	of current history which partisan social passions have wrought	you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized	calm.	10.864286413333936
861. you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving	quality of maturity.	11.984939663121036
862. there is essential pleasantness in reading the	writing of men who are not angry who can contend without quarreling.	18.82138637781448
863. this is the good kind of sophistication and with all our problems	and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states	during recent years.	12.751451919109183
864. a characteristic expression of such concern	and inquiry is found in joseph p lyford's introduction to the	agreeable autocracies a recent paperback study of the institutions	of modern democratic society.	10.56206916353871
865. mr lyford gives voice to a temper	that represents we think an achieved plateau of reflective thinking.	9.209486886273746
866. after casting about for a way of describing this spirit we decided	that it would be better to use mr lyford's introduction as	an illustration.	12.199696282190114
867. he begins:   at one time it seemed as if	the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example	of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations.	9.073294780237223
868. as	things turned out however we have not profited greatly from the lesson:	instead of persistently following a national program of our own	we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed	to be at the moment.	9.083423652774396
869. such activity may or may not have irritated	the kremlin but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural	defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the	free world.	10.234686030898159
870. the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another	bad habit our tendency to rate the goodness or badness	of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate	about ourselves.	10.549985041917255
871. since the slogans have little application to	reality and are sanctimonious to boot the applause is faint even in areas	of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection	for free government.	8.567686394307866
872. shocked at the response to our proclamations	we grow more defensive and worse we lose our sense of humor and proportion.	11.04027719297576
873. mr nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by	our department of state and an american president observes sourly	that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more	capitalistic.	9.39962668503266
874. one thing you can say about mr lyford is	that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american.	14.342991133573655
875. those	who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination.	11.672239317009712
876. only the strong	look squarely at weakness.	21.252153568900752
877. the maturity in this point of view lies	in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being	clearly understood.	9.923870435782753
878. mr lyford continues:   even if the	self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it	would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society.	10.711179043756891
879. we	would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries.	10.057988591011652
880. the	picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american	life.	13.134257968474927
881. the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what	we practice or tolerate is great and it does not escape the notice	of others.	9.48488101319057
882. if our sincerity is granted and it is granted the discrepancy	can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe	hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding	gained by earnest self-examination.	13.350031974507013
883. what is more the legends have become	so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism	smells of low treason and men who practice it are defeatists and	unpatriotic scoundrels.	9.42139065211706
884. h although we continue to pay our	conversational devotions to free private enterprise individual	initiative the democratic way government of the people	competition of the marketplace etc we live rather comfortably	in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in	large areas bureaucracy is corroding representative government technology	is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make	decisions and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically	into the ground.	8.700729746365928
885. the interesting thing about mr	lyford's approach and the approach of the contributors to the	agreeable autocracies to the situation	of american civilization is that it is concerned with comprehending	the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect	on american life.	9.766290105541161
886. in an ideological argument the participants tend	to thump the table.	16.639086177834077
887. they are determined to prove something.	27.45870445310963
888. the	new spirit so well illustrated by mr lyford's work is wholly	free of this anxiety.	10.204371885396943
889. the problem is rather to find out what is actually	happening and this is especially difficult for the reason that we	are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present sometimes	by the very agencies- our educational system our mass media our	statesmen- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding	of ourselves.	11.524722143214541
890. the introduction continues:   we experience	a vague uneasiness about events a suspicion that our political	and economic institutions like the genie in the bottle have escaped	confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them.	10.241997532461724
891. we feel	uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television	set but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and	what they are doing to us we can hardly learn to control them.	8.138924878439626
892. it does	not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles	on the national purpose.	15.565475223745233
893. the agreeable autocracies	is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect	and determine the character of the free society today.	11.66525071422639
894. the men who	speculate on these institutions have for the most part come to at least	one common conclusion: that many of the great enterprises and associations	around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic	in nature and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate	the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern	world.	12.103102659301179
895. these institutions which mr lyford names agreeable	autocracies- where did they come from?	10.100086864412003
896.  of one thing we	can be sure: they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists	of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles	and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the free	society.	10.645021782914112
897. no doubt there are historians who can explain to a	great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth	century.	11.078218343349032
898. going back over this ground and analyzing the composition	of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken	by the center for the study of democratic institutions in	santa barbara.	12.52015030025825
899. but however we come finally to explain and account	for the present the truth we are trying to expose right now is that	the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find	it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host	of all their enterprises.	7.838894742689819
900. the host is the flowing life of the human race.	18.926003981872626
901. this life has its own currents and rhythms its own multiple cycles	and adaptations.	10.795142792559794
902. on occasion it produces extraordinary novelties.	20.051102976987014
903. should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory	for the advent of television atomic energy and ibm machines?	9.504486635221678
904. 	how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the	field?	11.33819267263277
905.  they tell us sir that we are free because we have in one	hand a ballot and in the other a stock certificate.	13.231063447258167
906. with these we	shape our destiny and own private property and that sir makes ours	the best of all possible societies.	12.747603711644329
907. the reality of the situation however	is described by mr lyford:   many of us may even	be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient	civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts.	10.673243094692772
908. thus the member	of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business	agents who may proceed without interference or recall; the stockholder	delivers his proxy; and the citizen narrows his political participation	to the mere act of voting- if he votes at all.	8.73776155659174
909. copernicus did not question it ptolemy could not.	10.530932308755343
910. given the conceptual	context within which ancient thought thrived how could anyone have	questioned this principle?	11.486185329148212
911.  the reasons for this are partly observational	partly philosophical and reinforced by other aesthetic and	cultural factors.	0.0
912. the obvious	natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the	heavens.	12.445450562798397
913. not only did constellations like draco cepheus and cassiopeia	spin circles around the pole but stars which were not circumpolar	rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night.	9.269624121870203
914. nor did	a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their	nocturnal flights.	14.041362749953795
915. the conclusion- the distances of the constellations	did not vary and their paths were circular.	9.923610580026844
916. moreover the sun's	path over earth described a segment of a great circle; this was	clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after	noon.	10.262519220020877
917. as early as the 6th century bc the earth	was seen to be spherical.	14.154408351131273
918. ships disappear hull-first over the horizon;	approaching shore their masts appeared first.	10.957705180640192
919. earth being at	the center of the universe would have the same shape as the latter;	so eg did aristotle argue although this may not be an observational	reason in favor of circularity.	11.316093563972716
920. the discoid shapes of	sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things.	13.44956000297554
921. in light of all this one would require special reasons for	saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular.	10.005214732009838
922. why for example should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation	of the heavens to be elliptical?	11.817214040116216
923.  or oviform?	25.961705577610427
924.  or angular?	30.44183203064129
925. 	there were no reasons for such suppositions then.	10.530932308755343
926. this conjoined	with the considerations above made the circular motions of heavenly	bodies appear an almost directly observed fact.	10.940520249915352
927. additional philosophical	considerations advanced notably by aristotle supported further	the circularity principle.	10.28439750487086
928. by distinguishing superlunary	and sublunary existence and reinforcing this with	the four-element physics of empedocles aristotle came to speak of	the stars as perfect bodies which moved in only a perfect way viz	in a perfect circle.	8.910140641450697
929. now what is perfect motion?	16.5381575797386
930.  it must	apparently be motion without termini.	23.729432886271383
931. because motion which begins and	ends at discrete places would be incomplete.	11.992542053365437
932. circular motion however since it is eternal and perfectly continuous	lacks termini.	13.094705794367433
933. it is never motion towards something.	29.999633864088118
934. only imcomplete	imperfect things move towards what they lack.	15.13750041235544
935. perfect complete	entities if they move at all do not move towards what they lack.	10.557230476263664
936. they move only in accordance with what is in their natures.	20.571306028009726
937. thus circular	motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely	perfect celestial existence.	11.504233005732154
938. to return now to the four-element	physics a mixture of muddy frothy water will when standing in	a jar separate out with earth at the bottom water on top and the	air on top of that.	11.129260105793302
939. a candle alight in the air directs its flame and	smoke upwards.	12.187205796510757
940. this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements.	19.689201935790898
941. thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe.	18.58423002023878
942. it is covered	with water air is atop of that.	23.061826067636904
943. pure fire is in	the heavens.	12.851133807717682
944. when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms	of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material	substratum it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a	scale of material-formal ratios celestial bodies will be of a subtle	quickened ethereal existence in whose embodiment pure form will be	the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.	8.66183752734138
945. the stars constitute an order of existence different from what	we encounter on earth.	10.890343919578495
946. this is clear when one distinguishes the types	of motion appropriate to both regions.	15.5513439616328
947. a projectile shot up from earth	returns rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest.	9.966061740790925
948. but the	natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest nor rectilinear	motion.	14.415712260916205
949. being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake	more of what is divine.	11.512228928699907
950. their motion will be eternal and perfect.	14.39488340464845
951. let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic	and copernican astronomy.	13.8561624543094
952. bluntly there never was a ptolemaic system	of astronomy.	12.3482207866056
953. copernicus' achievement was to have invented	systematic astronomy.	13.76415303011198
954. the almagest and the hypotheses outline	ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational	tables independent calculating devices for the prediction	of future planetary perturbations.	10.06134916292793
955. indeed in the halma edition of theon's	presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting	out otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing	the planetary motions.	9.087952781789342
956. no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld	into a single scheme these independent predicting-machines.	12.082610142849163
957. they all have this in common: the earth is situated	near the center of the deferent.	14.045194889584856
958. but that one should superimpose all	these charts run a pin through the common point and then scale each	planetary deferent larger and smaller	this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses.	10.135299254943483
959. he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity.	14.608277612379107
960. ptolemy's	problem is to forecast where against the inverted bowl of night some	particular light will be found at future times.	9.501504478359598
961. his problem concerns	longitudes latitudes and angular velocities.	12.610740830014443
962. the distances of these	points of light is a problem he cannot master beyond crude conjectures	as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth.	10.151943416599801
963. but none of this has prevented scientists philosophers and even	historians of science from speaking of the ptolemaic system in	contrast to the copernican.	9.943559043260201
964. it is engendered by	confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the	geocentric astronomy.	17.298960344313976
965. ptolemy recurrently denies that he could	ever explain planetary motion.	10.057988591011652
966. this is what necessitates the nonsystematic	character of his astronomy.	23.263905732124034
967. so when textbooks like that	of baker set out drawings of the 'ptolemaic system' complete	with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged	on their several deferents we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century	idea of what never existed historically.	8.58104873048367
968. it is	the chief merit in copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations	are interdependent.	14.69272383905615
969. he cannot eg compute the retrograde	arc traveled by mars without also making suppositions about the	earth's own motion.	10.200963639264403
970. he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining	some form of	a three-body problem.	15.870035203704841
971. in ptolemaic terms however eclipses	and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter to be explained	directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations.	9.360495243822294
972. in a	systematic astronomy like that of copernicus retrogradations become	part of the conceptual structure of the system; they are no longer	a puzzling aspect of intricately variable local planetary motions.	11.400204365805086
973. another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs	copernican astronomy turns on the idea of simplicity.	11.558390176802149
974. it is often	stated that copernican astronomy is 'simpler' than ptolemaic.	21.134190031152382
975. some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of	the former.	19.146648940761978
976. thus margenau remarks: a large number of unrelated	epicycles was needed to explain the observations but otherwise the	ptolemaic system served well and with quantitative precision.	12.295689919677812
977. copernicus	by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe	was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen.	14.425443320762508
978. historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the	fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution' unaware perhaps	of its historical importance he rested content with having produced	a simpler scheme for prediction.	8.482247297478708
979. as an illustration of the principle	of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because	it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves a reduction	in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen.	9.38836837677288
980. without careful qualification this can be misleading.	17.073061919935167
981. if in any one	calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once	while copernicus never required more than one third this number then	ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler	than copernican.	9.621356228029107
982. but no single planetary problem ever required	of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time.	13.056297168426227
983. this of course results	from the non-systematic 'cellular' character of ptolemaic	theory.	15.045086802071664
984. calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions	about planetary configurations.	11.33819267263277
985. these could be met only by considering	the dynamical elements of several planets at one time.	10.050802006624581
986. this	is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces	his isolated problems.	11.232850909607327
987. thus in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity'	is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican.	11.498148176062141
988. the latter required	juggling several elements simultaneously.	21.60616976697304
989. this was not simpler	but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy's astronomy.	14.534764959644006
990. analogously anyone who argues that einstein's theory of	gravitation is simpler than newton's must say rather more to explain	how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists while	the former can be managed only by accomplished experts.	9.52455970073556
991. in a sense einstein's theory is simpler than newton's	and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus' theory	is simpler than ptolemy's.	12.05394956235242
992. but 'simplicity' here refers to	systematic simplicity.	20.586081728985903
993. the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple	theories is reduced to a minimum.	16.776711103964328
994. the axioms required to	make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully	so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced	rigorously back to these axioms rules and primitive notions.	8.891886196032393
995. this	characterizes euclid's formulation of geometry but not ptolemy's	astronomy.	10.530932308755343
996. there are in the almagest no rules for determining	in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with	abberations in lunar solar or planetary behavior.	13.61524686624641
997. the strongest	appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this: ideally	the justification for dealing with special problems in particular	ways is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory.	8.719096024778251
998. the	lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc' never introduced ex	post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum.	9.159936216703418
999. copernicus to an extent unachieved by ptolemy approximated to	euclid's vision.	9.964895422211068
1000. de revolutionibus is not just a collection of	facts and techniques.	11.596445149948742
1001. it is an organized system of these things.	24.413779695661123
1002. solving	astronomical problems requires for copernicus not a random search	of unrelated tables but a regular employment of the rules defining	the entire discipline.	9.051154372622117
1003. hence noting the simplicity achieved	in copernicus' formulation does not provide another reason for	the acceptance of de revolutionibus another reason beyond its	systematic superiority.	8.28492014882349
1004. it provides exactly the same reason.	33.33999471958268
1005. 1543 ad is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific	revolution.	9.345058977386529
1006. it is really the funeral day of scholastic science.	24.01992799423903
1007. granted	the cosmological philosophical and cultural reverberations	initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence	during the 300 years to follow.	7.811867791937725
1008. but considered within technical	astronomy a different pattern can be traced.	14.997980485393471
1009. in what does the	dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist?	18.85751301149178
1010.  what in the	almagest draws his fire?	20.959134280836253
1011.  geocentricism per se?	16.13502295689442
1012.  no.	28.49691246350829
1013. the	formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus'	primary concern was introduced only to resolve what seemed	to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy namely the 'unphysical'	triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which	the planet's distances were calculated another around which planetary	velocities were computed and still a third center from	which the observations originated.	6.87477534737257
1014. this arrangement was for copernicus	literally monstrous: with the ptolemaists it is as though	an artist were to gather the hands feet head and other members	for his images from divers models each part excellently drawn but not	related to a single body; and since they in no way match each other	the result would be a monster rather than a man.	9.023829952863872
1015. copernicus	required a systematically integrated physically intelligible astronomy.	11.118618003375188
1016. his objective was essentially to repair those aspects of orthodox	astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends.	10.02372951974057
1017. that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy's theory was not	discovered de novo by copernicus.	11.087096821797813
1018. the critical rigorous examinations	of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context	for nicholas copernicus' own work.	10.551876137849225
1019. the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies.	16.586996006267984
1020. without abandoning	too much copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically	and mechanically acceptable.	11.43900460802661
1021. he did not think himself to be	firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution.	14.223006558004323
1022. henrietta's feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her	discovery of the coincidence that sara's epitaph in the jewish	cemetery in venice referred to her as the sulamite.	9.004182265081264
1023. into	the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta	as every artist delights to do wove strands of her own intuitive insights	into human nature and-	especially in the remarkable story of the	attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters	as this pair- into the relations of men and women: in their	relations she was the giver and he the receiver nay the demander.	6.794092412040163
1024. his	feeling always exacted sacrifices from her.	13.915190642667962
1025. h one is so accustomed	to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive and	women as submissive and yielding that our sympathies are usually enlisted	on the side of the man whose love is not returned and we condemn	the woman as a coquette h.	8.392734272518936
1026. the very firmness of her convictions and	logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to	make greater efforts; usually this is most exasperating to men who	expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her	sex and when she does not immediately condemn her as eccentric and	unwomanly h.	9.100887740853402
1027. she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist	of showing her superiority in argument over a man h.	10.28917199373269
1028. women themselves	have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside	world and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities	of a stronger will even when their affections are withheld h.	8.883904591744166
1029. she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where	it can consistently be done.	12.36045892157295
1030. one who invites such trials of character	is either foolhardy overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith	in mankind to see the danger.	11.729815010088274
1031. in any case but the last such a course	is sure to avenge itself upon the individual; the moral powers	no more than the physical and mental can bear overstraining.	10.675597249319734
1032. and in	the last case a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding	nature h.	11.923800709004192
1033. henrietta was discovering in the process of	writing as the born writer does not merely a channel for the discharge	of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the	creative powers of observation insight and intuition.	9.193819946848405
1034. dr	isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of	sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine	or harper's but he decided that its jewish subject probably	would not interest them and published it in the messenger	so our readers will be benefited instead.	9.770421342202834
1035. under her father's	influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects	outside the jewish field but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish	papers and thus increased her output and her audience.	8.047289694357326
1036. and	she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus	performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december.	11.438572018177657
1037. by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that	papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration.	8.09875985538735
1038. another source of intellectual stimulus was opened	to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within	walking distance of home.	0.0
1039. it was established in a couple of buildings	in the shopping district with only a few professors but all eminent	men and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings.	11.768601918408258
1040. in september '76 thomas huxley darwin's famous disciple came	from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening	of the university; and although it was a school for men only it	afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures.	10.30525649299614
1041. in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew	theology to johns hopkins students and this brought to the szold	house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to	study and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained	by henrietta and rachel who played and sang for them in the upstairs	sitting room on sunday evenings.	9.08077598310436
1042. from philadelphia came cyrus	adler and joseph	jastrow.	18.252415974230704
1043. adler judge sulzberger's nephew came to study assyriology.	10.530932308755343
1044. a smart shrewd and ambitious young man well connected and with	a knack for getting in the good graces of important people he was	bound to go far.	9.555748069437293
1045. joseph jastrow the younger son of the distinguished	rabbi marcus jastrow was a friendly round-faced fellow with a	little mustache whose field was psychology and who was also a punster	and a jolly tease.	7.687613969373264
1046. his father was a good friend of rabbi szold and	joe lived with the szolds for a while.	12.326406751145452
1047. both these youths who greatly	admired henrietta were somewhat younger than she as were also	the neighboring friedenwald	boys who were then studying medicine;	and bright though they all were they could not possibly compete for	her interest with papa whose mind- although he never tried to dazzle	or patronize lesser lights with it- naturally eclipsed theirs and	made them seem to her even younger than they were.	6.73445504510883
1048. besides miss henrietta-	as she was generally known since she had put up her hair	with a chignon in the back- had little time to spare them from her	teaching and writing; so cyrus adler became interested in her friend	racie friedenwald and joe jastrow- the only young man who when	he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta and signed	himself joe- fell in love with pretty sister rachel.	7.898005107875224
1049. henrietta	however was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with	joe's older and more serious brother morris who was just about	her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia	with papa when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph	shalom temple there during its rabbi's absence in europe.	0.0
1050. young	morris who while attending the university of pennsylvania also	taught and edited a paper found time to write henrietta twenty-page	letters on everything that engaged his interest from the acting of sarah	bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of	sulamith on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the	hebrew union college in cincinnati.	7.976249028384366
1051. unlike his younger brother	joe he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as my	dear friend although he praised and envied the elegance and purity	of her style.	7.7250880196120555
1052. and when he complained of the lack of time for all	he wanted to do henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning	as she and papa did.	12.229154689709176
1053. one thing papa had not taught henrietta	was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as	herself.	12.211179494150286
1054. she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority	in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the	feminine follies of sara sullam; and in her forthright way	henrietta who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness	to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive	and yielding felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers	to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception- he objected	to her stand on the corbin affair as well as on the radical reforms	of dr wise of hebrew union college- until once in sheer	desperation he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree	on anything.	8.588184310560539
1055. but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters	or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable	lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street.	9.857183396655468
1056. little women	we've got father and mother	and each other h said beth on the first page of louisa alcott's	little women; and i do think that families are the	most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo some five hundred	pages later in that popular story of the march family which had	first appeared when henrietta was eight; and the szold family as	it developed bore a striking resemblance to the marches.	8.564108060292014
1057. mr	march like benjamin szold was a clergyman although of an indeterminate	denomination; and marmee march like sophie szold	was the competent manager of her brood of girls of whom the marches	had only four to the szolds' five.	7.239418449714584
1058. but the march girls had their	counterparts in the szold girls.	17.049321005137298
1059. henrietta could easily identify	herself with jo march although jo was not the eldest sister.	9.551720311633886
1060. neither	was henrietta hoydenish like jo who frankly wished she were a	boy and had deliberately shortened her name which like henrietta's	was the feminine form of a boy's name.	9.046681411630516
1061. but both were high-spirited	and vivacious both had tempers to control both loved languages	especially english and german both were good teachers and wrote for	publication.	8.736484653761185
1062. each was her mother's assistant and confidante; and	each stood out conspicuously in the family picture.	12.182788359468164
1063. bertha szold	was more like meg the eldest march girl who learned that a	woman's happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling	it not as a queen but a wise wife and mother.	7.93473294484396
1064. bertha blue-eyed	like mamma was from the start her mother's daughter destined for	her mother's role in life.	10.649597806161383
1065. sadie like beth march suffered ill	health- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart-	but that never dampened her spirits.	9.246816285017209
1066. when her right hand was incapacitated	by the rheumatism sadie learned to write with her left hand.	11.937378943914908
1067. she	wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments like oh	what fun! a comedy in three acts in which under personages	henrietta appeared as a schoolmarm and bertha	who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta	had been appeared as dummkopf.	7.207114523643355
1068. sadie studied piano; played	chopin in the soiree musicale of mr guthrie's pupils;	and she recited hector's farewell to andromache most	movingly to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown	near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting	between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds' in baltimore.	8.209656833554858
1069. adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious	mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one.	8.29272515769823
1070. for rachel	conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls- and she did make	a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing	in her silvery tones- there was no particular march counterpart;	but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences	the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere	if not entirely in content- the one being definitely jewish	and the other vaguely christian.	8.480872381791539
1071. the szolds like the marches	enjoyed and loved living together even in troubled times; and	as in the march home any young man who called on the szolds found	himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult	to direct his particular attention to any one of them.	7.926981307443808
1072. this	included mamma jolly generous and pretty with whom they all fell	in love just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before	he chose her; and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed	the szold hospitality he felt obliged to send his respects and	his gifts not merely to henrietta in whom he was really interested	but to all the szold girls and mamma.	8.200206564451339
1073. and just as laurie lawrence	was first attracted to bright jo march who found him immature	by her high standards and then had to content himself with her younger	sister amy so joe jastrow who had also been writing henrietta	before he came to johns hopkins had to content himself with her	younger sister pretty rachel.	7.599887527844025
1074. and like jo march who saw her sisters	meg and amy involved in lovering before herself henrietta	saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle	by the attraction of suitors rachel by joe jastrow and sadie by	max lo^bl a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions	of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi.	8.203678029578443
1075. this time he was making no mistake.	21.15055399335313
1076. olgivanna- in her country	the	nickname was a respectful form of address- was not only attractive but	shrewd durable sensible and smart.	10.105072401223069
1077. no wonder wright was enchanted-	no two better suited people ever met.	11.319591076749614
1078. almost from that day until	his death olgivanna was to stay at his side; but the years that	immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying both for wright	and his montenegrin lady.	10.426967254185909
1079. it must be granted that the flouting	of convention no matter how well intentioned one may be is sure	to lead to trouble or at least to the discomfort that goes with social	disapproval.	11.072312123814278
1080. even so many of the things that happened to wright	and olgivanna seem inordinately severe.	21.389285086299193
1081. their afflictions centered	on one maddening difficulty: miriam held up the divorce proceedings	that she herself had asked for.	8.586562397406464
1082. reporters began to trail miriam everywhere	and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright	and his doings.	9.559225930701576
1083. flocks of writs attachments and unpleasant legal	papers of every sort began to fly through the air.	8.29272515769823
1084. the distracted miriam	would agree to a settlement through her legal representative then	change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person.	10.595419296232127
1085. at	last her lawyer arthur d cloud gave up the case because she	turned down three successive settlements he arranged.	8.713840397838554
1086. cloud made an interesting	statement in parting from his client: i wanted to be	a lawyer and mrs wright wanted me to be an avenging angel.	10.247836828762457
1087. mrs wright is without funds.	15.138078026303159
1088. the first thing to do is	get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final	disposition of the case.	12.84056775248169
1089. but every time i suggested this to her	mrs wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish	mr wright.	10.445544823468731
1090. i am an attorney not an instrument of vengeance.	17.960428166194806
1091. miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor	and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take	his place.	7.926126696138708
1092. there were three years of this strange warfare;	and during the unhappy time miriam often would charge that wright and	olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin.	12.058043203507928
1093. yet somehow when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to	execute the warrants they would find neither wright nor olgivanna	at home.	8.540909098523793
1094. this showed that common sense had not died out at the county	and village level- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced	woman was not restrained remains a puzzle.	10.037058577338499
1095. the misery of miriam's	bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it was	hopeless agonizing and destructive with miriam herself bearing the	heaviest burden of shame and pain.	7.849136012525135
1096. to get an idea of the embarrassment	and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna we	should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person.	12.52203085586671
1097. one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring	green toward the end of the open warfare on a beautiful day in june.	15.244235308848662
1098. at this time miriam noel appeared urging on constable henry pengally	whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers	in the neighborhood.	14.003550818348737
1099. a troop of reporters brought up the rear.	13.033050378532822
1100. miriam	was stopped at the taliesin gate and william weston now the	estate foreman came out to parley.	10.266416619991896
1101. he said that mr wright was	not in and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant	that miriam was waving in the air.	10.787625561718706
1102. miriam now ordered pengally to	break down the gate but he said he really couldn't go that far.	10.956531468248773
1103. at	this point mrs frances cupply one of wright's handsome daughters	by his first wife came from the house and tried to calm miriam	as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane	on another sign with a rock.	8.255080183071176
1104. miriam noel wright said here	i am at my own home locked out so i must stand in the road!	then she rounded on weston and cried you always did wright's	dirty work! when i take over taliesin the first thing i'll	do is fire you.	8.340471105578633
1105. madame noel i think you had better	go said mrs cupply.	11.240735600163324
1106. and i think you had better	leave replied miriam.	28.454870257253386
1107. turning to the reporters she asked did	you hear her?	14.980138491902384
1108.  'i think you had better leave'! and this	is my own home.	10.957705180640192
1109. in the silence that followed miriam walked close	to mrs cupply who drew back a step on her side of the gate.	11.242436918406938
1110. then	with staring eyes and lips drawn thin miriam said to the young woman	you are ugly- uglier than you used to be and you were always	very ugly.	10.202626129639839
1111. you are even uglier than mr wright.	19.3610853436887
1112. the	animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a	natural force; and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that	of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art.	8.309719998126587
1113. as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement	at all miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him; she	also went to washington and appealed to senator george william	norris of nebraska the fighting liberal from whose office a sympathetic	but cautious harrumphing was heard.	8.263959128184558
1114. then after overtures to	accept a settlement and go through with a divorce miriam gave a ghastly	echo of mrs micawber by suddenly stating i will never leave	mr wright.	9.364050225708711
1115. under this kind of pressure it is not	surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers.	10.561153589194841
1116. miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly but one	can feel the generalized anger in wright's remarks to reporters	when he was asked one morning on arrival in chicago what he thought	of the city as a whole.	8.21857681601413
1117. first wright said he was choked by the smoke	which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town.	10.03008663609632
1118. but surely	michigan avenue was handsome?	23.28422695159905
1119.  that isn't a boulevard it's	a racetrack! cried wright showing that automobiles were considered	to be a danger as early as the 1920's.	9.768725623393086
1120. this is a horrible	way to live wright went on.	23.043202015946864
1121. you are being strangled by traffic.	21.843306234560625
1122. he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty and began	to talk trenchant sense though private anguish showed through in the	vehemence of his manner.	12.240791396869596
1123. take a gigantic knife and sweep it over	the loop wright said.	11.116701193376628
1124. cut off every building at the seventh	floor.	15.244451781295366
1125. you don't need concentration.	12.04468271272188
1126. if	you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams.	12.782551617045769
1127. you'll have some joy in the life of	this city.	7.652251689202024
1128. after all that's the job of the architect- to give	the world a little joy.	14.77934351771678
1129. little enough joy was afforded wright	in the spring of 1925 when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin.	8.813785338596942
1130. the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by	a bolt of lightning as though miriam could call down fire from heaven	like a prophet of the old testament.	10.64841354439613
1131. a storm did take place that	night and fortunately enough it included a cloudburst that helped put	out the flames.	8.810595225531808
1132. later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting	the fire; at any rate heat grew so intense in the main part of the	house that it melted the window panes and fused the k'ang-si pottery	to cinders.	9.184560722681512
1133. wright set his loss at $200000 a figure perhaps justified	by the unique character of the house that had been ruined and	the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and	other things that were destroyed.	8.768389644473164
1134. in spite of the disaster wright	completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort in which	he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees- a project of	great and appropriate charm that came to nothing.	11.33463991742125
1135. amid a shortage of	profitable work the memory of albert johnson's $20000 stood out	in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted away.	8.383311998639526
1136. a series of	conferences with friends and bankers began about this time; and the	question before these meetings was here is a man of international reputation	and proved earning power; how can he be financed so that he	can find the work he ought to do?	10.335327222015803
1137.  while this was under consideration	dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3.	9.667514183976124
1138. as he made plans for the new taliesin wright also got on	paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation	of all faiths and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping	ramp.	11.328505502786815
1139. years were to pass before these plans came off the paper and	wright was justified in thinking as the projects failed that much	of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except	by visitors to taliesin.	8.726326341130568
1140. and now there was some question as to	his continued residence there.	16.238720717188432
1141. billy koch who had once worked for	wright as a chauffeur gave a deposition for miriam's use that he	had seen olgivanna living at taliesin.	8.135694531105091
1142. this might put wright in such	a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin;	nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he	was not compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills useless	hotel bills and useless doctor's bills he could more quickly	provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris	as she preferred.	9.460747881685034
1143. miriam sniffed at this and complained that wright	had said unkind things about her to reporters.	8.450640073948662
1144. his reply was everything	that has been printed derogatory to you purporting to have	come from me was a betrayal and nothing yet has been printed which	i have sanctioned.	9.072588945848924
1145. what irritated miriam was that wright had told	the papers about a reasonable offer he had made which he considered	she would accept when she tires of publicity.	8.771819579821807
1146. from her california	headquarters miriam fired back i shall never divorce mr	wright to permit him to marry olga milanoff.	10.780413433503007
1147. then miriam	varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing	a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending and asking	for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with the understanding that wright	would not contest it.	8.745271791934675
1148. the bank of wisconsin sent a representative	to the judge's chambers in madison to give information on wright's	ability to meet the terms.	11.259478656319086
1149. he said that the architect might reasonably	be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment	could be brought to an end and that the bank would accept a mortgage	on taliesin to help bring this about.	9.71310704898051
1150. miriam said that she must be	assured that that other woman olga will not be in luxury while i	am scraping along.	11.050377328186379
1151. this exhausted wright's patience and in consequence	he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite.	9.82318807338626
1152. volstead	laws speed laws divorce laws he said as they now	stand demoralize the individual make liars and law breakers of us in	one way or another and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd.	8.742922682289619
1153. if mrs wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning i'll	go either to tokyo or to holland to do what i can.	9.682397475537686
1154. i realize	in taking this stand just what it means to me and mine.	18.353308816512193
1155. here wright	gave a slight sigh of weariness and continued it means more	long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people	making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding	as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me.	9.991619474618503
1156. next	day word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce;	but wright stayed in the united states.	13.767303139487057
1157. his mentioning of japan and	holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking.	9.58414098581741
1158. no matter	what troubles might betide him this most american of artists knew	in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land.	10.518898244866394
1159. in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin but	was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates.	12.89302810688928
1160. more likely you simply told yourself as you handed us the book that	it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline	of incantation.	9.728099505724597
1161. for pride's sake i will not say that	the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into	my soul.	9.240193164515782
1162. besides that particular message does no more than weakly echo	the roar in all fresh blood.	12.130751039231692
1163. but what you could not know of course	was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american	fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents	were to come if not of age then into a bright taut semblance of it.	8.38422520272327
1164. i do not suppose you ever heard of f scott fitzgerald living	or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you had his legend	would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval.	12.605330047887557
1165. neither his appetites his exacerbations nor his despair were	kin to yours.	10.667094776077697
1166. he might have been the man in the moon for all you could	have understood him.	21.128308236671668
1167. but he was no man in the moon to me.	22.194420003070736
1168. although	his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of nor was it for yachts	sports cars tall drinks and swimming pools nor yet for money or	what money buys that i burned i too was burning and watching myself	burn.	8.271122258864628
1169. the flame was simply of a different kind.	13.71036219133766
1170. it was symbolized	by that	self-consuming elegiac candle of edna st vincent millay's	that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a	beacon to us but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall	as a funeral taper to last even the evening let alone the night.	11.192461251755772
1171. one	should not of course pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume	to linger on.	8.29272515769823
1172. yet this passion for passion now that i look back	on it with passion spent seems somewhat overblown and operatic though	as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes.	9.53021373833984
1173. only what	else was she singing but the old song of songs that most ancient	of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves?	8.072176837580809
1174. 	perhaps this is not so little.	22.340511341980974
1175. perhaps the mere fact that by	plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us temporarily	anyway the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their	immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to	which we can attest?	8.365642157397744
1176.  one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone	casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives	for a lover or a friend; one can take it as no more than another	veil torn from the mystery of the soul.	10.421836908252484
1177. but it could also be looked	at from the other end of the spectrum.	23.88545915620627
1178. one could see this chemical determinant	as in itself a miracle.	17.98920461447968
1179. in any case miss millay's sweet-throated	bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was	not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant	and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since	it required no scenery or props drew from the me that i was when	i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.	7.725554586306017
1180. but all this i	am well aware is the bel canto of love and although i have always	liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone	that i listened i know well enough that it was not.	11.259871382241718
1181. if i am to speak	the whole truth about my knowledge of love i will have to stop	trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale.	11.926604896545523
1182. there is another side	of love more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie	or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug.	12.294328728482864
1183. whether	you experienced the passion of desire i have of course no way	of knowing nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment	of a wish to know for the fact that one constitutes by one's	mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any	speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest	more scandalizing more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from	a stranger.	7.7684938302596835
1184. i recoil from the very thought.	21.412278484250145
1185. at the same time i am	aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves	at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science	of paradox: if one hates they say it is because one loves;	if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns	they say it is because one desires; and according to them whatever	one fancies one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite.	8.829774909649272
1186. well	normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious		i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion.	10.101433090063678
1187. you	probably would not remember since you never seemed to remember	even	the same moments as i much less their intensity one sunny midday on	fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping	less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance	at the farm.	7.077741170083488
1188. i can see us now.	33.0750575750441
1189. we had been walking quite briskly	for despite your being so small and me so tall your stride in those	days could easily match mine.	9.384268279554249
1190. we had stopped before a shop window	to assess its autumnal display when you suddenly turned to me looking	up from beneath one of your wrong hats and with your nervous ahem!	said: there are things i must tell you about this man you	are marrying which he does not know himself.	9.716398290319919
1191. if you had screamed	right there in the street where we stood i could not have felt more	fear.	15.7479804856166
1192. with scarcely a mumble of excuse i fled.	15.967643284304824
1193. i fled however	not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise	from you that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you	meant the word things- which you had been galvanizing yourself	to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which	i had already insisted upon finding out for myself	say the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle	because i was resolved as	a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize	life by the throat.	8.049430098854941
1194. i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid	of self-betrayal.	16.36643021440957
1195. what i fled from was my fear of what unwittingly	you might betray without meaning to about my father and yourself.	9.701495778730436
1196. but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much	more arbitrary and influential it is than the will.	13.203833286051069
1197. while my memory	holds with relentless tenacity as i cannot too often stress to my wrongs	when it comes to my shames it gestures and jokes and toys with	chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from	them.	8.06492561102558
1198. just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside	of the leaf of love memory displeased at being asked to yield its	unsavory secrets dashed ahead of me calling back over its shoulder:	skip it.	10.030223023947922
1199. but i will not skip it or cut it	out.	17.73355831773685
1200. it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless	victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings	of chance.	13.873551064013636
1201. if to be innocent is to be helpless then i had been-	as are we all- helpless at the start.	11.30338263246033
1202. but the time came when i was	no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless.	16.057395907002206
1203. helpless in that	sense i can never be again.	11.746215557031444
1204. however i confess my hope that i	will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but	rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh	to reach the bone.	8.87520506155676
1205. for innocence of all the graces of the	spirit is i believe the one most to be prayed for.	11.058897596695115
1206. although it is constantly	made to look foolish	it does not	mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks.	14.483654128632098
1207. it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when	they seem worst it overlooks them.	9.981052948240189
1208. to innocence a word given is a word	that will be kept.	13.109422852138021
1209. instinctively innocence does unto others as it	expects to be done by.	11.565338289694184
1210. but when these expectations are once too often	ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according	to the strength of him who possesses it.	11.175762792921255
1211. the innocence of which	i speak is i know not incorruptible.	12.000419380818434
1212. but i insist upon believing	that even when it is lost it may like paradise be regained.	16.940746666822598
1213. however it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking	but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of	it which is innocence in romantic love.	9.86033226067833
1214. here if anywhere it is not	wholly incontrovertible.	17.510417068873625
1215. to you for instance the word innocence in	this connotation probably retained its biblical or should i say	technical sense and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear	by saying that i lost- or rather handed over- what you would	have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled	and in fact by oath required to hand it over along with what other	goods and bads i had.	6.897976864125435
1216. but to me innocence is far less tangible.	22.269746895150078
1217. i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my	trust in you but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved	through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience	a flaming delight that had nothing nothing whatever to do with	friendship or liking let alone with love.	7.468024500019652
1218. i knew this knowledge to	be corrupting at the time i acquired it; today these many years later	after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions	and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured i call it	corrupting still.	10.15890352986748
1219. you i could swear to it remained innocent	in this sense until the end.	11.436991015185901
1220. yours but not mine was an age in which	innocence was fostered and carefully- if not perhaps altogether	innocently- preserved.	9.412054727957594
1221. you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing	mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across	her face.	12.310988390408376
1222. moreover because of the particular blot on your family	escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your	grandmother's part and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle	bed of your childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desired	with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your	whole will sensibility and intelligence upon was to be a lady.	8.678955000717863
1223. before	being daughter wife or mother before being cultured	bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen	before being sorry for the poor progressive	about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian	indeed first and foremost you were a lady.	7.1095011669928665
1224. there was of course	more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than	the sine qua non of her virtue.	13.006956137967828
1225. a lady you made clear to me both	by precept and example never raised her voice or slumped in her chair	never failed in social tact	never pouted or withdrew or	scandalized in company never reminded others of her physical presence	by unseemly sound or gesture never indulged in public scenes or private	confidences never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering	never gossiped or maligned never stressed but always minimized	the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself.	6.79035163478069
1226. with each song he gave verbal footnotes.	17.25732894350573
1227. the songs sandburg sang often	reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely	or in fragments.	9.189554574368655
1228. often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons	who had similar ballads or ditties.	11.388530127117274
1229. in due time sandburg was	a walking thesaurus of american folk music.	15.169094620755002
1230. after he had finished	the first two volumes of his lincoln sandburg went to work	assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the	memory of songs others had taught him.	9.754741475613042
1231. he rummaged found composers	and arrangers collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization	with musicians ballad singers and musicologists.	9.199589164023873
1232. the	result was a collection of 280 songs ballads ditties brought together	from all regions of america more than one hundred never before published:	the american songbag.	10.529760588445207
1233. each song or ditty was prefaced	by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the	song as well as special interest the song had musical arrangement	and most of the chorus and verses.	8.35828331261954
1234. the book published in 1927	has been selling steadily ever since.	14.368071041996593
1235. as sandburg said at the time:	it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to	the appalachian mountains it is as modern as skyscrapers the volstead	act and the latest oil well gusher.	8.224301100222632
1236. sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer.	12.3482207866056
1237. two things	contribute to his popularity.	15.461937182626903
1238. first carl respects his audience and	prepares his speeches carefully.	14.119402008931523
1239. even when he is called upon for impromptu	remarks he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes.	15.320463344475009
1240. he has his own system of shorthand devised by abbreviations: humility	will be humly with will be w and that	will be tt.	11.280688172173253
1241. the second reason for his popularity	is his complete spontaneity with the guitar.	12.792293878736368
1242. it is a mistake however	to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop.	18.16495644257398
1243. he is no dextrous-fingered	college boy but rather a dedicated humble and bashful	apostle of this instrument.	12.802113372243412
1244. at age seventy-four he became what he	shyly terms a pupil of andres segovia the great guitarist of	the western world.	10.91523986023326
1245. it is not easy to become segovia's pupil.	28.50244475669657
1246. segovia has written about carl:	his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help	in disciplining them.	9.622156136590998
1247. i found that this precocious grown-up boy of	74 deserved to be taught.	13.64312786556314
1248. there has long existed a brotherly affection	between us thus i accepted him as my pupil.	15.463093334710116
1249. just as in the case of	every prodigy child we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to	show up in the future- if he should master all the strenuous exercises	i inflicted on him.	10.412575220045662
1250. to play the guitar as he aspires will	devour his three-fold energy as a historian a poet and a singer.	11.319953172457401
1251. one	cause of schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to	learn the guitar.	12.026700669616675
1252. i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into	the same sad philosophy.	14.288627928755243
1253. the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles	forth a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar.	11.190465584513738
1254. the public's identification of carl sandburg and the guitar	is no happenstance.	12.957840546200554
1255. nor does carl reject this identity.	17.59516480409941
1256. he	is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him	titled the guitar.	10.599582093720509
1257. carl says it is the greatest poem	ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem	to that subtle instrument.	9.443522621228205
1258. a portable companion always ready to	go where you go- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant-	to be shared with few or many- just two of you in sweet meditation.	9.617505557717042
1259. the new york herald tribune's photographer	ira rosenberg tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a	picture of carl playing a guitar.	11.133534623557825
1260. carl hadn't brought his along.	15.068811854765874
1261. mr	rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one.	11.437419889797859
1262. preferably	said carl one battered and worn such as might be found	in a pawnshop.	10.854193712482285
1263. they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller	of 1162 sixth avenue.	14.539196012528393
1264. mr miller was in the shop	the herald tribune story related but was reluctant to have	anybody's picture taken inside because his business was too 'confidential'	for pictures.	10.114212738416004
1265. but after introductions he asked:	'carl sandburg?	21.99217952035773
1266.  well you can pose inside'.	19.344035855825307
1267. he wanted mr sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had	displayed behind glass in the center of his shop but the poet eyed this	somewhat distastefully.	12.755280773907197
1268. 'kalamazoo guitars' he said 'used	by radio hillbilly singers'.	12.3482207866056
1269. he chose one from mr miller's	window a plain guitar with no fancy polish.	10.829607627746384
1270. while the picture	was taken mr miller's disposition to be generous to mr	sandburg increased to the point where he advised 'i won't even	charge you the one dollar rental fee'.	10.681759930262537
1271. when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to	be a celebrity carl said a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery	with celerity.	9.074972397617172
1272. this has always been carl's attitude.	25.966317689623136
1273. lloyd lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in 1916 sandburg was	making $27.	11.289839213480207
1274. 50 a week writing features for the day book and eating	sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants.	13.297670351663255
1275. he walked home at night	for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley.	14.735455518397835
1276. when fame	came it changed sandburg only slightly.	17.92356274941414
1277. lewis remembered another newspaperman	asking carl have your ideas changed any since you got	all these comforts?	8.450640073948662
1278.    carl thought the question over slowly	and answered: i know a starving man who is fed never remembers	all the pangs of his starvation i know that.	9.832458466525106
1279. that was all	he said lewis reports.	19.6913193671552
1280. that was all he had to say.	28.934883984754688
1281. in answer	to a new york times query on what is fame	carl said: fame is a figment of a	pigment.	11.073110263460906
1282. it changes with every generation.	42.22322958713869
1283. there	never were two fames alike.	12.851133807717682
1284. one fame is precious and luminous; another	is a bubble of a bauble.	13.080146454615873
1285. plain?	24.303019953065355
1286. 	the impression you get from carl sandburg's home is	one of laughter and happiness; and the laughter and the happiness are	even more pronounced when no company is present.	8.679382077655589

1327. carl and paula met in milwaukee	in 1907 during paula's christmas holiday visit to her parents.	8.450640073948662
1328. carl	was still charles a sandburg.	15.068811854765874
1329. he legitimized paula for	lilian steichen and it was paula who insisted on carl for charles.	11.374039082009114
1330. victor berger the panjandrum of wisconsin socialism and	member of congress had asked paula steichen to translate some of	his german editorials into english.	8.951887347307554
1331. carl who was stationed in appleton	wisconsin organizing for the social democrats was in berger's	office and made it his business to escort paula to the streetcar.	7.781684207522309
1332. she left the next day for her teaching job at princeton illinois.	16.127199739427223
1333. for two years in the normal school at valley city north dakota	then two years at princeton by	the time the streetcar pulled away he had fallen in love with paula.	9.962662865500096
1334. a letter awaited her at princeton.	17.080381861043524
1335. paula says that even	though carl's letters usually began dear miss steichen there	was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband	and wife.	9.647710281906159
1336. paula generously lent me one of carl's love	letters dated february 21 1908 hotel athearn oshkosh wisconsin:	dear miss steichen: it is a very good letter you	send me- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare i am carrying	on up here.	9.064250542515564
1337. never until in this work of s-d organization	have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher.	9.160886982964659
1338. the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet	union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that	may lead to peace with justice.	12.286951805298042
1339. certainly it is not necessary	to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in	the internal affairs of any nation; by the same token we reject any	soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force	or subversion.	10.319336699474654
1340. now this concern for the freedom of other peoples	is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with	more than forty other nations in a common defense effort.	11.233986891223719
1341. not for a	moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these	countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our	solemn commitments to them.	9.522122275464252
1342. we and our friends are of course	concerned with self-defense.	15.328138173534445
1343. growing out of this concern is the realization	that all people of the free world have a great stake in the	progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations.	10.835561874024695
1344. these peoples desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels	of living must not by our neglect be forced to seek help from and	finally become virtual satellites of those who proclaim their hostility	to freedom.	9.352178624639066
1345. but they must have technical and investment assistance.	18.832763970270022
1346. this is a problem to be solved not by america alone but also	by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide	help.	14.421151755636007
1347. in recent years america's partners and friends in	western europe and japan have made great economic progress.	12.899547311870746
1348. the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of	the early postwar years.	12.649322662470915
1349. no longer is the united states the only major	industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the	resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries.	10.39696373108473
1350. to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nations must extend	the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will	inspire hope confidence and progress.	9.662177444338578
1351. a rich nation can for a time	without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self-indulgence	making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-	thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful	and prosperous society of nations.	7.261415840748493
1352. but the enmities it will incur	the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral	and spiritual softness that will be engendered will in the long term	bring it to economic and political disaster.	11.232632098294314
1353. america did not	become great through softness and self-indulgence.	12.176503681774644
1354. her miraculous progress	in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy	and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant	with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction in hard work; the readiness	to sacrifice for worthwhile causes; the courage to meet every	challenge; the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the	true path of her own best interests.	8.25417879876935
1355. to us and to every nation	of the free world rich or poor these qualities are necessary today	as never before if we are to march together to greater security prosperity	and peace.	9.860478413798292
1356. i believe that the industrial countries are	ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing	nations to achieve progress.	17.318869022052446
1357. the immediate need for	this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's	international balance of payments.	9.597484993134012
1358. our surplus from foreign business	transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the	expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas	to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the	less developed nations.	9.586401290861954
1359. in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments	approached four billion dollars.	14.351631920668508
1360. continuing deficits of anything	like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth	and check the forward progress of the free world.	9.578268283512474
1361. we must	meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world	trade.	10.79494259960503
1362. further we must induce all industrialized nations of the free	world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less	fortunate.	10.114769504004451
1363. this co-operation in this matter will provide both for	the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further	increases in mutually profitable trade.	8.64731194555216
1364. new nations and	others struggling with the problems of development will progress only-	regardless of any outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their	own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it.	9.218083994427857
1365. moreover	progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned;	there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane.	7.5781175290231655
1366. but just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years	so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith	and determination deserve help.	9.736074563328813
1367. respecting their need one of	the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region.	8.450640073948662
1368. here	in two nations alone are almost five hundred million people all working	and working hard to raise their standards and in doing so to	make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology	that would destroy liberty.	9.429690201952265
1369. i cannot express to you the depth	of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must co-operate	with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions	as expressed in their different multi-year plans.	8.686463947630312
1370. through the	world bank and other instrumentalities as well as through individual	action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face	this titanic challenge.	10.690161572839367
1371. i shall continue to urge the american	people in the interests of their own security prosperity and peace	to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and	cheerfully supported.	10.00599908901905
1372. free world decisions in this matter may spell the	difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom.	10.69349248760181
1373. other countries some of which i visited last month have similar	needs.	12.387603078123698
1374. a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations	which are prepared to assist in the development effort.	14.286682379733392
1375. during the	past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western	nations.	11.667179216518823
1376. because of its wealth of experience the organization	for european economic cooperation could help with the initial	studies needed.	14.140349316953172
1377. the goal is to enlist all available economic resources	in the industrialized free world especially private investment	capital.	10.392891242391038
1378. by extending this help we hope to make possible the	enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner.	10.504847201675323
1379. no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be	imagined.	13.535619916584995
1380. if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive	partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have	already achieved a high state of economic advancement we will make	brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom.	10.371139124160141
1381. otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed.	13.9349100623339
1382. we face indeed what	may be a turning point in history and we must act decisively and wisely.	11.243345137160563
1383. as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives	only from a position of broadly based strength.	11.665755235612208
1384. no matter how	earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree	of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating	the issue of arms reduction.	12.439390226393765
1385. until tangible and mutually enforceable	arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the	means of defending our institutions.	9.040820488194184
1386. america possesses an enormous	defense power.	18.287459951268666
1387. it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever	risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as	to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support.	9.24618743838424
1388. it is world-wide	knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack	the united states by surprise even though we might sustain great	losses would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction.	11.417518421730584
1389. but i once	again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states	except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power.	12.423327121600316
1390. during the past year our long-range striking power unmatched today	in manned bombers has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory.	12.383141291197374
1391. in	fourteen recent test launchings at ranges of five thousand miles atlas	has been striking on an average within two miles of the target.	7.8979345124211
1392. this is less than the length of a jet runway- well within the circle	of destruction.	19.835649995420688
1393. incidentally there was an atlas firing last	night.	13.545158885436141
1394. from all reports so far received its performance conformed to	the high standards i have just described.	12.720803620063764
1395. such performance is a great	tribute to american scientists and engineers who in the past five	years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range	ballistic missiles where america had none before.	9.042480551021479
1396. this	year moreover growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will	enter our active forces some to be armed with polaris missiles.	10.226399657875731
1397. these	remarkable ships and weapons ranging the oceans will be capable of	accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth.	8.026882005052693
1398. to meet	situations of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain	our carrier forces our many service units abroad our always ready	army strategic forces and marine corps divisions and the civilian	components.	9.252752106225442
1399. the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly	but necessary process.	11.050834287616778
1400. it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which	will steadily add to our strength.	20.612809246674484
1401. the deployment of a portion	of these forces beyond our shores on land and sea is persuasive demonstration	of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our	allies for collective security.	7.9194897122132115
1402. moreover i have directed that steps	be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to	these allies.	10.317148984897955
1403. this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system.	21.060927394781167
1404. next i refer to our program in space exploration which	is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research	and development.	11.109278849340225
1405. we note that first america has already	made	great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of	knowledge of astrophysics and space science.	10.042586073095322
1406. these discoveries are of	present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are	important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space	for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.	8.970602097259915
1407. second our military	missile program going forward so successfully does not suffer from	our present lack of very large rocket engines which are necessary	in distant space exploration.	7.737692234904977
1408. i am assured by experts that the thrust	of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.	12.402319229867922
1409. third the united states is pressing forward in the development	of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space	for exploration purposes.	9.978582163111758
1410. fourth in the meantime it is necessary	to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately	surrounding the earth.	11.112893186845643
1411. using launch systems presently available	we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite	relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the	globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and	aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the	data we seek.	7.204973973976912
1412. fifth we have just completed a year's experience	with our new space law.	11.816682571050746
1413. i believe it deficient in certain particulars.	26.614223450633474
1414. suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly.	13.269625631309555
1415. the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires	the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual	and	economic sinews of american life.	9.31982837790953
1416. the steady purpose of our society	is to assure justice before god for every individual.	11.636095537390238
1417. we must be	ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing	of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the	issues of the day.	9.339525384192015
1418. a year ago when i met with you the nation	was emerging from an economic downturn even though the signs of resurgent	prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful.	11.350588480497809
1419. today our surging strength is apparent to everyone.	13.407319045471242
1420. 1960 promises	to be the most prosperous year in our history.	12.686881839370903
1421. yet we continue	to be afflicted by nagging disorders.	14.731986384554281
1422. among current problems that	require solutions participated in by citizens as well as government	are:   the need to protect the public interest in situations of	prolonged labor-management stalemate;   the persistent refusal	to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture;	the continuing threat of inflation together with	the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;   in certain	instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection	of the law.	8.924981562793649
1423. the group upon the issuance of its first press release on december	21 1957 designated itself a committee of investigation.	11.28168410159972
1424. in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses.	20.172358804542146
1425. it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer adolf a berle	jr once.	13.338720697010135
1426. its second press release was on january 15	1958 and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed.	11.000310780667883
1427. it also	implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible.	16.429789018110487
1428. on	january 18 ernest gross conducted a press conference at the un	lasting an hour.	13.009692928684878
1429. here he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred	to his aberrant conduct.	12.665823488407382
1430. this conference was held despite	stavropoulos' assurance to adolf berle who was leaving the same	day for puerto rico that nothing would be done until his return on	january 22 except that the secretary general would probably order	the list destroyed.	10.714985486043265
1431. on january 24 paul bang-jensen accompanied	by adolf berle was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel	frank begley former police chief of farmington conn and now	head of un special police.	8.249190457778052
1432. the four bundled in overcoats	mounted to the wind-swept roof of the un   there	begley lit a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen dropped four	sealed envelopes into the flames.	9.195928132121104
1433. in one of these he said were notes	on the identities of the eighty-one refugees.	17.88987416880453
1434. the method of destroying	the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen.	20.29683317732425
1435. he knew it would	be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence.	19.68184271359002
1436. he was	right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier's	words on the subject well it seemed as good a place as any	to do the job.	10.914987209703858
1437. the gross group had been formed for the express	purpose of advising the secretary general.	10.321816766742582
1438. hammarskjold's supposed	desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross	is illusion at best.	9.974202494994882
1439. gross's being outside the un	applied only to a physical state not an objective one.	8.62963042412541
1440. but by the	time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the	world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that paul	bang-jensen was not of sound mind.	11.041098983709377
1441. shortly the group would issue	its report to the secretary general recommending paul bang-jensen's	dismissal from the united nations.	10.70861078002742
1442. the contents of this	195-page document would become known to many before it would become known	to the man it was written about.	10.264037074460147
1443. until this hungarian	committee matter came up bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual.	10.455582502391813
1444. i had known him for some years when i was a delegate and before	and this manner had never been his.	14.118256835028886
1445. ernest a gross	leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general	dag hammarskjold had on december 41957 called him in as a	private lawyer to review bang-jensen's conduct relating to his	association with the special committee on the problem of hungary.	7.2294359158313135
1446. the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman	with the assistance of two un under secretaries constantin	stavropoulos and philippe de seynes.	12.001624474833472
1447. yes gross	went on bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man.	11.750934696894943
1448. he had	always done well.	25.66056898750899
1449. never well known but he had done his work competently	h.	12.179121209524016
1450. gross had received marshall courteously and they	were discussing the case.	11.33819267263277
1451. you know the lawyer said it's	difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back.	13.751143820957116
1452. gross was behind a clean-top desk only a manila folder before	him.	10.957705180640192
1453. marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs.	17.11752771970273
1454. outside the	office windows twenty-four stories above wall street a light rain	was falling.	11.778169239828431
1455. mr gross your report says that 'our	function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate	from or prejudice mr bang-jensen's rights as a staff member'.	9.063484583987396
1456. you know bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged	his case.	17.69087225744933
1457. gross swung his swivel chair.	12.851133807717682
1458. well	how could that have been?	15.068811854765874
1459.  i don't consider that he was prejudged.	10.03458041728344
1460. we were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken	up by the disciplinary committee h.	12.074214317248444
1461. we have nothing	to hide under a bushel.	19.050355694520597
1462. we did our job mr stavropoulos and mr	de seynes and myself taking evidence from a number of people.	13.96523974375049
1463. what did you think about his mental state?	14.161254425534633
1464.    i	think our report sums up our finding gross answered.	11.793662721363662
1465. don't	forget here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost	a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report h.	10.096754240799548
1466. this was not merely alleging errors but was carried out	by day-after-day allegations in memos written charges of serious consequence	h.	13.348532904389495
1467. this is a distressing thing.	33.81596975902536
1468. supposing you or	i were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level	best to carry on our work.	10.269913686540715
1469. no organization can carry on like that.	13.673640231008864
1470. i've been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy	stories	about personnel difficulties so i know what a problem he was.	7.184013279402603
1471. what i'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled	at your committee.	11.285241485817174
1472. what do you mean?	46.347550398386836
1473. 	for instance regarding the fact that the gross committee issued	two interim announcements to the press during its investigation.	10.230359488184014
1474. you	know bang-jensen was told the committee was 'to convey its views	suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general'.	9.978131370206588
1475. in his	own words bang-jensen 'took it for granted that the group would	report to the secretary general privately and not in public'.	11.492680537142848
1476. he	claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial	to his position'.	11.322822388129964
1477. for an instant he	glared speechless at marshall.	18.33115768936607
1478. i thought	the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end.	16.711522414076146
1479. but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in	the press.	13.817896524414671
1480. it was getting so that we the committee were being tried.	21.602516692409893
1481. you can find it in the papers.	27.293025641584865
1482. well as a matter of	fact i've looked through back-issue files of new york papers for	december 1957 and haven't found a great deal-   gross	shot another look at marshall.	12.243380182715969
1483. it wasn't necessarily all here	in new york.	18.062441126441573
1484. don't forget the foreign press.	5.551295197217264
1485. then	what about the second interim public announcement?	11.118618003375188
1486.  this cited bang-jensen's	'aberrant conduct'.	23.72364129823438
1487. the reason for that	report was to settle the matter of the list.	16.950688883572276
1488. as far as i'm concerned	it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen's	conduct.	16.352151137279492
1489. the january fifteen report recommended that	bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers- in the presence	of a un security officer.	8.823603198795567
1490. how about your	press conference three days later- what was the reason for that?	15.686761662929925
1491. 	bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance	to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous.	7.811867791937725
1492. he claimed you made other slanderous allegations.	17.85990950921315
1493. gross paused	and repeated himself.	14.19641732877796
1494. the entire object of the press conference	was to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press were	querying the un about it.	12.672845155024472
1495. what was the list?	29.025471110328898
1496.  i don't know.	11.91500142666585
1497. bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that	he had in his possession.	8.62963042412541
1498. it was foolish of him to keep	them whatever they were.	19.93061036179638
1499. he could have been blackmailed or his family	might have been threatened.	17.266540616618418
1500. of course the matter caught the public's	attention.	25.892020522968846
1501. we attempted to conclude this and did so by having	the papers burned.	11.222934395151837
1502. hammerskjold didn't like the way it was	carried out.	16.779799824285707
1503. it was a sort of go^tterda^mmerung affair.	33.890144845970056
1504. hammarskjold	believes the un is an organization that settles matters	in a procedural way h.	11.539959576610379
1505. if hammarskjold	had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner and if	bang-jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it?	9.724412541414951
1506.    mr	gross concerning the formation of your committee there's the	fact that you have been a legal adviser to the un in the past;	as i understand it mr hammarskjold wanted outside advice.	11.607573798260196
1507. could you comment on that?	15.356272134268444
1508.    i've served as a counsel	for the un for some years specializing particularly in real	estate matters or other problems that the regular un legal	staff might not be equipped to handle.	7.867023541798135
1509. mr stavropoulos is the un	legal chief and a very good man but he is not fully versed on	some technical points of american law.	9.933527411247958
1510. what did you think	about bang-jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the	hungarian report?	12.767455589911721
1511.  marshall asked.	19.137741945722095
1512. why mick shann went over and over the report with alsing	andersen trying to check them out.	12.376028753280218
1513. even after the incident between	bang-jensen and shann in the delegates' lounge h and this	was not the way the chicago tribune presented it.	9.46167195825259
1514. gross	reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings.	11.33819267263277
1515. one	was an article on the un by alice widener from the cincinnati	enquirer.	9.070074471681158
1516. the other was by chesly manley in the chicago	daily tribune.	15.339809459006759
1517. gross pointed to the manley story.	13.027071110828437
1518. i	know ches he's a friend of mine.	13.037321475654965
1519. he probably didn't mean to write	it this way or maybe he did.	11.261230104526772
1520. there wasn't any 'violent argument'	between bang-jensen and shann as the tribune puts it.	12.99133546135848
1521. that	implies that shann was on the enemy side.	12.510389242280873
1522. you see what i mean?	24.542032597149603
1523. 	how it's phrased there- the word 'violent'.	11.118618003375188
1524. the	case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further	errors in the report.	11.922166546273694
1525. 'i've found errors and i want you to	look them over'.	9.669550099771405
1526. so once again shann had to argue with him about	this.	13.53774373592454
1527. but it wasn't a violent discussion.	25.715082089195334
1528. and after all this shann	went over all that bang-jensen had brought up.	14.256309388366912
1529. own report peter marshall reflected describes the encounter as	gross stopped briefly then went on.	8.62963042412541
1530. shann was responsible	for the report.	15.068811854765874
1531. he has felt terrible about all this.	18.339834222843848
1532. it was a good	report he did all he could to make it a good report.	22.4320094592231
1533. when i speak	of how shann felt i know well.	15.505544512655794
1534. don't forget i am an old member	of the club a former delegate.	6.064580716141531
1535. i think you are being unfair to take	these things up now.	17.884696842366107
1536. you know this hits in many areas.	22.96604301248965
1537. it	appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian	situation.	13.0072698558849
1538. don't forget the un did no more than the united	states did h it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to	get the impact of this fact.	10.336994328402616
1539. from the home	of his friend henrik kauffmann in washington dc paul	bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 1957 to ernest gross.	9.253320010246048
1540. it said in part:   h the matters to be considered are	obviously of a grave character and i therefore respectfully request	that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make	adequate preparation.	10.4415062318057
1541. ernest gross replied the next day	putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest.	9.070074471681158
1542. this reveals some	misunderstanding on your part.	18.474861091230572
1543. the group conducting the review is	not holding formal hearings.	14.258870204519855
1544. it wished to pursue in the course of this	review questions arising from the body of material already in its	possession h.	15.231518679389831
1545. it sounded like a fair enough invitation	peter marshall reflected and bang-jensen must have thought so too	because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth	floor of the un.	9.157761166180066
1546. there ernest gross further assured him:	we were requested by the secretary general as i understand	it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant	and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee	in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat.	9.61012533039714
1547. the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those	of common sense justice and fairness.	11.904851912290663
1548. peter marshall	noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with	the gross group as unfortunate experiences and after his second	meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings	without legal counsel.	8.529182783702717
1549. marshall pondered the reason for this and	pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group.	12.82451340392834
1550. j a c robertson after serving gross one week left	for england.	11.756891004663606
1551. fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged.	11.562355631565378
1552. another week passed	and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage.	12.264662920070139
1553. the sickness	was gone and after all the two young couples were on their honeymoon.	11.019432024686537
1554. the only lasting difficulty was the food.	19.68692713818544
1555. in spite of pickering	dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals the	food did not seem the same as at home.	11.956124215879587
1556. everything tasted differently	from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at	home i loathed the most here ann noted.	9.193362491025315
1557. at last they concluded	that the heavy full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise.	11.029305282934986
1558. walking was the remedy they decided but a deck full of chicken	coops and pigpens was hardly suitable.	9.681569530071313
1559. a rope was found and like children in school the missionaries	skipped for hours at a time.	9.18758731710668
1560. finally tiring of so monotonous a form	of exercise they decided to dance instead.	11.99352519773396
1561. it was much more fun reminding	the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics	room at bradford.	12.03405116833615
1562. the weather turned warmer and with it came better	appetites although harriet was still a little off-color.	13.642650297613951
1563. she could	not face coffee or tea without milk and was always craving types of	food that were not available aboard a sailing ship.	8.470772516201565
1564. by now she was sure	she was going to have a baby deciding it would be born in india	or burma that november.	13.687338203382946
1565. she was more excited than frightened at the	prospect of having her first child in a foreign land.	10.090743932797897
1566. the crew	of the caravan never failed to amaze ann who during her stay	in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language.	10.400310159460467
1567. she	wrote in her journal i have not heard the least profane language	since i have been on board the vessel.	9.132906796918196
1568. she was now enjoying the voyage very much.	17.935807260907062
1569. even the first wave	of homesickness had passed although there were moments when captain	heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she	felt a little twinge at her heart.	9.233725261370184
1570. as for adoniram she found him	to be the kindest of husbands.	15.719252674261535
1571. on sundays with the permission	of captain heard who usually attended with two of his officers	services were held in the double cabin.	11.680524724722842
1572. sometimes a ship would be	sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily	be seen on the distant deck.	10.406201091840591
1573. captain heard did not communicate with	any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united	states and britain.	12.393432212685022
1574. as warmer temperatures were encountered ann	and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt	water.	12.41249795947208
1575. when may came the caravan had already crossed	the equator.	13.166793761748654
1576. they were sailing round the cape of good hope; the	weather had turned wet and cold.	12.534523205700053
1577. at this time harriet wrote in a letter	which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother:	i care not how soon we reach calcutta and are placed	in a still room with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread.	8.734685257082967
1578. i	can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming oh what a luxury.	10.358652090748608
1579. i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel and	the almost intolerable smell after the rain that i have done little	more than lounge on the bed for several days.	9.21523095806414
1580. but i have been blest	with excellent spirits and to-day have been running about the deck	and dancing in our room for exercise as well as ever.	13.946803858665747
1581. while studying at the seminary in andover adoniram had been working	on a new testament translation from the original greek.	9.214137090423351
1582. he	had brought it along to continue during the voyage.	11.998877669207332
1583. there was one particular	word that troubled his conscience.	24.464789746876317
1584. this was the greek word most	often translated as baptism.	22.504697132290055
1585. born a congregationalist	he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having	a few drops of water sprinkled on his head yet nowhere in the whole of	the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized	by sprinkling.	8.260187489139474
1586. john the baptist used total immersion in the river	jordan for believers; even christ was baptized by this method.	9.986170227796956
1587. the more adoniram	looked at the greek word for baptism the more unhappy	he became over its true meaning.	9.878682659167447
1588. as was only natural he	confided his searchings to ann conceding ruefully that it certainly	looked as if their own	congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right.	10.635996995759028
1589. by this time she had learned that	it was futile to argue with her young husband yet the uncomfortable	fact remained: the american congregationalists were sending them as	missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries.	9.190081812837978
1590. what would	happen if adoniram changed horses in midstream?	15.928823468405662
1591.  baptists and	congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms.	11.29238663863889
1592. how embarrassing	it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries	should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist	teachings!   if you become a baptist i will not	ann informed her husband but sweeping her threat aside adoniram	continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he	found himself.	8.941850713648767
1593. by early june they were a hundred miles off the	coast of ceylon by which time all four missionaries were hardened	seafarers.	8.792918233615675
1594. even harriet could boldly write i know not how it is;	but i hear the thunder roll; see the lightning flash; and the	waves threatening to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved.	9.199895975128507
1595. ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two	strange tropical birds.	8.834168570742513
1596. land was near and on june 12 one hundred	and fourteen days after leaving america they actually saw twenty miles	away the coast of orissa.	9.003039901258845
1597. captain heard gave orders for	the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain	the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters.	7.40943446389984
1598. sometimes ships waited for days for such a man but captain	heard was lucky.	14.590344681535399
1599. next day a ship arrived with an english pilot	his leadsman an english youth and the first hindu the judsons and	newells had ever seen.	9.07525867583314
1600. a little man with a a dark copper color	skin he was wearing calico trousers and a white cotton short gown.	11.275742337930817
1601. ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance.	11.118618003375188
1602. he looks	as feminine as you can imagine she decided.	19.245415971233594
1603. the pilot possessed	excellent skill at his calling; all day long the caravan	slowly made her way through the difficult passages.	9.602950450953418
1604. alas to ann's	consternation his language while thus employed left much to be desired.	12.25618446796027
1605. he swore so loudly at the top of his voice that she didn't get	any sleep all the next night.	10.368056286296907
1606. next morning the caravan was	out of the treacherous bay.	13.718216021355506
1607. relieved of the major part of his responsibility	for the safety of the ship the pilot's oaths became fewer.	11.186388835742077
1608. slowly she moved up the hooghli river a mouth of the mighty ganges	toward calcutta.	11.399646290070931
1609. ann was entranced with the view as	were her husband and friends.	10.456349853816153
1610. running across the deck which was empty	now that the livestock had been killed and eaten they sniffed the spice-laden	breezes that came from the shore each pointing out new and	exciting wonders to the other.	9.19547050165397
1611. out came the journal and in it	went ann's own description of the scene:   on each side	of the hoogli where we are now sailing are the hindoo cottages as	thick together as the houses in our seaports.	8.85737964188517
1612. they are very small	and in the form of haystacks without either chimney or windows.	16.494161493015866
1613. they	are situated in the midst of trees which hang over them and appear	truly romantick.	12.2981362855254
1614. the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green and	herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river and	the natives are scattered about differently employed.	10.28161711768503
1615. some are fishing	some driving the team and many are sitting indolently on the banks	of the river.	10.252645121422768
1616. the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the	houses.	14.412550949795131
1617. harriet was just as delighted.	12.851133807717682
1618. where were the hardships	she had expected?	17.325641539754507
1619.  she was certain now that it would be no harder	to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home	in the big white house in haverhill.	11.19199011178975
1620. with childlike innocence she wrote	of the indians as walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands	with the tawny children around them h.	10.079502969888303
1621. this is the most delightful	trial i have ever had she decided.	22.007411749912418
1622. the indians	who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly	even if she was suitably shocked according to the customs of the society	in which she had been reared to find them naked except a piece	of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle.	9.877342762608137
1623. at last they	saw calcutta largest city of bengal and the caravan's destination.	12.647646010724415
1624. founded august 24 1690 by job charnock of the east india	company and commonly called the city of palaces it seemed	a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson.	9.738008716426934
1625. solid brick	buildings painted dazzling white large domes and tall picturesque palms	stretched as far as the eye could see while the wharves and harbor	were filled with tall-masted sailing ships.	8.340698321038664
1626. crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their	strange-sounding bengali tongue.	10.635267499930531
1627. harriet's mouth watered	with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last	to her much-craved milk and fresh bread.	8.142837001238597
1628. ann pleased to see her friend	happy was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard	had sent on board for their enjoyment.	9.436144246895733
1629. cautiously she sampled her first	pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of a	rich pear.	9.131637220087025
1630. though she did not then know its name this strange new	fruit was a banana.	12.2364234997455
1631. the first act of adoniram and samuel	on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station a necessity	when landing in east india company territory.	10.059899103325868
1632. on the way they	tried to discover all they could about burma and they were disturbed	to find that michael symes's book had not presented an altogether	true picture.	12.457332924356406
1633. he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really	treating him as the important visitor he considered himself.	14.42480348111412
1634. they	were in fact quietly laughing at him for their king wished to have	nothing to do with the western world.	11.539633609465154
1635. when captain john gibault	of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship the astra had been	promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river.	8.26987639153177
1636. although after much trouble he did manage to get it back he discovered	there was no trade to be had.	11.83652676280121
1637. all captain gibault took back	to salem were a few items for the town's east india museum.	10.237601717019452
1638. a	year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum	lacquer which nobody wanted to buy.	10.462039855076602
1639. after that salem ships decided	to bypass unfriendly burma.	14.556179955937138
1640. the burmese appeared to have little	knowledge of british power or any idea of trade.	12.343669198529348
1641. cruel burmese governors could on the slightest whim take	a man's life.	9.596130553233781
1642. as for missionaries even if they succeeded in getting	into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the	christian faith to the burmans.	14.395237302909738
1643. unspeakable tortures or even execution	might well be their fate.	10.057988591011652
1644. go back to america or any	other place well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them	but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads.	10.106612144725647
1645. somewhat	daunted the two american missionaries reached the police station	where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk.	8.1523940120599
1646. when he discovered	they had received from the company's court of directors	no permission to live in india coupled with the fact that they were	americans who had been sent to asia to convert the heathen he	became more belligerent than ever.	12.877880460586146
1647. they explained that they	desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could	be found.	9.225233536394942
1648. she describes first the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by	this unseasonable exultation; he is answered by a confused	honest englishman.	10.251810966895608
1649. the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are	found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government	their delight at the prospect of a new war their hopes of having the	tories hanged and so on.	9.839664807516565
1650. as for the author of the englishman	mrs manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the	protestant cause should be left to ridpath dick steele and	their associates with the apostles of young man's coffee-house.	11.538011803427747
1651. another controversy typical of the war between the	englishman and the examiner centered on robert	molesworth a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish	privy council.	11.471039331495785
1652. on december 21 the day that the irish house	of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps their	tory lord chancellor molesworth reportedly made this remark on the	defense of phipps by convocation: they that have turned the	world upside down are come hither also.	8.778864121656632
1653. upon complaints from the	lower house of convocation to the house of lords he was removed	from the privy council his remark having been represented as a blasphemous	affront to the clergy.	8.820414471623874
1654. steele who had earlier praised molesworth	in tatler no 189 now defended him in englishman	no 46 depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution.	8.777324869432913
1655. on	the other hand molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press.	14.322014582471022
1656. swift in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum's	introduction indicated his feelings by including molesworth	along with toland tindal and collins in the group of those	who like burnet are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy.	8.966752207090005
1657. in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter	to archbishop king and he had earlier described him as the worst	of them in some observations on the irish privy council	submitted to oxford.	10.124639493865347
1658. a month later in the publick spirit of	the whigs he used steele's defense of molesworth as evidence of	his disrespect for the clergy calling steele's position an affront	to the whole convocation of ireland.	9.430960484391248
1659. on this issue then	as on so many in these months steele and swift took rigidly opposed	points of view.	10.885552181247874
1660. in the early months of 1714 the battle	between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its	major phase.	14.768572495877649
1661. the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele's	crisis on january 19 and from that point on the fight proceeded	at a rapid pace.	9.720517230018414
1662. in answer to the crisis swift produced	the publick spirit of the whigs his most extensive and bitter	attack on his old friend.	14.156928783631592
1663. by this time as we shall see the tories	were already planning to punish steele for his political writing	by expelling him from the house of commons.	12.816324088437698
1664. despite his defense	of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech	before the house their efforts were successful.	12.04032726980229
1665. steele lost his	seat in parliament and his personal quarrel with swift by now a public	issue thus reached its climax.	7.9139724503302755
1666. of all the whig tracts	written in support of the succession the crisis is perhaps the	most significant.	16.90255195904177
1667. certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate.	21.457305519667912
1668. hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation said to have reached	40000 and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other	government writers the work must have had considerable impact.	9.876500557153014
1669. steele's	main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate	danger of a stuart restoration.	8.94242336172165
1670. to this end the first and longest	section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution	to defend england against the arbitrary power of a popish prince.	10.228124790999978
1671. in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes	of current whig propaganda ranging from a criticism of the tory	peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough; but his principal	theme is that the intrigues of the tories our popish or jacobite	party pose an immediate threat to church and state.	7.769603983825712
1672. like	burnet he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the	crisis.	21.443280189923723
1673. treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession	he complains are allowed to pass unnoticed.	9.953459621299555
1674. in this connection swift	too is drawn in for attack: the author of the conduct of	the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession.	13.693106155501189
1675. in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy steele	goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected	in the event of a stuart restoration and with rousing rhetoric he	asserts that the only preservation from these terrours is to	be	found in the laws he has so tediously cited.	8.631315446046868
1676. it is no time he	writes to talk with hints and innuendos but openly and honestly	to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put	their designs in execution against us.	12.117429991082064
1677. steele apparently	professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his	own good since the government was soon to use it as evidence against	him in his trial before the house.	8.537633601141389
1678. in the final issues of the englishman	which ended just as the new session of parliament began	he provided his enemies with still more ammunition.	13.318096652949274
1679. for example no	56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke	of cambridge.	12.75389875141666
1680. in a few months the duke was to be the center of	a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant	succession.	16.30994112123841
1681. at the order of the dowager electress the hanoverian	agents supported by the whig leaders demanded that a writ	of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in	parliament thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian	prince in england before the queen's death.	8.367704260408358
1682. anne was	furious and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused.	11.33819267263277
1683. oxford	realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ took the opposite	view for which the queen never forgave him.	9.074621609375802
1684. accordingly the	request was granted but the elector himself who had not been consulted	by his mother rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schu^tz	whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian	interest to suffer and had made oxford's dismissal more likely	than ever.	8.694854794771059
1685. steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a	plan.	9.345058977386529
1686. a few days after this englishman appeared defoe reported	to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the	duke be called over; defoe then commented if they could draw	that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves	quickly for they are not asham'd to say they want onely a head	to make a beginning.	10.085073674769788
1687. the final issue of the englishman	no 57 for february 15 ran to some length and was printed	as a separate pamphlet entitled the englishman: being the close	of the paper so-called.	8.268499196883758
1688. steele's purpose is to present a general	defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which	had occupied him in the englishman; but there is much here also	which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift.	9.987668878321658
1689. thus he complains	with considerable justice that the tory writers have resorted	to libel instead of answering his arguments.	9.406141436645859
1690. his birth education	and fortune he says have all been ridiculed simply because he has	spoken with the freedom of an englishman and he assures the reader that	whoever talks with me is speaking to a gentleman born.	9.322451607989258
1691. as	notable examples of this abuse he quotes passages from the examiner	that destroyer of all things and the character of richard	steele which he here attributes to swift.	8.696926634682073
1692. though put in rather	maudlin terms steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis.	12.036949411649541
1693. his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal	satire despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right	to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of	the sovereign.	9.550987174438617
1694. he claims too that his political convictions are simply	those which are called revolution principles and which are	accepted by moderate men in both parties.	10.073233219714423
1695. the final section	of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele's	relations with swift.	10.626909339244458
1696. it purports to be a letter from steele to	a friend at court who in miss blanchard's opinion could only be	meant as swift.	12.488382367730573
1697. steele first answers briefly the charges which his	dear old friend has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and	his	crisis.	8.026882005052693
1698. then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers	whom he calls the new converts; by this term he means to ridicule	their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite	their own education and manner of life- a gibe in other words	at the presbyterianism in harley's family and at bolingbroke's	reputed impiety.	10.143334686643536
1699. the tory leaders he insinuates are cynically	using the church as a political by-word to increase party friction	and keep themselves in power.	8.847019011814016
1700. this is the principal point made	in this final section of englishman no 57 and it caps steele's	efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the	notion of the tories as a church party supported by the body	of the clergy.	10.793256419918496
1701. next steele turns his attention to the courtier	he is addressing.	12.781169994050337
1702. he explains that there are sometimes honorable	courtiers but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not	hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice	and ambition.	11.625338325060918
1703. such he implies is the case with his friend who is not	really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts.	8.56981304647385
1704. if jack the courtier is really to be taken as swift the following	remark is obviously steele's comment on swift's change of	parties and its effect on their friendship: i assure you dear	jack when i first found out such an allay in you as makes you	of so malleable a constitution that you may be worked into any form	an artificer pleases i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much	longer.	8.63337911011424
1705. he closes his letter by demanding that dunkirk	be demolished that the pretender be forced to move farther away from	the coast of england and that the queen and the house of hanover	come to a better understanding.	9.15927838235143
1706. the last point was soon to be included	in the seditious remarks used against him in parliament.	12.317920082394153
1707. the examiner during steele's trial a month later printed	an answer from the courtier addressed to r s at	button's coffee-house.	8.986929434215044
1708. he reviews steele's entrance into politics	and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing	to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly	should be credited to the indulgence of his friends.	8.923949028616828
1709. once more	in other words steele is said to be indebted to swift for his wit;	this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared	in the tory press especially the examiner.	8.651560340517062
1710. in the publick	spirit of the whigs it may be noted swift himself contemptuously	dismissed steele's reference to his friend at court: i	suppose by the style of old friend and the like it must be some	body there of his own level; among whom his party have indeed	more friends than i could wish.	0.0
1711. on february 16	steele took his seat in parliament.	14.278231204919473
1712. by now he was undergoing a fresh	torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets and action was being	taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament.	9.217793437357832
1713. on the	very day that the parliamentary session began another infamous	libel appeared entitled a letter from the facetious dr	andrew tripe at bath to the venerable nestor ironside.	9.043557410262625
1714. it is	filled with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of his physical	appearance; in the opening paragraph too steele is accused	of extreme egotism of giving himself the preference to all the learned	his contemporaries from dr sw-ft himself even down to	poet cr-spe of the customhouse.	9.458614585957449
1715. when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 it	was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer begun some	years before.	9.41462132134396
1716. the film they did after his return was an inconsequential	bit of nothing titled out of this world a satire on the sinatra	bobby-soxer craze.	11.129685350152029
1717. the twist lay in using bing crosby's voice	on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the	words.	9.170825868540605
1718. if nothing else at least two good songs came out of the project	out of this world and june comes around every year.	14.490209290558065
1719. though they would produce some very memorable and lasting	songs arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on.	9.031204143964315
1720. their first collaboration came close.	17.008215029924806
1721. early in 1941 they were assigned	to a script titled hot nocturne.	12.333924944525894
1722. it purported to be a reasonably	serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians their aims their	problems- the tug-of-war between the pure and the commercial-	and seemed a promising vehicle for the two men shared a	common interest in jazz.	10.5229410704679
1723. johnny mercer practically grew up with	the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears.	8.8806828014983
1724. he was born in savannah	georgia in 1909.	30.252871709657555
1725. his father george a mercer was descended	from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back	to one hugh mercer who had emigrated from scotland in 1747.	8.013243534619821
1726. the lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into	real estate.	12.445450562798397
1727. his second wife lillian was the mother of john h	mercer.	12.642883188406467
1728. by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the	call.	18.937832469168438
1729. one day he followed the irish jasper greens the town band	to a picnic and spent the entire day listening while his family spent	the day looking.	9.248349786093058
1730. the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time	maid to keeping an eye on the boy.	12.493413505323888
1731. but one afternoon mrs	mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the mercer home.	17.17685349259754
1732. the mother inquired where's johnny and why did you leave him?	15.734829670519668
1733. 	there was nothing else i could do the maid answered	satisfied with a rather vague explanation.	9.341247069575262
1734. but mrs mercer demanded	more.	27.15951357783852
1735. the maid then told her because he fired me.	12.204673387645432
1736. with	her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little	else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited	until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with	the trumpet.	9.17588002934739
1737. young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for	both instruments.	10.491641879974775
1738. still he did like music making and even sang in	the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school near orange virginia	where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well.	9.210509164727869
1739. when he was fifteen john h mercer turned out his first song a	jazzy little thing he called sister susie strut your	stuff.	10.950379113048113
1740. if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have	been mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with	a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect.	11.810251586216438
1741. from his playmates in savannah	mercer had picked up along with a soft southern dialect traces	also of the gullah dialects of africa.	10.474255481295469
1742. such speech differences	made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language.	14.465656392544457
1743. during the summers while he was still in school mercer worked	for his father's firm as a messenger boy.	13.795982626827257
1744. it generally took well	into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help.	13.122791283333418
1745. we'd	give him things to deliver letters checks deeds and things	like that remembers his half-brother walter still in the real estate	business in savannah and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly	stuffed them into his pocket.	7.459485677076105
1746. this rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed	to be the dominant trait in mercer's personality ever since.	10.706200255335153
1747. it	is however a disarming disguise or perhaps a shield for not only has	mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the	years but also one who can function remarkably under pressure.	9.65087918640224
1748. he	has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer	and is a sharp businessman.	10.451409202007968
1749. he has also	an extraordinary conscience.	23.691078986947513
1750. in 1927 his father's business collapsed	and rather than go bankrupt mercer senior turned his firm over	to a bank for liquidation.	11.28437421553113
1751. he died before he could completely pay off	his debts.	16.22656585503086
1752. some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation	received a check for $300000 enough to clear up the debt.	11.73978903189226
1753. the check	had been mailed from chicago the envelope bore no return address	and the check was not signed.	9.189554574368655
1754. that's johnny sighed	the bank president the best-hearted boy in the world but absent-minded.	9.213480087530998
1755. but mercer's explanation was simple: i made out	the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case i lost	it.	9.822977540614902
1756. when he remembered that he might have not signed the check	mercer made out another for the same amount instructing the bank to	destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly	signed both of them.	12.419051535768771
1757. when the family business failed mercer	left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he	would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group.	9.313520097071628
1758. when	the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition-	and won- mercer instead of returning with the rest of	the company in triumph remained in new york.	10.848153215645908
1759. he had talked one other	member of the group to stay with him but that friend had tired of	not eating regularly and returned to savannah.	10.274484695392983
1760. but mercer hung on	living after a fashion in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up.	13.419802783551885
1761. the place had no sink or washbasin only a bathtub his mother	discovered when she visited him.	10.29673139374029
1762. johnny insisted on cooking a	chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and i'll	never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub.	8.987765087670182
1763. a story	no doubt apocryphal for mercer himself denies it has him sporting	a monacle in those village days.	8.988146053999083
1764. though merely clear glass it	was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint	himself upon the memories of producers.	9.87538419763775
1765. one day in a bar so the legend	goes someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle	and broke it.	10.132370095830385
1766. the innocent malfeasant filled with that supreme sense	of honor found in bars insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle-	and did over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle.	9.58430515920913
1767. mercer is supposed to have refused it with anyone who wears	a square monacle must be affected!   everett miller then	assistant director for the garrick gaieties a theatre guild	production needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just	happened not to need any actor at the moment however.	7.722434708122203
1768. for him mercer	produced the lyric to out of breath scared to death of you	introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties by sterling	holloway.	11.675794259923471
1769. this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke	and ira gershwin by e y harburg and duke and by harry	myers.	8.51373500565124
1770. entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged	the burgeoning song writer to take a wife elizabeth meehan a dancer	in the gaieties.	9.629618366157581
1771. the mercers took up residence in brooklyn	and mercer found a regular job in wall street misplacing stocks	and bonds.	9.398385010169328
1772. when he heard that paul whiteman was looking	for singers to replace the rhythm boys mercer applied and got the	job not for my voice i'm sure but because i could write songs	and material generally.	10.462757310240901
1773. while with the whiteman band mercer met	jerry arlen.	12.06058656973963
1774. he had yet to meet harold arlen for although they	had collaborated on satan's li'l lamb mercer and	harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them.	10.173071864875359
1775. the lyric mercer remembers was tailored to fit the unusual melody.	12.009648630241193
1776. mercer's whiteman association brought him into contact	with	hoagy carmichael whose snowball mercer relyriced as lazybones	in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning	of mercer's song-writing career.	8.729826687715507
1777. after leaving whiteman mercer	joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist.	11.351983689664939
1778. with the help of ziggy	elman also in the band he transformed a traditional jewish melody	into a popular song and the angels sing.	13.620394876597802

1783.  and too marvelous	for words; with harry warren he	did the girl friend of the whirling dervish jeepers creepers	and you must have been a beautiful baby.	9.662684540389934
1784. mercer's	lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances	a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair.	9.797031043428824
1785. though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with	the best of them mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit.	8.422023245736202
1786. his casual dreamlike working methods often as not in absentia	were an abrupt change from harburg's so that arlen had	to adjust again to another approach to collaboration.	11.523159460655194

1801. the americanegro suite is in a sense	an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection	of negro songs not for a night club but for the concert stage.	12.098697928445656
1802. the	work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which	koehler set the words there'll be no more work there'll	be no	more worry matching the spiritual feeling of the jot.	9.269507737404128

1805. the negro composer hall johnson studied	the americanegro suite and said of it of all the many	songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid	idiom in both words and music these six songs by harold arlen	and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest.	7.571514333829013
1806. thoroughly	modern in treatment they are at the same time full of simple sincerity	which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by	no means to be confused with the average 'broadway spirituals'	which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'amen	corner' 'judgement day' 'gabriel's horn' and a	frustrated devil- with a few random 'hallelujahs' thrown in for	good measure.	9.237007159872991

1810. a much larger room adjacent to the	lavatory served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet.	13.373908937381742
1811. that	unused room was large enough for- well say an elephant could get	into it h and as a matter of fact an elephant did h   something	occurred on the morning of the children's party which may	illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused	us.	9.140567624951325

1828. mr herford	touched the fat man's arm.	17.161904634791167

1839. the hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage	rider of the steppes.	10.242653103537407
1840. indeed he looked more like a well-fleshed	lay brother of the hospice of st bernard.	12.127436032801562
1841. nor were his manners	barbaric.	18.774249134524496
1842. he had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features	which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the	bodies were buried.	12.517644742954015

1846. it was said that	the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire	one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who	tried to halt his course the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes	of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr hearst.	10.699421793795844

1850. runyon for his part had a contemptuous	regard for mr watson.	13.62560347040328

1856. why'?	28.49691246350829
1857.    about the only time the hetman seemed excited	was	when one of his own pet ideas was born.	12.5432016548764
1858. then he would get to his feet	as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers and say almost	invariably gentlemen this is an amazing story! it's bigger	than the armistice.	11.053533783060056
1859. some of the hetman's ideas	were dream-ridden vaguely imparted and at times preposterous.	17.473213793091194

1861. he said that his information was so secret that he would	not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.	12.453158522500981
1862. i	can tell you this much he said.	13.037321475654965
1863. it's bigger than the armistice.	4.885278637533141
1864. i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment	and consulted several of my own well-informed sources.	13.288405051897014

1866. when i returned to make my report the hetman did not remember	having sent me on the secret mission.	13.666185729827268
1867. he was busy he said in	having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation.	13.007653467252661
1868. and i was to go	to work on that odd matter.	18.79200144316055
1869. i shall tell of it later on.	16.452614186234445
1870. the	hetman had a strong liking for a story any story which was to be had	by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods.	9.62671391522353
1871. most of my stories	were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me	the facts and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.	11.345616263357304
1872. one day	i tired of following the hetman's advice of shadowing and	of the ring-around-the-rosie approach to a report that enrico caruso	had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the central park monkey	house.	9.77397659538634

1876. mr	baer had an auburn beard like longfellow's.	13.037321475654965
1877. mr mccay had on	a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache.	10.74730553741912
1878. as for myself i	had on an enormous black muff.	17.884243284780368
1879. this together with a derby hat	and horn-rim eyeglasses gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist.	11.121166615130234
1880. we are ready for your next mysterious assignment said	mr baer to the hetman.	14.817236582722497
1881. where to sir?	22.06834791196731
1882.    mr watson	did not have much humor in his make-up but he managed a mirthless	smile.	11.64450889703335
1883. just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give	the rewrite desk an account of a murder.	10.22258209070722
1884. the hetman told me to take	the story over the phone and to write it.	11.636095537390238
1885. while i was sitting at one	of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard arthur	brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand.	8.014643972423169
1886. he paused	for a moment to look at me then went on to the city desk to deliver	his today column.	16.605215815686066
1887. i thought it expedient to take off my	derby my glasses and the beard; and also to change telephones.	11.633280612426832
1888. i	managed to do this by the time the great ab returned to the place	where he last had seen the fierce nihilist.	13.027888072297365
1889. he stood there staring	with disbelief at the vacant desk.	13.12721662888421
1890. then he wrinkled his huge brow	and went slowly out of the room.	15.879558033093536
1891. he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression.	25.872962566074854
1892. he had been seeing things.	34.241034402288484
1893. the hetman's	ideas	for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless	or lacking in merit.	10.31682619585392
1894. he campaigned successfully for the riddance	of death avenue and also brought about the ending of pollution	of metropolitan beaches by sewage.	10.581383043688653
1895. he exposed the bucket-shop racket	with the able assistance of two excellent reporters nat ferber	and carl helm.	9.860007737575463
1896. in the conduct of these and many other campaigns the	hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.	16.75161885768838
1897. it seems to me now in a long backward glance that many of	the hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture	when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr hearst- were	keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day.	10.130351868472687
1898. alone	rejected on every hand divorced and in financial trouble he leaped	from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937.	9.159936216703418
1899. one	finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited	for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol wr	hearst.	8.00098170566443
1900. that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure	of his despair.	13.49461171303154
1901. the unfinished note written in pencil upon the back	of a used envelope and addressed to the coroner makes one wonder	about many things: god forgive me for everything.	8.161315419669146
1902. i cannot	h   much to damon runyon's amazement as well as my own	i got along splendidly with the hetman; that is until i became	an editor hence in his eyes a rival.	10.469458061677807
1903. not long after colonel van	hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise	and a contract on the hetman's recommendation.	10.117806319720106
1904. during the next years	he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the	hearst service.	13.702870095524004
1905. it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to	have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists.	14.683489113816613
1906. i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement.	25.41971056825032
1907. somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he	otherwise might have because his foe colonel van hamm wouldn't	touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.	8.305183888245793
1908. i remember one day when	mr hearst sent the	hetman a telegram: please find some more reporters like that	young man from denver.	10.832843493538626
1909. watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm.	11.820571849892875
1910. the colonel grunted then made a remark which might be construed	in either of two ways.	11.794219595011763
1911. don't bother to look any further.	5.188506696380168

1914. sergeant	mike donaldson congressional medal of honor soldier was	one of them.	11.33819267263277
1915. dr menas s gregory was another.	14.12900994243485
1916. i used to go	with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment to sit	among the doctor's excellent collection of statues paintings and	books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and	become almost affable.	9.505929135029087
1917. there was one time however when his	face clouded and he suddenly blurted why did my brother commit	suicide?	13.196862296907387
1918.    i cannot remember dr gregory's reply if	indeed he made one.	16.085711753369967

1920. sometimes mrs coolidge would close herself in the	green suite on the second floor and play the piano she had brought	to the white house.	10.107737926517757
1921. mama knew she was playing her son's favorite	pieces and feeling close to him and did not disturb her.	9.901834706304768
1922. all	the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic	loss even though the president tried harder than ever to make his	little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.	11.051327542157043
1923. a little	boy came to give the president his personal condolences and the president	gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be	shown in.	8.551867333596272
1924. backstairs the maids cried a little over that and the standing	invitation was not mentioned to mrs coolidge.	10.383321387600216
1925. the	president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been	before the tragedy.	10.69287608253421
1926. he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents	to coax a smile to her lips.	12.922762851446725
1927. dresses	were short in the days of mrs coolidge and spanish shawls	were thrown over them.	10.440050229493433
1928. he got her dozens of them.	22.673195474514653
1929. one shawl was so	tremendous that she could not wear it so she draped it over the banister	on the second floor and it hung over the stairway.	9.252313796891507
1930. the president	used to look at it with a ghost of a smile.	19.46973419779976
1931. mrs coolidge	spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection.	10.310022733497597
1932. she kept	the dolls on the lincoln bed.	16.668520126952053
1933. at night when mama would turn back the	covers she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place	them elsewhere for the night.	10.523019774624021
1934. mama always felt that the collection symbolized	mrs coolidge's wish for a little girl.	11.565949405986661
1935. among the	dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady who would pick	it up and look at it often.	13.314404687592022
1936. it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist.	22.025093327954714

1940. the coolidges' life after the death of their	son was quieter than ever.	15.309819347447611
1941. john was away at school most of the time.	13.13412923170253
1942. mrs coolidge would knit and the president would sit reading	or playing with the many pets around them.	11.159911020346366
1943. now and then the	president would call for little jack master of the hounds	which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house	since teddy roosevelt's administration and discuss the welfare	of some one of the animals.	8.834636614550845
1944. it was part of little jack's work	to look after the dogs.	20.102405387680335
1945. one white house dog was immortalized	in a painting.	13.876685311351954
1946. that was rob roy who posed with mrs coolidge	for the portrait by howard chandler christy.	12.935291881764192
1947. to get him to pose	mrs coolidge would feed him candy so he enjoyed the portrait sessions	as well as she did.	10.226856065376374
1948. i would like to straighten out a misconception	about the dress mrs coolidge is wearing in this painting.	15.747243249980205
1949. it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian.	20.462804067914007
1950. people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist	much later on.	13.039179288206304
1951. the dress in the painting is a	bright red with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side.	10.176820753101309
1952. there	is a long train flowing from the shoulders.	16.48431181467826
1953. mrs coolidge	gave mama this dress for me and i wore it many times.	10.257647769066356
1954. i still have	the dress and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution	as a memento or as i more fondly hope to present it to a museum containing	articles showing the daily lives of the presidents- if i	can get it organized.	9.933748230912068
1955. but to get back to the coolidge household	mrs coolidge so obviously loved dogs that the public sent her	more dogs- calamity jane timmy and blackberry.	10.954034375374771
1956. the last two	were a red and a black chow.	16.968858152176026
1957. rob roy remained boss of all the dogs.	12.322563543575153
1958. he showed them what to do and taught them how to keep the maids around	the white house in a state of terror.	15.625311692464383
1959. the dogs would run	through the halls after him like a burst of bullets and all the maids	would run for cover.	10.478038285910005
1960. mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell	on rob roy or not- since she had the ear of mrs coolidge	more than the other maids.	9.410005368769095
1961. but she was afraid the first lady would	not understand because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first	family.	10.707863709940785
1962. every day when the president took his nap rob roy	would stretch out on the window seat near him like a perfect gentleman	and stare thoughtfully out the window or he would take a little	nap himself.	9.418683340165583
1963. he would not make a sound until the president had wakened	and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know	the coast was clear.	10.63127160462585
1964. his signal was for the other dogs to come running	but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch	out.	10.766022245112374
1965. rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to	his office every morning.	9.070074471681158
1966. rob roy was well aware of the importance	of this mission and he would walk in front of the president looking	neither to the right nor to the left.	14.857433590674825
1967. at dinner lunch or breakfast	the president would call out supper!- he called	all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal.	8.96246550495147
1968. all the	dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to	the dining room.	14.061816169305898
1969. they would all lie around on the rug during the meal	a very pretty sight as rob roy prudence and calamity jane were	all snow-white.	9.86375215717425
1970. when prudence and blackberry were too young	to be trusted in the dining room they were tied to the radiator with	their leashes and they would cry.	11.757841151156823
1971. mama tried to talk to them and keep	them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first	family returned.	9.132400968628659
1972. finally mama did mention to mrs coolidge	that she felt sorry for the little dogs and then mrs coolidge	decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone even though	her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.	9.031492276033884
1973. mama was	now the first maid to mrs coolidge because catherine the previous	first maid had become ill and died.	8.026882005052693
1974. mrs coolidge chose mama	in her place.	16.125215419227484
1975. it was a high mark for mama.	26.67374353107614
1976. every first	family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship.	15.376647551315632
1977. for the coolidges it was mr and mrs frank w stearns	of boston massachusetts owners of a large department store.	11.188417282460422
1978. they	seemed to be at the white house half the time.	19.721263674765787
1979. the butlers were	amused because when the stearns were there the president would say	grace at breakfast.	10.592450301864938
1980. if the stearns were not there grace would be omitted.	17.34818141272823
1981. speaking of breakfast the president inaugurated a new	custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table.	10.332866579601815
1982. the word	was that this too was part of an economy move on his part.	12.954782138026662
1983. a new bill	had been passed under harding that designated the government rather	than the president as the tab-lifter for official meals.	9.055607676747023
1984. so the	president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government	officials to attend.	11.987180207221053
1985. he caused a lot of talk when he also	chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair	while he ate.	10.175435910180909
1986. mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful	mr coolidge certainly made a good president.	11.557917784793489
1987. he knew exactly	how to be colorful!   the favorite guest of the house as	far as the staff was concerned was mr wrigley the chewing gum king.	10.019074828169511
1988. the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more and	every christmas mr wrigley sent the president a check for $100	to be divided among all the help.	10.772034103517688
1989. you can imagine that he got pretty	good service.	19.610478525339758
1990. another good friend of the coolidges' was	george b harvey who was the ambassador to great britain from	1921 to 1923.	10.582046411643937
1991. he had been a friend of the hardings and continued	to be invited by the coolidges.	14.114141040143574
1992. the first royalty whom mama	ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania	who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 1926.	13.222866695434217
1993. she was not an overnight guest in the white house but mr ike	hoover the chief usher had mama check her fur coat when she came	in and take care of her needs.	10.662389478763734
1994. mama said she was one of the prettiest	ladies she had ever seen.	15.9362493762059
1995. mama was very patriotic and one of	the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that	flew above the white house.	8.889885771961533
1996. actually two flags were used at the	mansion- a small one on rainy days and a big one on bright days.	10.871471195257207
1997. the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind	and mama would mend it.	9.189554574368655
1998. she would often go up on the roof to see	the attendant take down the flag in the evening.	12.829298812088966
1999. she used to tell me	when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that	way i have the wonderful safe feeling that americans are protected	no matter which way the wind blows.	9.021691264223989
2000. even when mrs	coolidge was in mourning for her son she reached out to help other people	in trouble.	12.448084132029841
2001. one person she helped was my brother.	16.07650241675611
2002. mama had told	her how emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the	war.	11.154307638416261
2003. he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number	of times.	17.514335383040496
2004. taking a personal interest she had the doctor	assigned to the white house dr james coupal look emmett over.	11.975067785165432
2005. as a result he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health	improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the	government service.	12.347791223115713
2006. but again there was danger that his lungs would	suffer in the muggy washington weather and he had to return to the	dry climate of the west to live and work.	14.62882970106463
2007. when mrs coolidge	was in mourning she did not wear black.	13.21101033822782
2008. she wore grey every day	and white every evening.	19.622927647548522
2009. mama knew that she was out of mourning when	she finally wore bright colors.	11.39772961915152
2010. the president helped her a lot by selecting	some lovely colored dresses to get her started.	13.4102068390668
2011. she opened the	boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face.	9.492640636434544
2012. on	the social side the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the	white house thrilled her the most.	0.0
2013. it was her job to stand at the	foot of the stairs and just as the first lady stepped off the last	tread mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to	the blue room to greet her guests with the president.	9.536376392821479
2014. mama would	enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone and would note	a gown here and there to tell me about that night.	11.470944721622109
2015. one night	mama came home practically in a state of shock.	14.947930081158255
2016. she had stood at the	bottom of the stairs as usual when mrs coolidge came down in	the same dress that is now in the smithsonian to greet her guests.	10.707728230544856
2017. mama stooped down to fix the train but there was no train there! she	reached and reached around the dress but there was nothing there.	9.995837094929742
2018. she looked up and saw that without knowing it mrs coolidge was	holding it aloft.	12.19382524070114
2019. mrs coolidge looked down saw mama's horrified	expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor.	9.20556974659308
2020. mama	swirled the train in place and not a step was lost.	12.869805905957813
2021. the coolidges	did not always live at the white house during the presidency.	13.236282074577105
2022. impressive as this enumeration is it barely hints at the diverse	perceptions of jews collectively or individually that have been	attested by their gentile environment.	8.860944413918231
2023. it is reasonable to affirm	two propositions: jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things	to all men; some jews have in fact been all things to all men.	9.520180383645625
2024. in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody's	ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been	someone's enemy.	13.131855704531944
2025. in the market place jews have in fact under various	circumstances been valued customers and suppliers or clannish monopolists	and cutthroat competitors.	11.391499583590127
2026. and so on through the roles referred	to in the previous paragraph.	0.0
2027. diversity of perception yes; diversity	of fact yes.	11.118618003375188
2028. but the two do not invariably or even	typically coincide.	18.29952855112787
2029. the conventional image of a particular time	and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as	established over the years by scholarly and scientific research.	11.661724051271445
2030. conventional	images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of	a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be	both true and false.	9.540570909812432
2031. the genuinely interesting question then	becomes: what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion	in conventional images of jews?	9.794120749425755
2032.  the working test of the facts	must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars	and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation	to relevant situations.	10.089625932131222
2033. granted such functional images are subject	to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they	are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against	error.	9.46143476615998
2034. in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors	can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions	regarding intelligence.	12.926445785331156
2035. general grant may have been the victim	of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so	he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed	to bad information and dubious estimates of the future.	8.613668109696762
2036. but general	grant may have been self-victimized.	24.351763663856342
2037. he may have entered the situation	with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the	press of affairs.	11.680197241145525
2038. predispositions in turn fall conveniently	into two categories for purposes of analysis.	10.957705180640192
2039. to some extent predispositions	are shaped by exposure to group environments.	13.852310841101138
2040. in some measure	they depend upon the structure of individual personality.	19.60058864015781
2041. the anti-semitism	of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of	lueger's politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna.	9.193648379736588
2042. but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger's propaganda	and record.	14.226867914495054
2043. after allowing for group exposures it is apparent	that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism.	10.976319013232885
2044. these are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts	within the whole man and mechanisms whereby inner components are	more or less smoothly met.	10.195876024295437
2045. modern psychiatric knowledge provides us	with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.	10.279379573124546
2046. the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual	images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or	fall short of it.	9.725942325839862
2047. undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile	conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that	it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination	in terms of reality.	8.143426793487734
2048. many selections are themselves convincing	contributions to this appraisal.	15.003179019087538
2049. undoubtedly however the significance	of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest.	10.353948238479
2050. speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is	in the realm of future policy.	13.334607223562967
2051. since we can neither undo nor redo the	past we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow.	11.55513244158896
2052. in this	domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local national and	world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having	some effect large or small upon gentile-jewish relations.	10.276770013449559
2053. what	shall these effects be?	14.19641732877796
2054.    i am deliberately raising the policy	problems involved in gentile-jewish relations.	16.75575887611948
2055. comprehensive examination	of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual	tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method.	9.296876526093957
2056. the tasks	are briefly indicated by these questions: what are my goals in gentile-jewish	relations?	12.010194183656237
2057.  what are the historical trends in this country	and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized?	11.854905706284326
2058. 	what factors condition the degree of realization at various	times and places?	12.406630128670246
2059.  what is the probable course of future developments?	20.16896080255446
2060. 	what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will	increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired	events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values?	9.14223364994142
2061. 	it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions	of such depth and range.	8.666718734744567
2062. the discussion is therefore limited to a	suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance	of this volume for future policy.	10.909160933005133
2063. as a groundwork for the proposal	i give some attention to the first task enumerated above the clarification	of goal.	12.410631656240543
2064. my reply is that i associate myself with	all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute	to the theory and practice of human dignity.	9.270500861711284
2065. the basic goal finds partial	expression in the universal declaration of human rights a statement	initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many	religious and philosophical traditions.	8.500823240940065
2066. within this frame of	reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the	jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved as well as upon	the nature of the claim the characteristics of the claimant the justifications	proposed and the predispositions of the community decision	makers who are called upon to act.	10.13516969476369
2067. if jews are identified as a religious	body in a controversy that comes before a national or international	tribunal it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity	to protect freedom of worship.	8.638500136821978
2068. when decision makers act within this	frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion	is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion.	10.683553895517223
2069. since the recognition of israel as a nation state claims are made	in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body	politic.	12.3146435624379
2070. community decision makers must make up their minds whether	a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing	expectations regarding members of nation states.	11.072879686797478
2071. in free countries	many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting	a vaguely cultural rather than religious or political identity.	9.336556360250325
2072. the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must	decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate	to public policy regarding cultural groups.	10.616643627227548
2073. we know that	much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that	cluster around the key symbol of the jew.	11.407447019810268
2074. many public and private controversies	will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in	the mind and usage of gentile and jew.	10.272123293013909
2075. however in the context of legal	and civic policy these controversies are less than novel.	14.863700709673699
2076. they	involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any	number of non-jewish groups.	10.635267499930531
2077. so far as the existing body of formal	principle and procedure is concerned categorical novelties are not	to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships; claims are properly	disposed of according to norms common to all parties.	9.603421764164725
2078. it	is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched	within the public order of the world community or even of free	commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews	and gentiles during coming years.	11.203525767883386
2079. social process is always anchored	in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations	where anchors are dragged or lost.	9.404722337810972
2080. in conformance with the	maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will	be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the	other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net	advantage taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration.	9.105105527264515
2081. it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions	will cumulate; for instance imagine the situation if israel	ever joins an enemy coalition.	12.388308177564907
2082. the formal position of americans who	identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the	jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors	cannot be so easily assessed.	11.09829566489573
2083. when we consider the disorganized	state of the world community and the legacy of predispositions adversely	directed against all who are identified as jews it is obvious	that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted	with increasing vigor and skill.	10.20638083148911
2084. during moments of intense crisis	the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming.	14.718685504484396
2085. but their	freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which	they and the people around them enter the crisis.	10.715931732786816
2086. at such critical	moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously pay	off.	14.054695083469458
2087. by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality	exercise their most sinister impact with the result that men	of good will are often trapped and nullified.	10.50397572013082
2088. among measures	in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants	of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of	the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also	able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near	the limit of self-control.	8.358583378157935
2089. we are learning how to do these things	in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process	can be accelerated.	11.245660573504429
2090. a truism is that the time to prepare	for the worst is when times are best.	14.707818747087185
2091. during intercrisis periods the	educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding	the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human	beings of every age and condition.	10.682420686117121
2092. as more men and women are made capable	of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved	that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength	in future crises can be favorably affected.	12.182960285219561
2093. now an abiding	difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach;	and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation	of the goodness of the good.	8.403014917931925
2094. in any case i do not intend to	let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the	problem of implementing good intentions.	13.78373020116539
2095. i assume that the number of	readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is	small and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which	they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding	of others.	9.078006221556928
2096. properly used the present book is an excellent instrument	of enlightenment.	11.664882534919581
2097. let us not confuse the issue by labeling	the objective or the method psychoanalytic for this is a well established	term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated	by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered	personalities.	8.878505731510366
2098. the traditional method proceeds by the technique	of free association punctuated by interpretations proposed by the	psychoanalytic interviewer.	11.248126132470816
2099. what we have in mind does have	something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods	by which they are sought.	14.613033863409534
2100. for what we propose however a psychoanalyst	is not necessary even though one aim is to enable the reader to	get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself.	9.51047948165881
2101. for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is	necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame	of mind.	12.154305562316567
2102. the relatively long and often colorful selections	in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in	what is said whether he responds with anger or applause.	9.555682172791093
2103. but simple	involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open permissive	inquiring posture of self-observation.	10.727131474754387
2104. the symposium provides	an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which	were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were	addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages	everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.	9.805937064105647
2105. an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important	and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage	of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances	within himself resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around	the central figure of the jew.	9.383046824488387
2106. two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special	significance for our time.	13.224810765628323
2107. one a reservation on the point i have just	made is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking pseudo-feeling and pseudo-willing	which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom.	8.694797102674437
2108. in essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the	values and experience of others rather than in one's own values	and experience.	11.506704826811342
2109. there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how	to be himself	reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody	else.	12.246922631707088
2110. clearly what the person brings to the reading is important.	12.942509504329879
2111. moreover if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in	a work he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs	them in how to evaluate a work he is helping them to achieve their	own identity.	7.367768673536702
2112. the second timely part of this sketch of literature	and the search for identity has to do with the difference between	good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products	of today.	12.721609362786612
2113. in the range and variety of characters who in their	literary lives get along all right with life styles one never imagined	possible there is an implicit lesson in differentiation.	9.928165159662539
2114. the reader	observing this process might ask why not be different?	13.569310574206803
2115.  and	find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species.	12.427412060084311
2116. the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has	only a permit to be like the models he sees even more like everybody	else.	9.941009614655485
2117. and this i think holds for values as well as life styles.	15.614986489378014
2118. one would need to test this proposition carefully; after all the large	reader's digest literature on the	most unforgettable character i ever met deals with village grocers	country doctors favorite if illiterate aunts and so forth.	9.490917550548726
2119. scientists	often turn out to be idiosyncratic too.	17.74725721785782
2120. but still the proposition	is worth examination.	21.91184403465631
2121. it is possible that the study	of literature affects the conscience the morality the sensitivity to	some code of right and wrong.	14.74177537859412
2122. i do not know that this is	true; both flu^gel and ranyard west deal with the development	and nature of conscience as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber.	12.948191510973112
2123. it forms the core of many perhaps most problems of psychotherapy.	15.302390976447409
2124. i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the	psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development	of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate	period of life or for the theologians of course to the influence	of religion.	11.463093034616604
2125. still it would be surprising if what one reads did	not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the	awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient	literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence.	8.26399783459225
2126. probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development	of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature	but the contents of conscience the code which is imparted to the developed	or immature conscience available.	10.620429644356895
2127. this is in large part a code	of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and	should do and how one should regard it.	11.809378876254994
2128. in a small way this is illustrated	by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful	influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated	this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover how to behave how	to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint.	9.317912836930176
2129. literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose dedication	mission significance.	13.590386103714517
2130. this no doubt is part of what gilbert seldes	implies when he says of the arts they give form and meaning	to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense.	11.190856996587847
2131. men	seem almost universally to want a sense of function that is a feeling	that their existence makes a difference to someone living or unborn	close and immediate or generalized.	8.241762691569658
2132. feeling useless seems generally	to be an unpleasant sensation.	12.3482207866056
2133. a need so deeply planted asking	for direction so to speak is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples	and heroic proportions of literature.	9.900905792130814
2134. the terms renewal	and refreshed which often come up in aesthetic discussion seem	partly to derive their import from the renewal of purpose and	a refreshed sense of significance a person may receive from poetry	drama and fiction.	9.177884225674259
2135. the notion of inspiration is somehow cognate	to this feeling.	12.204673387645432
2136. how literature does this or for whom is certainly	not clear but the content form and language of the message	as well as the source would all play differentiated parts in giving	and molding a sense of purpose.	10.477993516029349
2137. one of the most salient features	of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and	organization of emotion.	13.469197339558411
2138. let us differentiate a few of these ideas.	27.458102683304435
2139. the	aristotelian notion of catharsis the purging of emotion is a persistent	and viable one.	8.834168570742513
2140. the idea here is one of discharge but this	must stand in opposition to a second view plato's notion of the	arousal of emotion.	15.108503936865318
2141. a third idea is that artistic literature serves	to reduce emotional conflicts giving a sense of serenity and	calm to individuals.	10.025904258950932
2142. this is given some expression in beardsley's	notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision.	15.20295836430433
2143. a fourth view is	the transformation of emotion as in housman's fine phrase on the	arts: they transform and beautify our inner nature.	8.378567509257149
2144. it is possible	that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea.	19.567866834215256
2145. fsc	northrop in his discussion of the functions and future	of poetry suggests this: one of the things which makes	our lives drab and empty and which leaves us at the end of the day	fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing practical	utilitarian concern of common-sense objects.	10.058609489725775
2146. if art is to release	us from these postulated things things we must think symbolically	about and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the	aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy it must sever its connection	with these common sense entities.	9.344769452860747
2147. i take the central meaning	here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without	literature and a life enriched by it.	9.574952425437765
2148. richards' view of the aesthetic	experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes	in part the organization of impulses.	11.116905221833036
2149. a sketch of	the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account	of all of these.	13.918676824193703
2150. but there is one in particular which it seems	to me deserves special attention.	24.858000061336103
2151. in the wide range of experiences	common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage more	troublesome and more enduring in its effects than the control of love	and hate.	9.7569516262012
2152. the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious	way.	19.957984093252232
2153. william wimsatt and cleanth brooks it seems to me have	a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected:	for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love	and if it is to talk of anger and murder	- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing	with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification compounding	or magnification or any direct assault upon the affections	at all.	9.090385998936402
2154. something indirect mixed reconciling tensional might well	be the strategem the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all	kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like expressions	of these emotions without aiming at their incitement or	even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement.	8.9124997295217
2155. the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions	may be a most valuable human experience.	9.403879097775112
2156. here i do not mean	catharsis the discharge of emotion.	19.73378028013922
2157. i mean something more like freud's	concept of the utility of play to a small child: he plays	house or doctor or fireman as a way of mastering	slightly frightening experiences reliving them imaginatively until they	are under control.	8.901401617757072
2158. there is a second feature of the influences	of literature good literature on emotional life which may have	some special value for our time.	15.238464298499714
2159. in b m spinley's portrayal	of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london a salient	finding was the inability to postpone gratification a need to satisfy	impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring	the experience.	8.144124118752112
2160. perhaps it is only an analogy but one of the most	obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring	quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation.	11.68208357649943
2161. anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature	will understand what i mean.	10.935797288333498
2162. it is at least possible that the capacity	to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in	a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.	16.10404822097449
2163. in any	inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions particularly	with respect to the sense of harmony or relief of tension	or sense of a transformed inner nature which may occur a most	careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which	produces the effect would be required.	9.54495071206069
2164. in the calm which follows the	reading of a poem for example is the effect produced by the enforced	quiet by the musical quality of words and rhythm by the sentiments	or sense of the poem by the associations with earlier readings if it	is familiar by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate	by	the diversion of attention by the sense of security in a legitimized	withdrawal by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded	as forbidden or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of	words?	8.31747637580507
2165.  these are if the research is done with subtlety and skill	researchable topics but the research is missing.	9.577448959333903
2166. one of the	most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility	that it is thought to provide.	21.161222917238323
2167. sensibility is a vague word	covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent quality	or skill.	8.69399504443662
2168. among other things it means perception discrimination sensitivity	to subtle differences.	17.394457089228133
2169. both the extent to which this is true	and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged.	12.466827838028514
2170. its truth is illustrated by the skill sensitivity and general	expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre.	11.18490948688625
2171. the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast	the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues	in discriminating among motor cars political candidates or female	beauty.	8.860541165718026
2172. along these lines the particular point that sensitivity	in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more	proof than i have seen.	10.019760605809617
2173. in a symposium and general exploration of	the field of person perception and interpersonal behavior the	discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one	possible exception; solomon asch shows the transcultural stability	of metaphors based on sensation dealing	with personal qualities of human beings and events.	8.421476562757377
2174. but to go from here	to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will	also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential	leap.	11.655092066387473
2175. i would say too that the study of literature	tends to give a person what i shall call depth.	15.110344284685379
2176. i use this term	to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event	or state of affairs a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts	and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling.	10.633651858753177
2177. it	is the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia.	12.074836758973841
2178. i	think these attributes cluster but i have no evidence.	15.573257481245454
2179. in fact i	can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide continuous and	properly guided exposure to literary art.	13.29272435124916
2180. the late r g collingwood a philosopher whose work	has proved helpful to many students of literature once wrote we	are all though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it in	far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace	than with chaucer and cimabue or even shakespeare and titian.	9.623842402011467
2181. by	an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the	art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the carvings of	cavemen and japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this	effort	is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the	greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries	and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not	taken place.	7.183465230608749
2182. the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy	contemporary art to despise and dislike the art of the recent past	and wholly to ignore everything else.	12.432918063561557
2183. one might argue that	the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous	provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general	public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself.	9.210134827633047
2184. there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the	contemporary.	18.392527205050744
2185. such study may take many forms.	14.877523625402274
2186. the study of ideas in	literature is one of these.	33.49608417898641
2187. of course it goes without saying that no	student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene.	12.440011797605589
2188. he will	frequently return to it.	22.138369972610576
2189. the continuities contrasts and similarities	discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible	and the one is often understood through the other.	8.87034902286215
2190. when	we assert the value of such study we find ourselves committed to	an important assumption.	12.596189531827198
2191. most students of literature whether they call	themselves scholars or critics are ready to argue that it is possible	to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them.	11.235102091235653
2192. many will	add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding.	13.007664892548767
2193. this	understanding of course may in its turn take many forms and some	of these- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative	literature- are essentially historical.	7.6489668492104235
2194. but the historian of	literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic	questions of form texture or technique.	11.895168599044348
2195. he may also consider	ideas.	30.368575130042583
2196. it is true that this distinction between style and idea often	approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and	content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes	appear as expressions of the same insight.	13.25494741699772
2197. but in general we	may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention	toward one or the other.	13.224548376049025
2198. at this point a working definition	of idea is in order although our first definition will have to	be qualified somewhat as we proceed.	12.935854492824454
2199. the term idea refers to our	more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies	of sensuous or emotional experience.	9.135417957822767
2200. it is through such reflection	that literature approaches philosophy.	29.239651597249072
2201. an idea let us say may be	roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may	be concerned.	8.483670987024539
2202. in this essay we are	along with most historians interested	in the more general or more inclusive ideas that are so to speak	writ large in history of literature where they recur continually.	10.297381953214872
2203. outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself including	the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries;	also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man the depravity	of man and the dignity of man.	8.421710728281054
2204. one might indeed argue that the	history of ideas in so far as it includes the literatures must center	on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of	literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference	to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning.	10.165736879146445
2205. we need not to be sure expect to find such ideas in every piece of	literature.	15.457632028709382
2206. an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of	necessity readily available to imagination is more general in connotation	than most poetic or literary images especially those appearing in	lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience.	11.725373517287467
2207. thus	burns's my love is like a red red rose and hopkins'	the thunder-purple sea-beach plumed purple of	thunder although clearly intelligible in content hardly present	ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned.	8.803720802785561
2208. on the other hand	arnold's the unplumbed salt estranging sea	taken in its context certainly does so.	16.1378667357311
2209. understanding a work	of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies.	10.95926671610873
2210. thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify	a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject	matter typical or atypical of its period.	9.535602198153601
2211. again he may discover embodied	within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere	and at other times in various ways.	8.731358931447748
2212. our understanding will very	probably require both these commentaries.	15.011475056270628
2213. very likely it will also include	a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or belongs	to some way of thought labelled as a school or an -ism	ie a complex or syndrome of ideas occurring together	with sufficient prominence to warrant identification.	7.2077110424053386
2214. thus ideas like	grace salvation and providence cluster together	in traditional christianity.	13.158434145732949
2215. usually the work studied offers us a special	or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in	question so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully	between the several expressions of an -ism or mode of thought.	9.339567683408502
2216. accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley's	poems or the type of stoicism present in henley's invictus	and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism	and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or	mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise.	9.587180953656985
2217. after all	shelley is no orthodox or hellenic platonist and even his	romantic platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries.	9.742412340799225
2218. again henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal	of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like	marcus aurelius whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian	comparable to the patience expressed in milton's sonnet on his own	blindness.	8.941721635304607
2219. in recent years we have come increasingly to recognize	that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters	of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature	and the arts although these aspects should be studied in conjunction	with the history of philosophy of religion and of the sciences.	9.701758877087457
2220. when these fields are surveyed together important patterns of	relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence	a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions primarily	literary religious and philosophical but frequently including	contact with the fine arts and even to some extent with science.	9.55427785931031
2221. here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history	is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives	of the historian's research.	9.997943495155086
2222. let us quote once more from r g	collingwood: history is properly concerned with the actions	of human beings h regarded from the outside an action is an event	or series of events occurring in the physical world; regarded from the	inside it is the carrying into action of a certain thought h the	historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions	with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts	which constituted them.	9.458189906934841
2223. it is a characteristic of thoughts that h	in re-thinking them we come ipso facto to understand why they were	thought.	12.722748278803733
2224. such an understanding although it must seek to be sympathetic	is not a matter of intuition.	14.406613572197763
2225. history has this in common	with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim	any single piece of knowledge except where he can justify his claim	by exhibiting to himself in the first place and secondly to any one	else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration the grounds	upon which it is based.	8.68087831776581
2226. this is what was meant above by describing	history as inferential.	21.306097337622827
2227. the knowledge in virtue of which a man	is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves	about certain events.	10.731852132331243
2228. it is obvious that the historian who seeks	to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout	a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of	his central and major concerns by no means a mere supplement or adjunct	of significant historical research.	11.045318467214225
2229. the student of ideas and	their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of	transition which are at the same time patterns of transformation whereby	ideas pass from one area of activity to another.	10.199978651653904
2230. let us survey	for a moment the development of modern thought- turning our attention	from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements	that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades.	10.945726525918205
2231. we may thus	trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious	practice and theological reflection through practical politics	and political theory into literature and the arts.	8.758349992290292
2232. finally we may note	that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is	at present widespread.	12.043895680818977
2233. no one will deny that such broad developments	and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas	in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference	to them.	9.52167989322384
2234. still we must remember that we cannot construct and justify	generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special	instances of influence moving between such areas as theology philosophy	political thought and literature.	11.021554973152758
2235. the actual moments of contact	are vitally important.	14.48913098287042
2236. these moments are historical events in the	lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature	must be frequently concerned.	11.317551528967225
2237. perhaps the most powerful	and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world	has been that of the old and new testament.	13.653508298938817
2238. certainly one of	the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural	life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen	or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders	have read and interpreted the bible.	13.044994548200076
2239. this reading and the comments	that it evoked constitute the influence.	11.839384908174944
2240. a contrast of the scripture	reading of let us say st augustine john bunyan and thomas	jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment	can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age	that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression.	9.606615336832798
2241. in	much the same way we recognize the importance of shakespeare's familarity	with plutarch and montaigne of shelley's study of plato's	dialogues and of coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings	of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling	and william godwin through which so many abstract ideas were brought	to the attention of english men of letters.	7.665514381892529
2242. we may also recognize	cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and	even indirectly the scientists.	14.408567113234504
2243. english philosopher samuel alexander's	debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example	as also a n whitehead's understanding of the english romantics	chiefly shelley and wordsworth.	8.975005809392375
2244. hegel's profound admiration	for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel	of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy.	9.412054727957594
2245. again the	student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating if to our minds	grotesque anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the	natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius who in turn seems to	have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles.	7.70978759231901
2246. here	an important caveat is in order.	13.915190642667962
2247. we must avoid the notion suggested	to some people by examples such as those just mentioned that ideas	are units in some way comparable to coins or counters that can	be passed intact from one group of people to another or even for that	matter from one individual to another.	7.846276630181005
2248. suppose you take mr hearst's morning american at	$10000 a year brisbane proposed.	11.902979107379522
2249. you could come down to the	office once a day look over a few exchanges dictate an editorial	and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary	labors.	9.680852493717714
2250. if within one year you can make a success out of the american	you can practically name your own salary thereafter.	14.231846666033045
2251. of course	if you don't make the american a success hearst will have	no further use for you.	9.94185293941226
2252. the blue-eyed watson decided that	he would dislike living in new york and the deal fell through.	13.405476351700585
2253. hearst's	luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k	lane a prominent california journalist and reform politician whom	he asked for his support.	8.533312030717315
2254. lane was still burning because he had narrowly	missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat	to the antagonism of hearst's san francisco examiner.	9.255023412105547
2255. hearst	disclaimed blame for this but the conversation according to lane	ended on a tart note.	9.32051638261799
2256. mr lane hearst said if	you ever wish anything that i can do all you will have to do will	be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.	13.646605837241975
2257. mr	hearst lane replied as he left if you ever get a telegram	from me asking you to do anything you can put the telegram down	as a forgery.	8.709930633276072
2258. hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to	new york to become a father.	11.028030571255346
2259. on april 10 1904 his first child was	born a son named george after the late senator.	10.241543724784615
2260. hearst saw his wife	and child sent a joyful message to his mother in california and	soon returned to washington where on april 22 for the first time	he opened his mouth in congress.	9.38141230076927
2261. this was not before the house	but before the judiciary committee where he asked for action on	one of his pet bills that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad	monopoly.	9.969791652730873
2262. attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and	had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united	states attorney for the southern district of new york.	9.603071005699906
2263. hearst	had spent more than $60000 of his own money in the probe but still	attorney general knox was quiescent.	9.413318471867473
2264. six of the railroads	carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields hearst said	not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright	at least eleven mines.	10.052308469336314
2265. they had watered their stock at immense	profit then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton netting themselves	another $20000000 in annual profit.	9.597016622004542
2266. the attorney	general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a	doorknob for eighteen months hearst said.	10.351870993004653
2267. he has not acted in	any way and won't let anyone take it away from him h what i want	is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney	general does not report it as i am very sure he won't as he has	refused to do anything of the kind i then wish that a committee of	seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence	h.	8.138963444793404
2268. the congressman tried hard but failed.	24.49575181015932
2269. this was the very	sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind.	14.060134804157384
2270. there can	be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington overt or	implied to block anything hearst wanted even if it was something good.	16.534735640797702
2271. hatred tied his hands in congress.	13.046750977003184
2272. roosevelt and others considered	him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley.	14.87222147864119
2273. they were repelled	by his noisy newspapers his personal publicity his presumptuous	campaign for the presidential nomination and by the swelling cloud	of rumor about his moral lapses.	9.328339446974752
2274. he might get votes from his constituents	but he would never get a helping hand in congress.	13.411786683512647
2275. he was the	house pariah.	29.19812536008293
2276. even the regular democrats disowned him.	22.241032306174414
2277. inherently	incapable of cooperating with others he ran his own show regardless	of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on.	7.9139724503302755
2278. he was a political	maverick a reformer with his own program determined to bulldoze	it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him.	12.846351648975325
2279. he showed	little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats.	12.305793955425997
2280. he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or	journal a scheme veteran legislators resisted.	11.97062034758442
2281. for a freshman congressman	to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor	policy for one who needed to make friends.	10.469490818248966
2282. he soon quarreled with all	the party leaders in the house and came to be regarded with detestation	by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small	pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to	party discipline.	11.212004061901384
2283. to old-line democrats the hearst presidential	boom now in full cry was the joke of the new century.	10.104519462913192
2284. yet no	leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t	r a semblance of a race.	12.922497767570903
2285. there was talk of dragging old ex-president	cleveland out of retirement for another try.	14.76236827540316
2286. some preferred	judge alton b parker of new york.	14.6300980236232
2287. there was a host of dark	horses.	37.1820214703831
2288. the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that	he had strong support in many parts of the country.	12.734518734257552
2289. platoons of hearst	agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful	search for delegates at the coming convention and there were charges	that money was doing a large part of the persuading.	9.370948030941564
2290. just when	it was needed for the campaign hearst paper no 8 the boston american	began publication.	12.54248206246634
2291. a bay state supporter said mr	hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of	his paper in boston.	8.65154846580987
2292. his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat.	15.982618402857776
2293. he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain	from using such words as seduction rape abortion	criminal assault and born out of wedlock.	8.36063035076749
2294. in	a story headed hearst offers cash the republican new york	tribune spread the money rumor quoting an unnamed hearst	supporter as saying:   the argument that is cutting most	ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts	fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt	them if he were elected.	8.644724633871208
2295. the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated	he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic	national committee the sum of $1500000.	9.581614412001587
2296. this it is urged would	relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the	trust magnates.	13.502070610417915
2297. the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate	is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the	trusts for their campaign funds and in doing this will incur obligations	which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless h.	8.510751763066727
2298. the average democratic politician especially in the country districts	is hungry for the spoils of office.	15.683212826815916
2299. it has been a long time since	he has seen any campaign money and when the proposition is laid down	to him as the friends of mr hearst are laying it down these days	he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon.	10.163890735495078
2300. if	anything the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than	the republicans.	10.957705180640192
2301. in his own state of new york the two democratic	bellwethers state leader hill and tammany boss murphy were	saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their	own favorites murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker.	9.02138949785226
2302. they	had lost twice with the radical bryan and were having no part of	hearst whom they considered more radical than bryan.	9.159936216703418
2303. but his increasing	strength in the west looked menacing.	18.939558279949935
2304. it caused henry watterson	to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal:	h does any sane democrat believe that mr hearst a person	unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues without a word	or	act in the public life of his country past or present that can be	shown to be his to commend him could by any possibility be elected president	of the united states?	9.203650857414955
2305.  but there is a hearst	barrel h	more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee	a parker man.	17.36703008557925
2306. h the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin	of the party carmack said.	12.7753265607222
2307. it would be a disgrace and as i	have already said to the people of tennessee if hearst is nominated	we may as well pen a dispatch and send it back from the field of	battle: 'all is lost including our honor'.	10.417689898601177
2308. a lone	pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery	who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence	in his own district.	11.39212905010574
2309. i understand hearst is a candidate	for presidential honors devery said without cracking a smile.	10.570247354893553
2310. there's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up.	8.67718592807756
2311. if he's	going to the st louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it.	11.697248557214511
2312. he's got a lot of friends and he ought to come along and let us	know if he wants our help.	7.947445967022313
2313. hearst won the iowa state convention	but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker	drawing an angry statement from indiana's john w kern:	we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic	by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase	the presidential nomination.	8.9294149218198
2314. our state has been overrun with a	gang of paid agents and retainers h as for the paid hessians from	other states we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their	duty i have nothing but contempt h the hearst dollar mark is all	over them h	the talk of a hearst barrel was increasing.	8.27313804500887
2315. another indiana observer later commented perhaps we shall	never know how much was spent by hearst but if as much money	was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered.	7.58661590961735
2316. in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations	hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence	the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago	kingpin and once to meet with bryan.	10.007527540777115
2317. on one visit he stopped at	the office of the american where he was known surreptitiously as	the great white chief and for the first time met his managing	editor fat moses koenigsberg.	11.603965442989503
2318. koenigsberg never did learn what	hearst wanted for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door.	9.723773562266802
2319. never mind thank you he said.	13.285037240209318
2320. i must hurry to catch	my train.	23.57168967663813
2321. another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle	of letters that had accumulated for him saying but mr hearst	what shall i do with this correspondence?	7.871002292858313
2322.    i'll	show you hearst replied grinning.	15.068811854765874
2323. he took the stack of mail and	tossed it into the waste basket.	14.493381412533994
2324. every letter answers	itself in a couple of weeks.	17.779797959420456
2325. hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen	and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and	southern states always wearing a frock coat listening intently to local	politicians and generally making a good impression.	7.183342336453902
2326. he laughed	at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated.	15.716095490689643
2327. i should of course he said like any other man be	honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me.	11.156987332871813
2328. but	i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat.	18.437397769451476
2329. i have supported	the democratic party in the last five campaigns.	24.284872478981217
2330. i supported	cleveland three times and bryan twice.	18.16939557663476
2331. i intend to support the nominee	of the party at st louis whoever he may be.	10.756659392205208
2332. the	hearst press followed the chief's progress at the various state conventions	with its usual admiring attention stressing the enthusiasm	and loyalty he inspired.	9.051154372622117
2333. this was historic in its way for	it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised	his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land.	9.785857097575953
2334. yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value.	12.902726709851187
2335. when nan patterson a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who	had appeared in a florodora road show rode down broadway in a hansom	cab with her married lover frank young she stopped the cab to	disclose that young had been shot dead tearfully insisting that he	had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so.	7.385138943173687
2336. trevelyan's liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit a	deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty.	10.775436594875824
2337. his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure	of garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation	in the events described.	8.233439231805194
2338. the three volumes brought to	the fore a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous	through his later works- a genius for describing military action	with clarity and with authority.	9.892947801128074
2339. the confused rambling of guerrilla	warfare such as most of garibaldi's campaigns were was brought	to life by trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books.	10.5293763743525
2340. his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed	much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have	been enough without other qualities.	11.29585150652516
2341. military knowledge love of	detail and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added	ingredients.	8.385862995236538
2342. but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic	story.	20.6911363267697
2343. trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues	connected with his subject.	10.781916991690267
2344. the outstanding example was in garibaldi	and the thousand where he made use of unpublished papers of	lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives	which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross	the straits of messina.	10.099953551924552
2345. in looking back over the volumes it	is possible to find errors of interpretation some of which were not	so evident at the time of writing.	12.760273144283413
2346. thus trevelyan repeats the story	which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto	at the insistence of general radetzky.	10.773120422435184
2347. later research has	shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false.	12.37118140131784
2348. trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis he is	unduly critical of papal and french policy and he is more than generous	in assessing british policy.	10.706296008293746
2349. but fifty years later the trilogy still	maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification	of italy a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at	the time of publication.	9.723789974416734
2350. trevelyan's manin and the venetian	revolution of 1848 his last major volume on an italian theme	was written in a minor key.	9.159936216703418
2351. published in 1923 it did not gain the popular	acclaim of the garibaldi volumes probably because trevelyan	felt less at home with manin the bourgeois lawyer than with garibaldi	the filibuster.	8.000712430870545
2352. the complexities of venetian politics eluded him	but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures	with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of	the part played by its leading figure.	9.97280438876379
2353. if it is not one of his best	books it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his	own garibaldi.	19.74753596167787
2354. already trevelyan had begun to parallel	his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english	figures of the same period.	11.445162641221364
2355. first the life of john bright appeared	and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill.	12.617927349825072
2356. of	the two the life of bright is incomparably the better biography.	13.690784622972503
2357. trevelyan	centers too exclusively on bright is insufficiently appreciative	of the views of bright's opponents and critics and makes light	of the genuine difficulties faced by peel.	8.087448802501262
2358. yet he is right when he	claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man	his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength.	11.076023971361725
2359. in	the story of bright and the corn law agitation the crimean war	the american civil war and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects	something of the moral power which enabled this independent man	to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so	long.	7.3197197510232614
2360. because bright's speeches were so much a part of him there	are long and numerous quotations which far from making the biography	diffuse help to give us the feel of the man.	12.068081095010648
2361. associated in a sense	with the manchester school through his mother's family trevelyan	conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive.	7.894606496227992
2362. nineteenth-century virtues however seem somehow to have gone out	of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular.	10.248964846740106
2363. the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography	at all.	10.956636136957574
2364. it is a whig history of the tory reaction which preceded	the reform bill of 1832 and it uses the figure of grey to	give some unity to the narrative.	13.44424776599915
2365. the volume is a piece of passionate	special pleading written with the heat- and often with the wisdom	it must be said- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians	from 1782 to 1832.	9.142171007715653
2366. characteristically trevelyan enjoyed writing	the work.	15.068811854765874
2367. the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter	of discontent and repression was he has told us congenial to his artistic	sense.	10.02384120075947
2368. and grey's northumberland background was close to	trevelyan's own.	15.795442852282704
2369. but his concentration on personalities and his categorical	assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities	of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted	with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social	transformation.	8.435120903601023
2370. some historians have found his point of view not	to their taste others have complained that he makes the tory tradition	appear contemptible rather than intelligible while a sympathetic	critic has remarked that the intricate interplay of social dynamics	and political activity of which at times politicians are the	ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents.	9.019118385119617
2371. the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan's	interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues	and oversimplified the period.	8.535996319710994
2372. for once his touch deserted him.	18.928712821960165
2373. research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to	a more ambitious work.	9.242743962447554
2374. britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook	designed to give the sense of continuous growth to show how	economic led to social and social to political change how the political	events reacted on the economic and social and how new thoughts and	new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process.	9.961694908607784
2375. the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832.	13.851018259377332
2376. more temperately	than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias trevelyan	vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days	portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich	colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp	and clear focus.	9.613695397195778
2377. his technique is genuinely masterful.	16.59111679669348
2378. by what one	reader called a series of dissolving views he merges one period	into another and gives a sense of continuous growth.	11.84251682314222
2379. but after	1832 the narrative tends to lose its balanced many-sided quality	and to become a medley of topics often unconnected by any single thread.	9.514580737507934
2380. economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the	england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis.	10.24245722339134
2381. yet after 1832 the interrelations of economic and social and political	affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional	political account.	8.82768473790055
2382. finally the period after 1870 receives	little attention and that quite superficial.	12.116423288136446
2383. yet britain in the nineteenth	century became the vade mecum of beginning students of	history went through edition after edition and continues to be reprinted	up to the very present.	8.435465380324752
2384. its success is a tribute above all to	trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist.	11.901893423153721
2385. in 1924 trevelyan	traveled to the united states where he delivered the lowell	lectures at harvard university.	15.870534958066875
2386. these lectures formed the nucleus of	a general survey of english development which took form afterward as	a history of england.	10.000667142840305
2387. in short order the general history became	his most popular work and has remained aside from his later social	history the work most widely favored by the public.	9.133040084583298
2388. the	history of england has often been compared with green's short	history.	11.33819267263277
2389. like green trevelyan aimed to write a history not	of english kings or english conquests but of the english people.	10.69687075091935
2390. the history takes too much for	granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys and like	britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes	beyond 1870.	13.228182667984445
2391. trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were	rarely happy ones.	10.530932308755343
2392. but as a stimulating provocative interpretation	of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable.	15.643032376840917
2393. living	pictures of the early boroughs country life in tudor and stuart	times the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive	surveys of language and literature the common law parliamentary development.	8.287437071528851
2394. the strength of the history is also its weakness.	19.573720223947266
2395. trevelyan	is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and	character over those of other peoples.	8.450640073948662
2396. his	nationalism was not a new characteristic but its self-consciousness	even its self-satisfaction is more obvious in a book that stretches	over the long reach of english history.	10.08458244631935
2397. and yet the elements which	capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the	english story worth telling and worth remembering.	10.106581289236523
2398. tolerance and	compromise social justice and civil liberty are today too often in short	supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan's emphasis on	their central place in the english tradition.	10.267229936217696
2399. like most major works	of synthesis the history of england is informed by the positive	views of a first-class mind and this is surely a major work.	10.16172987415926
2400. four years after the publication of the history of england the	first volume of trevelyan's queen anne trilogy appeared.	13.663841137255195
2401. by now	he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge	and had been honored by the award of the order of merit.	11.728240956098437
2402. his academic	duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen.	13.124284270623187
2403. blenheim	was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with	scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the	three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne.	7.834283885688894
2404. like his volume on wycliffe the work was accompanied by the	publication of a selected group of documents in this case illustrative	of the history of queen anne's reign down to 1707.	11.77358109252179
2405. trevelyan	was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious	desire to take up the story where macaulay's history of england	had broken off.	10.291021643944664
2406. in addition he believed in the dramatic	unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 lying between the stuart	and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own.	12.877882662758138
2407. he saw	the age as one in which britain settled her free constitution	and attained her modern place in the world.	11.19580781968378
2408. to most observers there	is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon	the years of anne's reign which in reality existed only in the	pages	of his history.	10.74440137613658
2409. of the three volumes blenheim is easily	the best.	21.95930214034891
2410. in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay's famous	third chapter trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening	of the eighteenth century.	11.936654202856769
2411. his delightful picture of society and	institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly	to life.	8.708276189313924
2412. he tends to underestimate- or perhaps to view charitably-	the brutality and the violence of the age so that there is an idyllic	quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality.	12.598679368352467
2413. yet as an evocation of time past there are few such successful	portraits	in english historical literature.	10.138253612931582
2414. once the scene is set trevelyan	skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax	in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim.	10.194256991409802
2415. the account of the battle is next to his descriptions of garibaldi's	campaigns trevelyan's outstanding military narrative.	11.964456385633458
2416. the	scene is etched in sharp detail the military problems brilliantly	explained and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident.	10.40165044808776
2417. if only for this modest masterpiece of military history blenheim	is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations	have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars.	11.216427350456764
2418. ramillies	and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim	and much less of its dramatic unity.	10.067868297651657
2419. yet in several chapters	on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan copes persuasively	with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background	of scottish religion customs and traditions.	9.489632807907299
2420. i stood on a table surrounded by hundreds of expectant young	faces.	14.721681118665556
2421. questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship	activities.	10.24989412311706
2422. after making a short statement about human rights and the	freedom to travel i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge	the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany.	11.297891628773174
2423. may we come with you?	13.56414853562784
2424.  called out a dozen young voices.	17.90205508097493
2425. well i might not get that far i told them as actually	i have no papers to enter germany and as a matter of fact no permit	to return to france once i leave.	10.073360009442116
2426. that was all they needed.	30.855578870984758
2427. we would all meet at ten o'clock at	the kehl bridge five miles from strasbourg and march triumphantly	across into germany.	10.039900735849148
2428. there was only one hitch: the small town	of kehl on the other side of the rhine was still under french	jurisdiction.	23.45438314114983
2429. the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town's	limits.	14.61160113810511
2430. in fact all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into	kehl there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river.	13.978110611203618
2431. that evening as i learned later the students enjoying that	spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students surged	out onto the streets of strasbourg overturning empty streetcars	marking up store fronts and shouting imprudently garry davis	to power!   as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the	next morning i was met by what looked like 5000 students some of whom	were carrying sticks apparently for the coming battle with the	police.	7.092482877526978
2432. alarmed by this display of weapons i looked toward the bridge	and there saw stretched across the near side a cordon of policemen	their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french	officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby.	7.940654606847042
2433. listen please i called to the students in french.	12.015495612094641
2434. i	thank you most heartily for being here.	13.037321475654965
2435. this is full evidence of your	support for my principles.	17.110891738194216
2436. these principles however will not be served	by violence in any form.	14.903652324962774
2437. if they are right they will prevail of	and by themselves.	19.095940824141636
2438. i ask you all to support me in this.	15.617933246778371
2439. if one finger	is raised against the authorities all our moral power will vanish.	12.610046346487861
2440. your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your	understanding of what i am saying.	14.152789363145235
2441. i have full confidence in you.	22.464762227576294
2442. i marched up to the waiting officials the students	massed behind me.	15.908239963394985
2443. as usual the press photographers were on hand.	15.30789638648334
2444. the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade	and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france.	10.601404265342117
2445. i replied	in the affirmative taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite	et de voyage on which was stamped a permission to leave fran	e.	9.072663404594447
2446. he examined it carefully handed it back and said eh bien	you may leave france.	12.264873606853545
2447. i took one step h eastward.	20.66409020551914
2448. one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way demanding to know	whether i had permission to enter germany.	15.084879015182064
2449. no i have	no permission to enter germany i told him.	11.826264653724177
2450. alors	you may go no farther he said imperiously.	12.3482207866056
2451. is this then	the frontier?	25.924824210684953
2452.  i asked him.	44.19633069992955
2453. at this	the students let out a yell knowing full well the actual frontier was	beyond the town of kehl.	10.274808075430597
2454. but i have no permission to re-enter	france and i have just left i told him.	20.663163151773524
2455. i must then	be standing on the line between france and germany.	13.27954156911855
2456. the	waspish man stepped forward.	16.6462465444584
2457. line?	24.303019953065355
2458.  line?	28.49691246350829
2459.  but there is no line	between france and germany that is no actual line h i mean	h   no line?	14.982198498698251
2460.  i asked.	41.238904484261255
2461. but if there is no line	how can there be two countries?	21.04895076982044
2462.  you have just given me permission	to leave france which i did.	17.086452787243445
2463. and as you know	i have no permission to re-enter france once out.	12.64342047900908
2464. now i learn i	cannot	enter germany.	19.39209323646518
2465. obviously i'm stuck on the line between the two	countries.	11.156261552145127
2466. the students were laughing uproariously at this	piece of logic and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile.	11.725053616939288
2467. mais non the interior ministry man coaxed you	may come back to strasbourg now if you wish.	8.29272515769823
2468. oh?	28.49691246350829
2469.  then	will you give me a visa to re-enter france?	10.672626180961885
2470.    visa?	28.49691246350829
2471. 	but there is no question of a visa.	14.00139830044206
2472. you are still in france.	29.681547660399033
2473. ah then please tell me where the frontier is because this	gentleman here- i indicated the french occupation officer- informs	me that germany is just on the other side of him.	9.840753450693997
2474. the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot.	15.564228079022906
2475. from the	crowd were coming cries of he's right! there must be	a line! and bravo garry continue!   seeing their	hesitation i said well until i have permission to enter germany	or a visa to re-enter france i shall be obliged to remain here	h on the line between two countries whereupon i moved to the	side of the road parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on	the sidewalk sat down took out my typewriter and began typing the	above conversation.	6.8988340793233185
2476. the reporters were questioning the interior	man and the french officer both of whom remained noncommittal as	to what action if any would be taken in my regard.	10.255263219993413
2477. finally they	went	off to file their stories after the photographers had taken pictures	of my latest vigil.	9.148585280170224
2478. the students crowded around asking questions slapping	me on the back and generally being friendly.	13.504755725279448
2479. but what	will you do this evening mr davis?	14.594994348557169
2480.  asked a young mustached	frenchman.	20.098980870672325
2481. it will be very cold.	41.81761221512873
2482. i don't know	i told him except that i will be here.	10.080362984588072
2483. i shall	see about getting you a tent he said.	13.319440967794202
2484. i have a small sports shop	in strasbourg.	27.1009109587478
2485. that would be a great help i told him	thanking him for his thoughtfulness.	14.711661210534228
2486. a special guard was posted at	my end of the bridge to make sure i didn't cross the ludicrousness	of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else- men	women and children dogs cats horses cars trucks baby carriages-	could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance.	9.56435278521127
2487. the	day passed eventfully enough with a constant stream of visitors some	stopping only to say hello others getting into serious conversations	such as one andre fuchs a free-lance journalist from strasbourg	who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic	terms.	6.846053805346686
2488. some students from the university returned around six	with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week.	11.928080233740948
2489. a volunteer	food brigade had been arranged they told me which would supply	me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge.	9.56250113646894
2490. a little	later the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent.	12.549504625430263
2491. one of	the girl students sitting by while i ate the thick soup asked me if	i had a sleeping bag.	9.708374493661626
2492. when i informed her that i didn't she said	she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening.	11.822140585344801
2493. you do not know me she said in good english but	my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child.	10.708174843479142
2494. her name was esther peter.	17.721931424896393
2495. i was delighted to make that personal	contact in such trying and unusual circumstances.	14.261999612976815
2496. the peter family	proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days mrs	peter little esther and raoul who generously lent me his sleeping	bag for my watch on the rhine.	9.8843991264316
2497. sighting a line from	the bridge to a small field directly to the side i pitched the tent	that evening on the stateless line digging a small trench around	it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child.	7.325685275597688
2498. the wind from the rhine was damp and chill necessitating a fire	for warmth.	12.010194183656237
2499. after scouring around a bit in the open area i came across	what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly	giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky.	8.680755857931212
2500. each evening	the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits	pains esther usually being among them.	10.590283081361788
2501. i had advised friends to	write me to no man's land pont kehl between strasbourg and	kehl france-germany.	11.020515977316855
2502. sure enough mail began trickling in	delivered by a talkative highly amused french postman who informed me	there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that	address would be recognized.	9.219123869072062
2503. on christmas eve students brought	out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the	tent.	10.495561397163915
2504. as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural	playground for the kids of the neighborhood i had made many friends	among them taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately	to translate grimm's fairy tales into an understandable	french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent.	9.94895252025048
2505. to my great	surprise and delight when they saw the two trees they went rushing	off returning shortly with decorations from their own trees.	8.851479059856656
2506. it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year.	19.40980696776215
2507. in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne	heidelberg and baden-baden.	12.450870274676012
2508. twenty thousand world citizens at	stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town.	12.726589236891643
2509. when	dr adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find	out his disposition of my case he gave them his personal approval	of my entry saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into	germany.	7.621077902832876
2510. the special guard however was still posted on kehl bridge.	13.569310574206803
2511. as it began raining at around eight o'clock on december	26th i retired into my tent early somewhat tired and discouraged	my body reacting sluggishly	because of the continued exposure.	9.053875168649068
2512. no matter	how large the fire i couldn't seem to shake off the chill that	day.	11.482274194235654
2513. oh mr davis are you there?	13.809035295458894
2514.  a voice drifted	in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen	into a fitful sleep.	10.427373601748448
2515. who is it?	31.824368552681605
2516.    we're from	the council of europe british delegation.	9.791790557701209
2517. may we have a word with	you?	14.71913924584521
2518.    i'm sorry.	7.7639637677948805
2519. i've had a trying day and i just	can't make it out again i told them.	6.546364115282726
2520. later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire	to see me hence their trip to no man's land.	9.980933831182067
2521. on	the evening of december 27th esther noticed my pallid look and rasping	voice.	10.367717955873738
2522. she entreated me to see a doctor and when i refused brought	one out to see me.	13.36407938688773
2523. i wouldn't	hear of it because it meant giving up the line though i	realized i was in poor shape physically.	10.586082931643046
2524. esther mistaking my hesitation	assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by	a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached.	9.260509069372928
2525. no it's not that i told her.	13.673640231008864
2526. you see once i relinquish	the position i've already established here i couldn't regain	it without sacrificing the logic of it.	11.231110315562335
2527. at that moment	up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a	world citizen from basel switzerland.	10.31118219204958
2528. without preliminaries esther	asked him if you are a world citizen will you take garry davis'	place in his tent while he goes to the hospital?	12.568061962493836
2529.    but	of course with pleasure he replied.	11.867291106449708
2530. i looked from her to him.	21.494108554008594
2531. what is your name?	29.813322601467355
2532.  i	asked him.	22.4402793574494
2533. you	have just enlisted for the 'rhine campaign'.	11.118618003375188
2534. esther	jumped up ran to him and gave him a little hug.	13.059928161853433
2535. now come garry we must go quickly.	13.667185638947299
2536. there is a police car	outside.	55.20341447538758
2537. maybe they will take us.	17.21796165136863
2538. such were the incongruities	of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me	were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world	citizen jean babel waved adieu from the line!	he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of	the final desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy.	10.06446897922788
2539. when the	victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted with	his	horse pressed broadside against cleburne's log parapet in a tangled	group of infantrymen.	8.603215544785197
2540. his hat was gone the tears were streaming	from his eyes.	12.517407265378024
2541. he never knew how he got there.	16.021105596993785
2542. six climactic minutes	in an individual's life left no memory.	13.513717336433874
2543. eight hundred and sixty-five	rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were	captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day.	8.21204036389277
2544. eight	field guns were captured in position.	13.915190642667962
2545. seven battle flags and fourteen	officers' swords were sent to thomas' headquarters.	10.145537647683177
2546. it was	the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks	successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign.	13.534532584567184
2547. the	fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers	within a few minutes among them being several men whose time of service	had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment.	7.559089608790805
2548. the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers one of the regiments	in thomas' first division during buell's command suffered	its greatest loss of the war in this action.	12.48879335259717
2549. a popular belief	grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that	thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up	stanley for this assault.	11.081760402137654
2550. sherman was responsible for the story when	he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall	seeing thomas ride so fast.	12.43140401082764
2551. while thomas' injured back led him to	restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough	when he had to.	8.238329909897104
2552. it is not in the record but he must have galloped his	horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward's guns to save	newton's crumbling line.	14.94558379887543
2553. while the final combat of the	campaign was being worked out at jonesborough thomas on sherman's	instructions ordered slocum now commanding the twentieth corps	to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing	his bridgehead to a counterattack.	8.324195501674389
2554. the dispatch must have been sent	after sundown on september 1.	15.2240254311671
2555. slocum made his reconnaissanace the	next morning found the town empty accepted the surrender of the mayor	and occupied the city a little before noon.	7.645644494845653
2556. on the morning	of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and	the ohio followed the line of hardee's retreat.	12.450587453431643
2557. about noon they	came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy's station and deployed.	11.310071401648727
2558. the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the	enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation	from the balance of the line.	12.559679591915646
2559. that night a note written in	slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman	stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta.	9.017283701514813
2560. before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note	to thomas.	12.624353484610717
2561. in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed	on his heels.	16.36898374995618
2562. the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then making	up his mind that it was genuine snapped his fingers whistled and	almost danced in his exuberance.	10.433775350779067
2563. the next day sherman issued	his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta.	12.491028226781124
2564. the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter	of personal choice.	13.906067214941196
2565. sherman laid great store by place captures.	11.118618003375188
2566. hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors.	11.33819267263277
2567. by	both standards thomas had the right to be proud.	12.212911421410741
2568. thomas thanked	his men for their tenacity of purpose unmurmuring endurance cheerful	obedience brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle.	9.84116829725784
2569. sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well	executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the	larger fruits of victory.	9.743962869590975
2570. he supposed the military world would approve	of his accomplishment.	15.392537383636562
2571. whatever the military world thought	the political world approved it wholeheartedly.	11.953215276360249
2572. for some time despondency	in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways- an	eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln.	11.942780129582685
2573. proposals	were in the air for a year's armistice.	12.882548406924313
2574. lincoln was sure that he would	not be re-elected.	14.992963577913837
2575. in the midst of this gloom at 10:05 pm	on september 2 slocum's telegram to stanton general sherman	has taken atlanta shattered the talk of a negotiated peace	and boosted lincoln into the white house.	9.654418009607152
2576. to the republicans no	victory	could have been more complete.	18.274904490688915
2577. official congratulations	showered upon sherman and his army.	12.082314533655287
2578. lincoln mentioned their distinguished	ability courage and perseverance.	14.435838278425202
2579. he felt that this campaign would	be famous in the annals of war.	13.139539178274877
2580. grant called it prompt skillful	and brilliant.	14.465371900970894
2581. halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war.	12.45082678936125
2582. actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure.	16.515328042219984
2583. next	best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action.	8.62963042412541
2584. sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably	nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy's to atlanta.	9.59651527613549
2585. but so far as its territorial objectives were concerned the campaign	was successful.	15.108810238643821
2586. within the narrow frame of military tactics too	the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant.	12.429735759651042
2587. in seventeen weeks	the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles.	12.75731295991462
2588. there	was a battle on an average of once every three weeks.	15.220123134003023
2589. the skirmishing	was almost constant.	19.440309286487764
2590. in the summary of the principal events of the campaign	compiled from the official records there are only ten days which	show no fighting.	13.96384772589784
2591. the casualties in the army of the cumberland were	22807 while for all three armies they were 37081.	10.846942095252457
2592. men were killed	in their camps at their meals and in their sleep.	12.393309875360785
2593. rifle fire often	kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces.	9.669550099771405
2594. modern warfare	was born in this campaign- periscopes camouflage booby traps land	mines extended order trench raids foxholes armored cars night	attacks flares sharpshooters in trees interlaced vines and treetops	which were the forerunners of barbed wire trip wires to thwart a cavalry	charge which presaged the mine trap and the general use of anesthetics.	8.229643247154815
2595. the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers	began to select tactical points by designating a spot as near the	letter o in the word mountain.	8.809327433028367
2596. a few weeks later the maps were	being divided into squares and a position was described as being about	lots 239 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196.	11.19561925374586
2597. this	system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them	from a mobile lithograph press.	8.62963042412541
2598. orders of the day began to specify the	standard map for the movement.	13.21749732651732
2599. sherman proved that a railway	base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta	campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks.	8.97070345964943
2600. to the rebels it seemed	as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets.	13.141055463067612
2601. the whistle	of sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish	fire.	11.30002322886672
2602. as always the ranks worked out new and better tactics but	there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods	and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their	military thinking.	12.723523402527052
2603. the fossilized formalized precedent-based thinking	of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman's armies.	9.723836223785913
2604. sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old.	10.635267499930531
2605. one of sherman's most serious shortcomings however was	his mistrust of his cavalry.	14.928196931646296
2606. he never saw that it was a complement to	his infantry and not a substitute for it.	18.118086827505902
2607. then in some way this lack	of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging	effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice.	9.830659612403199
2608. a horse	needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with	two pounds.	11.584099000644187
2609. the horseman required eleven times more than the footman.	15.576337315587427
2610. so sherman tried a compromise.	19.854575619435728
2611. he would ship by rail five pounds per	day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could	be picked up off the country.	9.751797058473317
2612. already debilitated	by the chattanooga starvation the quality of sherman's horseflesh	ran downhill as the campaign progressed.	12.257911432525152
2613. every recorded request by	thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time	to take care	of his horses.	7.983647920404994
2614. well led properly organized cavalry	in its complementary role to infantry had four functions.	11.822995480978216
2615. first	it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they were doing and hold	them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over.	7.857619071934909
2616. second	it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy.	11.322822388129964
2617. third	it could threaten at all times and destroy when possible the enemy	communications.	10.415631413044327
2618. it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry	and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot	soldier.	13.014007307483366
2619. its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated	enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign.	9.414117330305572
2620. thomas tried	hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet but his	plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum	mobility and with its commander stripped from it.	10.32029253542393
2621. sherman knew	the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base	with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings.	8.534545373379247
2622. his conception proved	workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean deft well	organized retreats with small materiel losses.	9.704174639530388
2623. sherman insisted that	cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways yet garrard's	covington raid and rousseau's opelika raid cut two-thirds	of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of	what forrest might do to his communications.	7.296402922270087
2624. when mcpherson	pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive	movement the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted	infantry totally inadequate for its role.	9.586368721281987
2625. it stumbled on infantry	where no infantry should have been and mcpherson's aggressive impulse	faded out overwhelmed by fears of the unknown.	10.368076349180209
2626. a proper cavalry	command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into	one division of polk's army of the mississippi moving up from	the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton.	10.931440063388361
2627. from the night	of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry	east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing	the greatest opportunity of his career.	9.19930974323692
2628. a great part of the time	thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line.	0.0
2629. at such	times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike	him.	11.986264669381535
2630. it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making	any disastrous mistakes.	16.355351912848395
2631. heat during the atlanta campaign	coupled with unsuitable clothing caused individual irritation that	was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean	clothing.	8.09077295401769
2632. to relieve the itch and sweat galls the men got into the	water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally	the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private	truce while the men went swimming.	8.738288873456893
2633. johnston believed that sherman put	his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various	fords.	8.450640073948662
2634. lieutenant colonel james p brownlow who commanded the	first brigade of thomas' first cavalry division was ordered across	one of these fords.	9.217960364622167
2635. the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers	across naked- except for guns cartridge boxes and hats.	9.587860805964542
2636. they	kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels drove	the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men.	9.511646382978217
2637. most of	the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff	brush than their naked pursuers.	9.9426454595619
2638. rank was becoming an explosive	issue in all three of sherman's armies.	11.766481243427672
2639. merited recommendations	from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees	from civil life.	10.201914912274288
2640. in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of	meynell thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave	london before this new friendship had developed further:	that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed	by	w m's curious methods of handling me.	11.522438953646207
2641. he never let me know	that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was	to leave for lymington.	10.284833762309004
2642. the result was that i found myself in the	ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for	the next week only two days before my departure from london.	11.72976122456883
2643. luckily	both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion	it was not i.	8.450640073948662
2644. it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not	generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements	which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant.	11.524058856107258
2645. when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which	included fervent verses from pantasaph mrs king felt a proper	victorian alarm.	9.472201140752976
2646. some she knew looked upon thompson almost as a	saint	but others read in the hound of heaven what they took to	be the confessions of a great sinner who like oscar wilde had-	as one pious writer later put it- thrown himself on the swelling	wave of every passion.	8.620522236795336
2647. consequently on october 31 1896	mrs king wrote to thompson quite against her daughter's wishes	asking him not to recommence a correspondence which i believe	has been dropped for some weeks.	7.841587112331692
2648. katherine was staying at a convent	and her mother felt that as thompson himself seems to have suggested	she might eventually stay there.	10.699643861050424
2649. this prospect did not please mrs	king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might	marry a bohemian but she used it to suggest to thompson that	it	is not in her nature to love you.	8.194315249184973
2650. for his part thompson	had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an	honorable friendship between katie and himself.	14.206178300684602
2651. at no time does he	seem to have proposed marriage and mrs king was evidently torn between	a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe	that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation.	8.54503129984497
2652. in any case she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might	not see katie again now that this frank explanation has been made	+ no one can misunderstand.	11.858581050663071
2653. she ended her letter with the assurance	that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself	to be an honor from which she could not part without still more pain.	8.147217654418075
2654. after thompson came to london to live he received a	letter from katie which was dated february 8 1897.	10.747094446632895
2655. she regretted	what she described as the unwarrantable + unnecessary check to their	friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another	perfectly.	9.853018491177032
2656. this letter concluded with an invitation:   i	am a great deal at the little children's hospital.	13.757017558606131
2657. mr meynell	knows the way.	18.451180708689456
2658. i know you are very busy now you are writing a great	deal + your book is coming out isn't it?	11.573732397990986
2659.  but if you are able + care	to come you know how glad i shall be.	16.044374908264373
2660. ever yours sincerely	katherine douglas king the invitation was accepted and	other letters followed in which she spoke of her concern for his health	and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled	children she served.	9.19152043385147
2661. it is difficult to say what thompson expected	would come of their relationship which had begun so soon after his emotions	had been stirred by maggie brien but when katie wrote on april	11 1900 to tell him that she was to be married to the rev godfrey	burr the vicar of rushall in staffordshire the news evidently	helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes	for a new volume of verse.	9.104045594913151
2662. in a letter to meynell which was written	in june less than a month before katie's wedding he was highly	melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of	returning to the life of the streets:   a week in arrears	and without means to pay i must go it is the only right thing.	12.562599758708622
2663. h	perhaps mrs meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep	my own copy of the first edition of my first book with all its mementos	of her and the dear ones.	8.219552744138676
2664. h last not least there are some poems	which k king sent me when i was preparing	a fresh volume asking me to include them.	11.461202662441773
2665. the terrible blow of	the new year put an end to that project.	13.032656681178958
2666. i wish you would return them	to her.	20.784332810908136
2667. i have not the heart.	31.792921000739714
2668. h i never had the courage to look	at them when my projected volume became hopeless fearing they were	poor until now when i was obliged to do so.	11.266462562375448
2669. h o my genius young	and ripening you would swear- when i wrote them; and now!	what has it all come to?	8.432437128115627
2670.  all chance of fulfilling my destiny is	over.	16.360431583194977
2671. h i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems dear	father-brother now i am gone; and launch them on the world when their	time comes.	10.433809526629206
2672. for them a box will be lodgment enough.	17.091005821301067
2673. h katie cannot	mind your seeing them now; since my silence must have ended when	i gave the purposed volume to you.	8.432437128115627
2674. h i ask you to do me the last	favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening about which time i shall	come to say my sad good-bye.	9.941295055464995
2675. if you don't think much of them tell	me the wholesome truth.	10.012261231777774
2676. if otherwise you will give me a pleasure.	18.511258451243947
2677. o wilfrid! it is strange; but this- yes terrible step i	am about to take h is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found	hope that here in these poems is treasure- or at least some	measure of beauty which i did not know of.	8.4525100212592
2678. h thompson of	course	was persuaded not to take the terrible step; meynell once	again paid his debts and it was katie rather than thompson whose	life was soon ended for she died in childbirth in april 1901 in	the first year of her marriage.	9.305166338840618
2679. the orphaned poems mentioned	in the letter to meynell comprised a group of five sonnets which	were published in the 1913 edition of thompson's works under the	heading ad amicam plus certain other completed pieces and rough	drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books.	8.781805583276752
2680. the	publication of father connolly's the man has wings has made	more of the group available in print so that a general picture of	what it contained can now be had without difficulty.	10.089569826270711
2681. some of the poems	express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love; others suggest its	coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final	separation.	9.747468263425674
2682. the somewhat petrarchan love story which these	poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more	than a little of autobiographical sincerity.	10.929099699290084
2683. when they were first	written there was evidently no thought of their being published and	those which refer to the writer's love for mrs meynell particularly	have the ring of truth.	9.722460851086879
2684. in my song's young virgin date	for example thompson wrote: yea she that had my song's	young virgin date not now alas that noble singular she i nobler	hold though marred from her once state than others in their best integrity.	9.10658566482682
2685. my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond and thereof shall	the ending not have end: but not for me that loved her to be	fond lightly to please me with a newer friend.	7.776553204804527
2686. then hold it more than	bravest-feathered song that i affirm to thee with heart of pride	i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up true friend	by thy true side; whose absence dearer comfort is by far than	presences of other women are!   taking into account thompson's	capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish	to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known	unhappy loves there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for	katie king.	8.795686850863948
2687. that she was affected by his protestations seems obvious	but since she was evidently a sensible young woman- as well as	an outgoing and sympathetic type- it would seem that for her the word	friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that	which thompson gave it.	8.033308560628805
2688. from the outset she must have realized that	marriage with him was out of the question and although she was displeased	by the unwarrantable interference it seems probable that	she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was perhaps	a man most fitted to live + die solitary + in the love	only of the highest lover.	9.582179466069084
2689. the poems which were addressed	to her while they are far more restrained than those of love in	dian's lap show no great technical advance over those of the narrow	vessel group and are if anything somewhat more labored.	9.01201027801625
2690. their interest remains chiefly biographical for they throw some light	on the utter despair which overtook thompson in the spring and early	summer of 1900.	10.006676861076063
2691. whether or not danchin is correct in suggesting	that thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from	this period is of course a matter of conjecture.	10.39992147568079
2692. reid simply states	without offering any supporting evidence that after he returned	to london he resumed his draughts of laudanum and continued this	right up to his death.	8.700181695682264
2693. there is every reason to recognize that in	the very last years of his life as we shall see thompson did take	the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness	but the exact date at which this began has never been determined.	10.312341275748569
2694. if	as reid says nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not	taking opium there may be some reason to doubt that he was under	its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the	poems to katie king and making plans for another book of verse.	9.860448011920925
2695. in	any event the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that	if he was taking laudanum it was never in command of him to the extent	that it had been during his vagrant years.	8.073714894244704
2696. meynell's remedy	for thompson's despondent mood was typically practical.	12.3482207866056
2697. he simply	found more work for him to do and the articles and reviews continued	without an evident break.	12.346257209466518
2698. as a reviewer thompson	generally displayed a judicious attitude.	20.05049390641832
2699. that he read some	of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from	his notes which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable	basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without	his signature.	8.461081708104755
2700. on the basis of this careful reading thompson frequently	gave a clear complete and interesting description of a prose work	or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry.	12.115217173199575
2701. he was seldom an unmethodical critic and his reviews generally	followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work	contained a treatment of the things that had especially interested him	in it and wherever possible a balancing of whatever artistic merits	and faults he might have found.	10.434585862380098
2702. it was of course in this	drawing	of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire	to do full justice to an author.	14.196741618501258
2703. reviewing davidson's the	testament of an empire builder for example thompson found	that	there was too much metrical dialectic.	8.674775649767593
2704. poetry he said must be	dogmatic: it must not stoop to argue like a kc in	cloth-of-gold.	12.166521691620998
2705. yet davidson impressed him as a poet capable of sustained	power passion or beauty and he cited specific passages	to illustrate not only these qualities but davidson's command of	imagery as well.	8.175813438070053
2706. similarly he wrote that laurence housman had a too	deliberate manner as well as a lack of inevitable felicity	in diction.	13.48919136860642
2707. but he admired housman's subtle intellectuality	and delighted in the inversion by which divine love becomes the most	fatal allurement in love the tempter.	9.848992415240495
2708. of course	there were books about which nothing good could be said.	13.955530871927225
2709. understanding	as he did the difficulty of the art of poetry and believing	that the only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of	poets he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please	when it came to the review of a book of verse.	8.72513664271655
2710. as he had done on his first imperial sortie a year and a half	before lewis trekked southeast through red russia to kamieniec.	13.599231809097668
2711. thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into podolia	and nogay tartary or the yedisan.	8.804937724103095
2712. there along the east bank	of the southern bug opposite the hamlet of zhitzhakli a few miles	north of the black sea he arrived at general headquarters of the	russian army.	10.186648517685688
2713. by june 19 1788 he had presented himself to its commander	in chief the governor of the southern provinces the director	of the war college- the prince.	9.070899602262553
2714. catherine's first	war against the grand turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty	quite favorable to her.	9.559225930701576
2715. by 1783 her legions had managed to annex the	crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now in this second combat with	the crescent were aiming at suzerainty over all of the black sea's	northern shoreline.	8.2203934117302
2716. through most of 1787 operations on	both sides had been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove	decisive though many of their details are obscure.	10.706572256517342
2717. to consolidate what	her navy had won the czarina was fortunate that for the first	time in russian history her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command	under her favorite giaour.	8.537536585098662
2718. potemkin was directing this conflict	on three fronts: in the caucasus; along the danube and among the	carpathians in alliance with the emperor joseph's armies; and	in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of nogay tartary	and taurida including the crimean peninsula.	8.027454875492761
2719. here the war would	flame to its focus and here lewis littlepage had come.	11.837496042209333
2720. potemkin's	army of ekaterinoslav totaling it was claimed 40000 regular	troops and 6000 irregulars of the cossack corps had invested	islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the black sea	the fortress town of oczakov and was preparing to test the turk by	land and sea.	8.76423350108279
2721. during a sojourn of slightly more than three months chamberlain	littlepage sould see action on both elements.	12.409772751073543
2722. as his	second in command the prince had marshal repnin one-time ambassador	to poland.	13.272561156634007
2723. repnin who had a rather narrow face longish nose	high forehead and arching brows looked like a quizzical mephistopheles.	9.247794412294153
2724. some people thought he lacked both ability and character but	most	agreed that he was noble in appearance and for a russian humane.	12.289748445550496
2725. the marshal came to know littlepage quite well.	12.98623016976681
2726. at general headquarters	the newcomer in turn got to know others.	16.134450799270336
2727. there was the neapolitan	ribas a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith	but who had fawned his way up the ladder of catherine's and potemkin's	favor till he was now a brigadier	designated to do in czar paul 1 after traveling all the	way	.	9.55522957861761
2728. then there were	the distinguished foreign volunteers.	25.412385554687706
2729. representing the emperor were	the prince de ligne still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and	general the count pallavicini founder of the austrian branch of	that celebrated italian house a courtier littlepage could have met	at madrid in december 1780.	7.081427551640685
2730. from milan came the young chevalier	de litta an officer in the service of malta.	13.7607091174927
2731. out of saxony rode	the prince of anhalt-bernburg one of the czarina's cousins and	a lieutenant general in her armies a frank sensitive popular soldier	whose kindnesses littlepage would always recall with the sincerest	gratitude.	8.91365808038838
2732. though catherine was vexed at the number of	french officers streaming to the turkish standard there were several	under her own such as the prince de nassau; the energetic parisian	roger de damas three year's littlepage's junior to whom	nassau had taken a liking; and the artillerist colonel prevost	whom the count de segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills	to nassau.	8.49519207420438
2733. england contributed a young subaltern named newton and	the naval architect samuel bentham brother to the economist who far	his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the russian fleet.	7.5926381151963716
2734. from america were the messrs littlepage and jones.	15.480930123407937
2735. lewis had expected to report at once to jones's and nassau's naval	command post.	9.890828909542138
2736. on arrival at headquarters he had however- in king	stanislas' words to glayre- found such favor with pe	potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want	him to go join paul jones h.	9.119579151699211
2737. so of course he stayed put.	16.67615125611056
2738. having	done so he began to experience all the frustrations of others who	attempted to get along with serenissimus and do a job at the same	time.	10.20715283698753
2739. the prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous	but these qualities were sapped by an oriental lethargy and	a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions.	8.002376995614425
2740. at headquarters-	sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally	that you were in a war- lewis found that the commander	in chief's only desk was his knees.	11.017512598428153
2741. an entire theater had been set up for his diversion with a 200-man	italian orchestra under the well-known sarti.	10.658884867120577
2742. in the great one's	personal quarters a portable house almost every evening saw an elegant	banquet or reception.	13.672657329228338
2743. lewis could let his eye caress the prince's	divan covered with a rose-pink and silver turkish cloth or admire	the lovely tapis interwoven with gold that spread across the floor.	7.438203931769883
2744. filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of araby.	12.3482207866056
2745. around the	billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals.	12.907371736737034
2746. at dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red	capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers marching in	pairs like guards from a stage tragedy.	9.454828512626236
2747. among the visitors arriving	every now and then there were of course women.	15.801334955068116
2748. for if serenissimus	made the sign of the cross with his right hand and meant it	with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his	eye.	10.288204946948337
2749. usually lewis would find at headquarters one or more of the	prince's various nieces.	13.276619449355914
2750. right now he found sophie de witt	that magnificent young matron he had spotted at kamieniec fours years	ago.	10.22326357280665
2751. the prince took her with him on every tour around the area	and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of constantinople	as part of his espionage network.	8.699322914397344
2752. one evening he passed around the banquet	table a crystal cup full of diamonds requesting every female guest	to select one as a souvenir.	10.16753433340563
2753. when a lady chanced to soil a pair of	evening slippers brigadier bauer was dispatched to paris for replacements.	10.205942864180706
2754. but if the prince fancied women and was fascinated	by foreigners he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates.	14.188744934529476
2755. he had collared one of his generals in public.	17.389932556468768
2756. his coat trimmed	in sable diamond stars of the orders of saints andrew or george agleam	he was often prone to sit sulkily eye downcast in a scheherazade	trance.	9.036556857969648
2757. when this happened everything stopped.	22.8294315555883
2758. as littlepage	noted: a complete picture of prince potemkin may be had in his	1788 operations.	15.271880129734882
2759. he stays inactive for half the summer in front of oczakov	a quite second-rate spot begins to besiege it formally only	during the autumn rains and finally carries it by assault in	the heart of winter.	8.354953173538773
2760. there's a man who never goes by the ordinary road	but still arrives at his goal who gratuitously gets himself into	difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat in a word a man who creates	monsters for himself in order to appear a hercules in destroying	them.	9.948967353404676
2761. to help him do so the prince had conferred control	of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost	every respect save one: both were eccentrics of the purest ray	serene.	8.743819573223105
2762. alexander vasilievitch suvorov now in his fifty-ninth	year was a thin worn-faced person	of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany.	9.459069973880169
2763. he	had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side a large flat nose	and penetrating blue eyes.	8.439040513341935
2764. his gray hair was thin his face beginning	to attract a swarm of wrinkles.	11.579316589493398
2765. but suvorov's face	was also a theater of vivacity and his tough stooping little frame	was briskness embodied.	10.086477822409448
2766. like all russians he was an emotional man	and in him the emotions warred.	13.379906255313474
2767. kind by nature he never refused charity	to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it	.	8.653641484999548
2768. but he was perpetually engaged in a battle to	command his own temper.	21.064895765923048
2769. when littlepage was introduced if the	general behaved as usual the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries:	origin?	9.631512151475675
2770.  age?	28.49691246350829
2771.  mission?	24.303019953065355
2772.  current status?	22.4402793574494
2773.  woe betide the	interviewee if he answered vaguely.	11.118618003375188
2774. suvorov's contempt for don't-know's	was proverbial; better to give an asinine answer than none	at all.	10.315020659416891
2775. despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier he slept on a	pile of hay with his cloak as blanket.	7.9139724503302755
2776. he rose at 4:00 am the	year round and	was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake	his men.	10.581383043688653
2777. his breakfast was tea; his dinner fell anywhere from nine	to noon; his supper was nothing.	9.08975369331655
2778. he hadn't worn a watch or carried	pocket money for years because he disliked both but highest among	his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's	grasp and smashed it to smithereens.	9.056404554382043
2779. he kept several pet birds	and liked cats well enough that if one crept by he would mew at it in	friendly fashion.	9.124275094633918
2780. passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark.	14.475204886974879
2781. yet general suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing his adored	czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities- was mad	only north northwest.	8.28982856856491
2782. he had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity	allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at court; in	camp he knew it won you the affection of your men.	12.253402812393318
2783. he had accordingly	cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature.	20.85240225430984
2784. underneath he	remained one of the best-educated russians of his day.	13.463323954570695
2785. he dabbled	in verse could get along well among most of the european languages	and was fluent in french and german.	10.108228735041012
2786. he had also mastered the cossack	tongue.	24.720066299040205
2787. for those little men with the short whiskers shaven	polls and top knots suvorov reserved a special esteem.	11.249218081035549
2788. potemkin-	as king stanislas knew and presently informed littlepage- looked	on the cossacks as geopolitical tools.	10.11881746645696
2789. to serenissimus such tribes	as the cossacks of the don or those ex-bandits the zaporogian	cossacks	were just	elements for enforced resettlement in say bessarabia where as	the faithful of the black sea borders he could use their presence	as baragining points in the czarina's territorial claims against	turkey.	7.488163926662089
2790. suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic	units but military men of a high potential.	10.410910470331205
2791. he knew how to	channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere	plunderers into a-1 guerrilla	fighters.	12.08435042948653
2792. he always kept a few on his	personal staff.	16.477994707361407
2793. he often donned their tribal costumes such as the	one featuring a tall black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled	a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels;	broad red stripes down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round	the waist holding cartridges and light sabre.	8.333088830009498
2794. suvorov played parent	not just to his cossacks but to all his troops.	11.044881341185611
2795. it was probably at	this period that littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary	russian soldier.	14.103468815923064
2796. these illiterate boors conscripted from villages	all across the czarina's empire had suvorov may have told lewis	just two things a commander could count on: physical fitness and	personal courage.	9.051347551661426
2797. when their levies came shambling into camp they	were all elbows hair and beard.	10.854566499634112
2798. they emerged as interchangeable cogs	in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked hair queued	greatcoated jackbooted and best of all- in the opinion of the	british professional major semple-lisle- their minds are not	estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge	which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny.	9.080702159829075
2799. mando pleading her cause must have said that dr brown was the	most distinguished physician in the united states of america for	our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating	the irregularity of his pulse.	9.48172764217764
2800. he's got high blood pressure too	and bum kidneys the doctor said to me.	7.557670718506126
2801. transparent look waxy	skin- could well be uremia.	11.118618003375188
2802. he looked disapprovingly at an ash	tray piled high with cigarette stubs shook his head and moved his	hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture.	11.330456768506536
2803. the little official	hung his head in shame.	15.545980247778028
2804. seeing this his colleague at the next desk	gave a short contemptuous laugh pushed forward his own ash tray innocent	of a single butt thumped his chest to show his excellent condition	and looked proud.	8.751869277968913
2805. the doctor gravely nodded approval.	16.994033841028205
2806. at this moment mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem	was solved and all norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers.	13.152352256967104
2807. we	went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents	and more officials awaited us the rest of the office personnel hot	upon our heels.	10.870399618242502
2808. by this time word had got around that an american doctor	was on the premises.	14.744422111605767
2809. one fellow who had liver spots held out his	hands to the great healer.	12.079763985172011
2810. it was funny but it was also touching.	28.412114600073288
2811. you	know norton said to me later i am thinking of setting	up the klinico brownapopolus.	8.62963042412541
2812. i might not make any money but i'd	sure have patients.	17.47823933110066
2813. after luncheon we took advantage of	the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our	dear friend deppy had written.	11.45952817048654
2814. deppy is despina messinesi a long-time	member of the vogue staff who although born in boston was	born there	of greek parents.	9.279660741389986
2815. several years of her life have been spent in	the homeland and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming.	9.48646215498247
2816. all you have to do ilka dear is to phone on your arrival.	16.494700166939765
2817. they are longing to see you.	19.23144912003902
2818. the wear and tear of life have taught	me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers	but i planned on being the soul of tact of giving them plenty	of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already	running over without us.	8.331121844827363
2819. greek phone service	is worse than french so that it was to be some little time before	contact of any sort was established.	12.503460322415489
2820. in the late afternoon	mando came back to fetch us and we drove to the acropolis.	16.992394502386112
2821. we stopped	first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned	by the parthenon.	11.317105477269774
2822. the curving benches are broken chipped tumbled	but still in place as are the marble chairs the seats of honor	for the legislators.	10.583645395798467
2823. the carved statues of the frieze against the low	wall are for the most part headless but their exquisitely graceful nude	and draped torsos and the kneeling atlantes are well preserved in	their perfect proportion.	8.679347299613594
2824. having completed our camera work we	started our climb.	13.686310978453044
2825. i suppose the same emotion holds if to a lesser	degree with any famous monument.	11.948354425929253
2826. will it live up to its reputation?	17.74519210370589
2827. 	the weight of fame and history is formidable and dreary steel engravings	in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination.	8.148416695723306
2828. uh	huh we think looking at them so that's the parthenon.	11.33819267263277
2829. and then	perhaps one day we get to athens.	13.470826472801345
2830. we are here! we've come a	long way and spent a lot of money.	15.76451162650211
2831. it had better be good.	29.052373146529394
2832. don't worry	about the acropolis.	5.918066007980199
2833. probably every visitor	has a favorite time for his first sight of it.	10.177940597236498
2834. we saw it frequently	afterward but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset.	13.408199996827788
2835. the light at that time is a benediction.	0.0
2836. the serene majestic	columns of the parthenon tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky	frame incredible vistas.	10.775365892393362
2837. all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly	and look and look and look.	10.992161120727493
2838. more than twenty-four hundred	years old bruised battered worn and partially destroyed combining	to an astounding degree solidity and grace it still stands incomparable	testimony to man's aspiration.	10.830626008576768
2839. in 1687 the turks who had been	in control of the city since the fifteenth century with a truly shattering	lack of prudence used the parthenon as a powder magazine.	9.808716874114182
2840. it	was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding venetian army and the great	central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens.	11.071197092408783
2841. nearby	is the temple of athena.	15.711686594984478
2842. the architectural feature the caryatides	upholding the portico famous around the world as the porch of the	maidens was referred to airily by mando as the girls' place.	11.122508657644616
2843. another beautiful building is the propylaea the entrance gate of the	acropolis.	10.055871418319004
2844. my other nugget of art and architectural knowledge-	besides remembering that it was ghiberti who designed the doors	of the baptistery in florence- is the three styles of greek columns.	10.2643013366671
2845. for some happy reason doric ionic and corinthian have always	stuck in my mind.	11.687236174625477
2846. furthermore i can identify each design.	15.169483072462453
2847. it remained	however for mando to teach me that doric symbolized strength	ionic wisdom and corinthian beauty the three pillars of the ancient	world.	9.556210036518518
2848. the columns of the parthenon are fluted doric.	15.886427110452118
2849. another	classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry	in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes who was patrolling	up and down in front of the palace.	8.301267155942769
2850. gun on shoulder he would	march smartly for a few yards bring his heels together with a click	make a brisk pirouette skirts flaring and march back to his point	of departure.	9.77160947972379
2851. we did not dare speak to so exalted a being but norton	aimed his camera and shot him so to speak on the rise the split second	between the halt and the turn.	9.006462456464108
2852. the evening of our first	day we drove with christopher and judy sakellariadis who were friends	and patients of norton to dine at a restaurant on the shores of	the aegean.	9.959888811043692
2853. on the way out mr sakellariadis detoured up a special	hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the acropolis lighted	by night.	12.316762419234628
2854. the great spectacle was a source of rancor and	son et lumiere which the french were trying to promote with the	athenians	was the reason.	11.171499679475245
2855. these performances were being staged at historical	monuments throughout europe.	11.481684463108646
2856. by a combination of music lighting	effects and narration famous events that have transpired in	these	locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to	considerable acclaim.	10.430625056136073
2857. the acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment	too but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full	moon when the athenians themselves out of respect for the natural beauty	of the occasion were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination.	10.773744340158633
2858. athenian society was split into two factions the philistines	and the artists.	10.957705180640192
2859. the artists contended that the philistines	gross of soul were all for having son et lumiere since the	french were footing the bill and the attraction wherever it had been	done had proven popular.	7.9505206526631165
2860. this was the crassest kind of materialism	and they the artists would have no truck with it.	13.808221409777675
2861. the acropolis	was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight	wasn't enough for both natives and tourists then they were quite	simply barbarians	and the hell with them.	9.791365533504354
2862. the restaurant to which the sakellariadises took us on this night	of controversy was the asteria on asteria beach.	11.444928892472209
2863. this is a public	bathing beach easily accessible by tramway from the center of athens.	17.059910528743575
2864. office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during	the siesta period which during the summer lasts from two until five	in the afternoon when shops and offices are again open for business.	8.41419628466499
2865. they close sometime after eight.	18.05761634156354
2866. nine o'clock is the rush hour	when the busses are jammed and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning	to fill.	10.566627304921582
2867. bedtime is late for the balmy evenings are delightful	and everyone wants to linger under the stars.	8.29272515769823
2868. the sand is fine	and pleasant the cabanas are clean and the parasols green raspberry	and butter yellow are very gay.	10.351870993004653
2869. although open to the general	public it is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive	private beach club at home.	11.77848078064876
2870. we went there a couple of times to swim	and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.	15.118391847630344
2871. this agreeable state of affairs is	explicable i think on two counts.	11.809189563457334
2872. one is greece is not yet suffering	from overpopulation.	21.111503845347045
2873. the public may still find pleasure in public	places.	14.738694869789436
2874. the other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols though	modest from an american point of view still is a little high for	many athenians.	13.60264667723062
2875. we were struck by the notable absence of banana skins	and beer cans but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on greek	refinement perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable	radios.	9.45624941900416
2876. greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll and the stations	most tuned to are those carrying united states overseas programs.	9.399530544179635
2877. a good deal of english was spoken on the beach most educated greeks	learn it in childhood and there were also american wives and	children of our overseas servicemen.	10.624892852798625
2878. for a delightful drive out	of athens i should recommend sounion at the end of the attic peninsula.	17.38975882064304
2879. the road a comparatively new one is very good winding along	inlets coves and bays of deep and brilliant blue.	10.478201307720825
2880. i suppose the	day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments	but at present it is deserted and seductive.	14.631961463368956
2881. three beneficial	hurdles to progress are the lack of water electricity and telephones.	11.735257574549713
2882. at sounion there is a group of beautiful columns the ruins	of a temple to poseidon of particular interest at that time as active	reconstruction was in progress.	0.0
2883. gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins	and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet	in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to	match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original.	8.870072720215468
2884. later they	would be hoisted into place.	17.098503640612876
2885. there is a mediocre restaurant at	sounion and i fed a thin little grecian cat and gave it two saucers	of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as though it were	nectar.	11.004934706262233
2886. i think its thirst had never been assuaged before.	21.913457114200188
2887. norton	and i dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in piraeus right	on the water's edge.	9.281239664551435
2888. to enter it you go down five or six steps	from the road.	13.666965797336012
2889. across the road is the kitchen and waiters bearing great	trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their french colleagues	at the restaurant in the place du tertre in paris.	8.105052395032384
2890. this restaurant	too had a cat a dusty thin little creature.	13.882468763207669
2891. how can	a cat be thin in a fish restaurant?	12.249135835895233
2892.  but this one was.	34.66998142771101
2893. when offered	a morsel it glanced right and left and winced obviously frightened	and expecting a kick but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit.	8.836501579440675
2894. greece	was one of the highlights of our trip but beginning in greece and continuing	around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of	animals was horrifying ranging from callous indifference to active	cruelty.	9.207087497164656
2895. this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated	people we met who loved their pets but kindness is not a basic human	instinct.	10.966565501397442
2896. we met some charming athenians and among them our	chauffeur panyotis ranked high.	13.159639405307706
2897. his english was limited and the	little he knew he found irritating.	12.764804707432509
2898. a particularly galling phrase was	ok panyotis we have time at our disposal.	12.088674315894618
2899. this he	claimed was the favorite refrain of the english.	12.508271769542546
2900. they would be lolling	under a tree sipping ouzo relishing the leisurely life assuring	him that the day was yet young.	12.544184641465252
2901. let him become honest and they discard him.	13.925458071956976
2902. but let him be ready	to invent whatever falsehood- to assail whatever character- and	to prostitute his paper to whatever ends- and they hug him to their	heart.	10.258200825287815
2903. in proportion to the degradation of his moral worth is the	increase of his worth to them.	12.726748272275202
2904. to exonerate the legislature	and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation pike took another	course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked.	10.280547817881835
2905. he	claimed in his attacks that woodruff with scurrilous underhandedness	had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the	honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract	without knowing what they were doing.	8.523020795283648
2906. the charge was so farfetched	that woodruff paid little attention to it and answered pike	in a rather bored way wearily declaring that a new hand was	pumping the bellows of the crittenden organ and concluding: in	a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles	even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels.	8.643134285775787
2907. the game	is not worth the ammunition it would cost.	12.204673387645432
2908. we therefore leave the writer	to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse	he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd	to which he belongs.	10.164049577737849
2909. despite woodruff's continuing refusal	to debate with pike through the columns of his newspaper pike	did not let up his attack for a moment.	8.411433297977096
2910. over the months he became a	political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing	woodruff the casca letters belittling woodruff and long	analytical articles vilifying woodruff.	10.227354529583744
2911. so persistent were these attacks	that in march of the following year woodruff was finally moved	to action and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics	the subtle art of diversion.	8.048413775512053
2912. to attack pike directly would	gain woodruff little for as a penniless newcomer pike had nothing	to lose.	11.123278405325484
2913. by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a	man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a towering rage	if his integrity were questioned and who would be anxious to avenge himself.	8.77303081766422
2914. pike's honor would now come under attack but not by woodruff	himself.	12.018684762255377
2915. the charges would be made in the gazette by an anonymous	correspondent and pike would be so busy trying to track down the	illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing woodruff.	9.921899891757805
2916. pike was stunned by the	first blast against his character which was published in the march	4th issue of the gazette under the name vale.	9.547169818310373
2917. the anonymous	correspondent did not resort to innuendoes.	13.974661317959146
2918. he called pike a thief.	26.063992072374287
2919. he said pike had stolen mules from harris during the santa fe	expedition; he accused pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career	in arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in van buren.	8.674119147872076
2920. the	charges caught pike off balance coming as they did from an unexpected	quarter.	13.106013906898205
2921. outraged he used the advocate of march 7th for a	denial sending immediately to santa fe and van buren for documents	to vindicate himself and demanding that woodruff reveal the name	of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym.	6.846053805346686
2922. woodruff said nothing and pike frustrated stormed	throughout little rock in an unsuccessful search for vale	asking	his friends to keep their ears open.	9.246511219122162
2923. finally he learned through	the grapevine that the culprit might be one james w robinson in	pope county.	9.836262332939121
2924. without further inquiry pike jumped to the conclusion	that robinson was guilty and following the honorable route that	would	eventually lead to the dueling ground sent a message to robinson	through his friends demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity.	8.931722426090712
2925. to pike silence was tantamount to an	admission of guilt and he determined to get robinson onto the dueling	ground at all costs.	8.595769944484713
2926. on april 11th he wrote an open letter in the	advocate making it known to the world that jas w robinson	is by his own admission a base liar and a slanderer.	12.404286443453007
2927. if robinson was a liar and a slanderer he was also	a very canny gentleman for nothing that pike could do would pry so	much as a single word out of him.	8.068875963276275
2928. preoccupied with his own defense and	his attempts to get robinson to fight pike lessened his attacks	on woodruff and finally stopped them altogether.	9.602901440008164
2929. and pike never did	find out if robinson was really responsible for the vale letter.	12.041487402705556
2930. woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful.	13.915190642667962
2931. it	took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done and it had	a profound effect on him.	10.819980857009613
2932. once he learned a lesson he never forgot it.	14.57399511046188
2933. in the next few months of comparative silence pike waited patiently	until conditions were perfect for a new attack and then displaying	a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting gained	from his first bout with woodruff he used these changed conditions	to excellent advantage.	9.961976472842743
2934. shortly after the vale incident	a rift began to develop between william woodruff and governor pope.	12.312875875664648
2935. one-armed gruff frugally honest governor pope had been the	ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the disgraceful antics of	political bosses like crittenden and he ruled the state with an iron	fist tolerating no nonsense.	7.486257676092319
2936. woodruff had supported him all the way	both as a chief executive and as a man.	11.716961038939338
2937. besides being political allies	they were also friends.	12.621389090062989
2938. this warm relationship came to an abrupt	end in june of 1834 when the national congress appropriated $3000	for compiling and printing the laws of arkansas territory and	taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature left	it to the governor to award the contract.	9.813649509946552
2939. woodruff wanted this	political windfall very badly and everyone assumed that he would get	it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter.	11.379198037017186
2940. after all woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was	the logical man for the job.	13.560105857509901
2941. but because the governor was determined	that friendship should not influence him one way or the other he looked	for a printer with a knowledge of the law	and awarded the contract to a lawyer named john steele who	had started a newspaper in helena the year before.	9.627806224826449
2942. considering the governor's act a personal rebuff he aired	his feelings in the gazette on august 26 1834: we think	the governor treated us rather shabbily to say the least of it.	8.686275759018516
2943. h	it is but justice to mr steele for us to add that in the above	remarks nothing is intended to his disparagement either as a lawyer	or as a printer.	8.885826193066896
2944. he got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his	good luck.	14.475754096609295
2945. we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle	him to credit.	19.893320814964515
2946. as summer cooled into fall and winter	even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder	by the day and by december of 1834 it was icy.	12.154041120480466
2947. it was at this point	that pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two	men.	14.283027744957476
2948. the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract	that woodruff still held.	11.763328745489208
2949. from his first bout with the	canny woodruff pike had learned that it was better not to attack him	directly so harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too	high he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs	to exist.	8.99658541236074
2950. to document his charge pike set up two parallel columns	in the advocate showing the price charged by the gazette and	the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere.	10.383644484822918
2951. then he called on the governor to explain why.	15.359440537073167
2952. the governor	was not used to having his integrity questioned and he promptly	passed the charges on to woodruff demanding that woodruff answer them.	9.861026361047744
2953. if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor	insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in	the advocate.	9.381621093504517
2954. woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma.	11.33819267263277
2955. as a proud man his prestige would suffer if he let pike dictate	to him through the governor's office but to lower his prices would	be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first	place.	8.90079311463323
2956. as a consequence he did neither.	25.99723591566198
2957. very angry at woodruff	the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract	withdrawn from the gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder which	by a strange coincidence happened to be pike's advocate.	8.068945856572844
2958. and for the moment at least the governor now found himself allied with	the head of the crittenden faction he had formerly opposed and pike	was credited with a clear triumph over woodruff.	12.757083557316236
2959. but in	the	confused atmosphere of frontier politics alliances were as quickly	broken as they were formed and as pike came to favor with the governor	of the territory the governor fell out of favor with the president	of the united states.	8.983868103713883
2960. on january 28 1835 andrew jackson removed	pope from office and elevated territorial secretary william	s fulton to the position.	11.356952171040305
2961. fulton was a very close friend of jackson	and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the	old days.	11.386406462448855
2962. as a stanch party man and a rabid democrat he had little	tolerance for whigs like pike and pike lost any immediate personal	advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him.	10.454827950853351
2963. as pike proved himself adept in the political arena he also became	a social lion in the village of little rock where he served as a symbol	of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly	to cultivate.	9.027206104636376
2964. after all pike was an established poet and his work	had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of	american culture boston.	11.703870212615021
2965. his accomplishments and the fact that he	was resident did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to	describe little rock after a visit there.	10.060221780434567
2966. for some reason none of	them were impressed with the territorial capital.	15.047761577976582
2967. the internationally	known sportsman and traveler friedrich gersta^cker was typical of	its detractors in the mid-thirties.	9.923610580026844
2968. little rock is a vile detestable	place h.	13.33544557341234
2969. little rock is without any flattery	one of the dullest towns in the united states and i would not have	remained two hours in the place if i had not met with some good friends	who made me forget its dreariness.	10.024316575263597
2970. pike enjoyed his	new social position tremendously and cultivated in himself those traits	necessary to its preservation.	9.908939338115298

3011. then he became involved in a ruckus	remarkably similar to the one in plymouth.	12.593660522763747

3021. roger williams wrote his friend winthrop as follows:   master	gorton having foully abused high and low at aquidneck is now	bewitching and bemaddening poor providence both with his unclean and	foul censures of all the ministers of this country	and also denying all visible	and external ordinances in depth of familism: almost all suck in	his poison as at first they did at aquidneck.	6.705955210984494
3022. some few and myself withstand	his inhabitation and town privileges without confession and	reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at portsmouth; yet	the tide is too strong against us and i fear	it will force me to little patience a little isle next	to your prudence.	8.299797265512884

3025. this town should not be confused with pawtucket just north of providence	or pawcatuck connecticut on the pawcatuck river opposite	westerly rhode island.	9.619056628000578
3026. up to now gorton had been looking	for trouble and now that he was trying to get away from it trouble	started looking for him.	15.755030729420005
3027. upon intelligence that the formidable	agitator was to favor them with his presence the benighted inhabitants	of pawtuxet alas gave their allegiance to massachusetts and asked	that colony to expel the newcomers.	7.517232160932028
3028. as it was the custom of that alert	colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection	this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack	of wolves and saying come and get it.	12.903697464310508
3029. gorton and company	however promptly bought land from miantonomi a few miles south	of pawtuxet extending from the present gaspee point south to warwick	neck and twenty miles inland.	7.979362688670735
3030. the settlement was called shawomet.	19.926638570224114
3031. it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything including	providence and massachusetts.	16.546726547285665
3032. if gorton wanted peace and quiet	for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it.	11.613179452405623
3033. instead	of that he was engulfed by bedlam.	15.536445750746786
3034. pomham and soconoco	a couple of minor sachems	under miantonomi declared that they had never assented to the sale	of land to gorton and had never received anything for it.	9.416459074448511
3035. following	the glorious lead of the heroes of pawtuxet they also submitted themselves	to the protection of massachusetts.	8.355801920451004
3036. one historical authority	presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion	that massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled	gorton.	11.611695903718866
3037. however the general court at boston ordered	the purchasers of shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems'	claim.	11.163710629483402
3038. the purchasers rejected the order in two letters written	in vigorous terms.	12.957840546200554
3039. then massachusetts switched to its standard tactics.	13.726478122166146
3040. it pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters	and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used.	11.37064748204756

3044. at shawomet women	and children fled in terror across the bay.	14.803595429815799
3045. the men fortified a blockhouse	and got ready to fight but meanwhile appealed to the king and	again tried to arbitrate.	10.849206519103445
3046. gorton evidently still had plenty to learn	about massachusetts but he was learning fast.	11.733301422661752
3047. governor winthrop wrote:	you may do well to take notice that besides the title	to land between the english and the indians there there are twelve	of the english that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable	blasphemies who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than	they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration.	7.427418473634292
3048. the attack started on october 2 1643 and the gortonists held	out for a day and a night.	11.948598835825877
3049. the attackers sent for more soldiers and	the defenders to save bloodshed surrendered under the promise that	they would be treated as neighbors.	8.847019011814016
3050. promptly their livestock was taken	and according to gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone	who should utter a word of insolence and run through anyone who	might step out of line.	9.066454657218076
3051. when the captives arrived in boston	the chaplain of their captors went to prayers in the open streets	that the people might take notice what they had done in a holy manner	and in the name of the lord.	9.58490197658589
3052. gorton and ten of his friends	were thrown in jail.	12.62181102088309
3053. on sunday they refused to attend church.	15.498057587789319
3054. the magistrates were determined to compel them.	16.386222825564015
3055. the prisoners agreed	provided they might speak after the sermon which was permitted.	10.61385277229228
3056. here	was gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme.	14.763806894349877
3057. the boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with	torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities but gorton was better.	9.189554574368655
3058. reverend	cotton preached to them about demetrius and the shrines of ephesus.	11.29539260948079
3059. gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation.	10.530932308755343
3060. at the trial which took place later the pomham matter was completely	omitted.	17.301209049836263
3061. the gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried	for their lives.	12.305152356592949
3062. four ecclesiastical questions were presented by the	general court to gorton:  whether the fathers who	died before christ was born of the virgin mary were justified and	saved only by the blood which hee shed and the death which hee suffered	after his incarnation?	9.737010937801518
3063.   whether the only price of our	redemption were not the death of christ on the cross with the rest	of his sufferings and obediences in the time of his life here after	hee was born of the virgin mary?	12.599302596630286
3064.   who was the god whom hee	thinke we serve?	16.498029466632932
3065.   what hee means when hee saith wee worship	the starre of our god remphan chion moloch?	9.924969275548836
3066.    gorton	answered in writing.	18.919390992859817
3067. all of the elders except three voted for death	but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence.	13.022240809451983
3068. seven of the prisoners were sentenced to be confined in irons for as	long as it pleased the court set to work and if they broke jail or proclaimed	heresy to be executed if convicted.	9.716915966451532
3069. the three others got off	easier.	21.134284119893668
3070. the convicts were put in chains paraded before the congregation	at the reverend cotton's lecture as an example and sent to	prisons in various towns where they languished all winter chains included.	9.600810958903212
3071. when fred wheeled him back into his room the big one looking out on	the back porch and put him to bed papa told him he was very tired	but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown.	8.406149194777365
3072. i've been cooped	up so long he added.	7.711699336160625
3073. getting out again seeing old friends	had given his spirits a lift.	10.130076763644453
3074. that night after supper i went	back over to 48 spruce street- ralph and i at that time were living	at 168 chestnut- and ralph went with me.	0.0
3075. papa was still elated	over his afternoon visit downtown.	10.530932308755343
3076. baby i saw a lot of old friends	i hadn't seen in a long time he told me his eyes bright.	14.053020380225963
3077. it was mighty good for the old man to get out again.	21.58200930379781
3078. the	next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent	spirits.	17.386478705186438
3079. but a few days after fred's return he began hemorrhaging	and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration.	14.65439255820663
3080. it	began in the morning and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one.	12.807829747729036
3081. we got dr glenn to him as quickly as we could and we wired	tom of papa's desperate condition.	11.044796755079002
3082. the hemorrhage was in the prostate	region; dr glenn saw at once what had happened.	13.200246697983928
3083. he	has lost much blood he said.	12.048509495279038
3084. it'll take a lot to replace	it.	13.915190642667962
3085. dr glenn i've got a lot of blood fred	spoke up plenty of it.	10.832763902383116
3086. let me give papa blood.	24.51851527405581
3087. the doctor	agreed but explained that it would be necessary first to check fred's	blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as	papa's.	12.142718094488588
3088. to give a patient the wrong type of blood said the doctor	would likely kill him.	12.965313961091072
3089. that was in the days before blood banks	of course and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to	patient.	14.755090113882039
3090. one had to find a donor and usually very quickly whose blood	corresponded with the patient's.	13.576439941724965
3091. and then it took considerably	longer to make preparations for giving transfusions.	12.512054633708269
3092. they had to take	blood samples to the laboratory to test them for one thing and there	was much required preliminary procedure.	13.879810481080897
3093. they made the tests	and came to fred; by now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa	had begun hemorrhaging.	9.012551064066388
3094. fred your blood matches your	father's all right dr glenn said.	11.33819267263277
3095. but we aren't going	to let you give him any.	16.439420077697026
3096. but why in the name of god can't	i give my father blood?	20.206524775820732
3097.  fred demanded.	19.137741945722095
3098. why can't i	doctor?	26.63408569870497
3099.    because fred it could do him no good.	14.383955325070303
3100. he's past helping.	7.860565972560897
3101. he's as good as gone.	7.962925042318041
3102. and in a few minutes papa was dead.	32.95440018806346
3103. it was well past midnight.	30.904122386255487
3104. papa had left us about the same hour of the night that ben had passed	on.	12.351901598683614
3105. the date was june 20 1922.	15.260583014183545
3106. w o wolfe	prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section died shortly	after midnight tuesday at his home 48 spruce street the asheville	times of wednesday june 21 announced.	9.525483112761323
3107. mr wolfe	had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected.	11.868639001208026
3108. funeral services were	held thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home.	13.72541022318608
3109. beloved dr	r f campbell our first presbyterian church pastor was	in charge.	0.0
3110. the burial was out in riverside cemetery.	16.386222825564015
3111. all about him	stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned.	11.204342915251186
3112. a few years before his death papa had agreed with mama to make a	joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of	the	death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children	whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash.	12.49315428743754
3113. at his death	fred and ralph my husband were named executors of the estate under	the terms of the will.	10.48583633200884
3114. fred and ralph qualified as executors	and paid off what debts were currently due and they were all current	since papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid.	8.869467219217677
3115. the bills	were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the	last years of his life and when he died he owed in the main only current	doctor's bills.	10.640838201286389
3116. after they had paid all his debts and the funeral	costs ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars as i remember	with which to pay the bequests.	10.400376092962606
3117. this manifestly would not	provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children.	12.381554748222241
3118. so what	fred and ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking	into account what each of the five had received if anything from	the estate before papa's death.	10.73993669407114
3119. consequently fred and tom the	two who had been provided college educations signed statements to the	effect that each had received his bequest in full and effie and i	were each allotted $5000.	7.761850186643159
3120. frank had been given about half his legacy	to use in a business venture before papa's death; he was given the	difference between that amount and $5000.	9.718300940908714
3121. tom had received four years	of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard	and fred had been in and out of georgia tech and carneigie	tech and part of the time had been a self-help student.	11.920595004640914
3122. so because	he had received less than tom it was felt proper that fred should receive	the few hundred dollars that remained.	10.657780126463992
3123. and that's how papa's	estate was divided.	10.19044397798569
3124. papa i should emphasize had been an	invalid the last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor	bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving	little except	small rentals on some properties he still owned.	8.29233936300038
3125. had	he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism i'm convinced	papa would have left a sizable estate.	9.2098240325416
3126. but he had succeeded well	we agreed.	33.29430195757378
3127. he had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands	and stocks and bonds.	11.052932230987146
3128. for years papa and mama had been large	taxpayers.	17.59727178315997
3129. i recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800.	13.722719440649124
3130. in those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates that	payment represented ownership of much property.	14.048379389301676
3131. merciful god	julia! i have known papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill	we're going to the dogs!   but he never expected to	do that.	7.822411620371612
3132. and he didn't by a long shot!	in the spring	of his second year at harvard tom had been offered a job at northwestern	university as an instructor in the english department.	8.840415204607707
3133. but	he had delayed accepting this job and as he was leaving to come home	to papa in response to our telegram he dropped a postcard to miss	mccrady head of the harvard appointment office asking her please	to write northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances.	8.479787352534103
3134. actually tom had been postponing giving them an answer i'm	confident because he did not want to go out there to teach.	13.259795527902385
3135. in fact	he didn't want to teach anywhere.	15.793815426101952
3136. he wanted to go back to harvard	for another year of playwriting.	20.11340472309138
3137. but papa's death had further complicated	the financing of tom's hoped-for third year and for the	weeks following it tom did not know whether his return to harvard could	be arranged.	8.940917695967487
3138. but things were worked out in the family and	late in august he wrote miss mccrady an explanatory letter in which	he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition	after papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home	with mama accept the northwestern job or return to harvard.	10.215046676251099
3139. but	he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition	that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor	baker.	8.276785738553196
3140. and that's what he did.	12.7224155594214
3141. that third year he wrote plays	with a fury.	15.369069622934138
3142. i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now	housed in the houghton library at harvard; i think i'm right	in that figure.	11.241353790845066
3143. that fall he submitted to professor baker the first	acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays six of them	according to some of his associates and he also worked on a play	that he first called niggertown the material for which he had collected	during the summer at home.	8.094302972069936
3144. later this play would be called welcome	to our city.	14.272537355067428
3145. in the spring it must have been he began	working on the play that he called the house which later would	be mannerhouse.	13.247347239862384
3146. that spring welcome to our city was selected	for production by the 47 workshop and it was staged in the middle	of may.	11.2032346766302
3147. it ran two nights and though it was generally praised there	was considerable criticism of its length.	11.676174551097459
3148. it ran until past one o'clock.	23.729432886271383
3149. that was tom's weakness; it was demonstrated many critics	would later point out in the length of his novels.	12.610741326244705
3150. in this play	there were so many characters and so much detail.	16.507424878165114
3151. tom never knew how	to condense to boil down.	10.772164915044634
3152. he was always concerned with life and he	tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed tight.	12.581370433928027
3153. he	was a big man and he wanted nothing little squeezed; he despised parsimony	and particularly of words.	9.904499152261817
3154. in this play there were some thirty	or more named characters and i don't know how many more unnamed.	12.227499679272697
3155. in describing it to professor baker after it had been chosen for	production he defended his great array of characters by declaring that	he had included that many not because i didn't know how to save	paint but because the play required them.	8.464627959244673
3156. and he threatened someday	to write a play with fifty eighty a hundred people- a whole	town a whole race a whole epoch.	11.32767951766734
3157. he said he would do it though	probably nobody would produce it for his own soul's ease and	comfort.	17.253023748916192
3158. that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard	but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall.	12.022629400877848
3159. instead	he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city	to the theatre guild which had asked him to let them have a look at	it after professor baker had recommended it highly.	9.387771100467019
3160. he hung around	new york waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production	and in that time came down to asheville and also paid a short visit	to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visited old	friends and favorite campus spots.	9.117399152206877
3161. on returning to new york he had	a job for several weeks; it was visiting university of north carolina	alumni in new york to ask them for contributions to the graham	memorial building fund.	9.691280356200647
3162. the graham memorial would be the campus	student union honoring the late and much beloved edward kidder graham	who had been president when tom entered the university.	10.12610343261758
3163. well	the theatre guild kept that play and kept it and finally in	december they turned it down.	8.29272515769823
3164. but they would reconsider it they assured	him if he would rewrite it.	17.46135063032734
3165. tom told me about it how one evening	he went over to see the theatre guild man.	9.178012510582208
3166. this man tom said	had the play shut up in his desk i believe and when tom sat down	he pulled it out and apologetically told tom that they wouldn't be	able to use it.	9.323334244498332
3167. tom said he almost burst into tears he was so	disappointed and put out.	9.739219549559824
3168. the man tom said explained that it was	not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort	of thing the public wanted.	11.056474313077528
3169. the public tom said the man told him	wanted realism and his play wasn't that.	10.797428445201191
3170. it was fantastic writing	beautiful writing the man declared but the public he insisted	wanted realism.	15.691600636925086
3171. tom was not willing to revise the play according	to the plan the man suggested.	9.250214943488718
3172. such a revision he said would ruin	it would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment.	15.269453122786828
3173. he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do	it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made.	11.276845997970874
3174. it was not until we had returned to the city to live while i	was still at brown and sharpe's that i felt the full impact of	evangelical christianity.	17.051473769500078
3175. i came under the spell of a younger group	in the church led by the pastor's older son.	10.679851126090064
3176. the spirit of this group	was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed to eternal	punishment but that god through jesus christ has provided a way of	escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation.	11.89474743773688
3177. there are millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed are those	who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on	their souls night and day.	9.336813650854188
3178. this group in park place church was made	up of the earnest few.	14.214868555585658
3179. i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns	and responsibilities.	14.289923224785284
3180. i engaged more and more in religious activities.	19.28561548986645
3181. besides church and sunday school i went to out-of-door meetings	on the sidewalk at the church door.	10.840261379402166
3182. i went to an afternoon service	at the ymca.	18.26113263739884
3183. i went to the christian endeavor society	and to the evening service of the church.	15.40406207955458
3184. much of this lacked the active	support of the pastor.	20.696116816354742
3185. the young people were self-energizing and	i was energized.	14.437859561797689
3186. once or twice my father asked me if i wasn't overdoing	a bit in my churchgoing.	14.31019553761028
3187. meanwhile i myself was not yet	saved.	13.687398220999578
3188. at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of	conversion.	22.080699238557077
3189. try as i might to confess my sins and accept salvation	no answer came to me from heaven.	9.002733151819228
3190. finally after years i gave up.	16.179734806141106
3191. the basic difficulty i suppose was in my ultimate inability	to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief.	9.014357448449532
3192. i was familiar	with pilgrim's progress which i read as literature.	16.755888446513726
3193. no load	of sin had been laid on my shoulders nor did earnest effort enable	me to become conscious of one.	9.070989453367899
3194. there is of course the doctrine	of original sin which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes	of the guilt of our first ancestor.	15.60067159213811
3195. in the rhyming catechism this	doctrine is worded thus: in adam's fall we sin-ned all.	12.226852369311269
3196. this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense.	15.63799501176316
3197. i did not feel	it presumptuous to expect that the creator would be at least as just	as the most righteous of his creatures; and the doctrine of original	sin is compounded of injustice.	9.921626387417305
3198. some of these thoughts- not	all of them- have taken organized form in later years.	15.431720973332949
3199. the actual	impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another	sort.	10.61385277229228
3200. i became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of	my own miserable soul.	14.020440920934044
3201. i found myself becoming one of that group of	people who in carlyle's words are forever gazing into their own	navels anxiously asking 'am i right am i wrong'?	8.900145677143827
3202.  i bethought	me of the lord's prayer and these words came to mind:	thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.	12.410146829930165
3203. they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years	which since have passed.	12.05169051224121
3204. from that time to this my religious concern	is that i might give effective help to the bringing in of god's kingdom	on earth.	12.27225887745154
3205. i do not claim to be free from sin or from the	need for repentance and forgiveness.	14.95109041989331
3206. in my experience the assurance	of forgiveness comes only when i have confessed to the wronged one and	have made as full reparation as i can devise.	11.103494734832141
3207. there was one	further step in my religious progress.	21.795649825065023
3208. this was taken after i came	to live in springfield and it was made under the guidance of the reverend	raymond beardslee a young preacher who came to the congregational	church there at about the same time that i moved from new york.	13.475775543196916
3209. his father was a professor at hartford theological seminary	and from him he acquired a conviction which he passed along to me that	there is in the universe of persons a moral law the law of love	which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law.	9.071208933647709
3210. it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable	in all personal relationships whether individually socially	or as between whole nations of people.	12.74737919014889
3211. if obeyed the law brings order	and satisfaction.	16.122160126925362
3212. if disobeyed the result is turmoil and chaos.	22.041575253524577
3213. as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable.	12.477218151579738
3214. we can conceive of no alternatives.	24.477229024319502
3215. their basis seems deeper	than mere authority.	13.233458217711917
3216. they are not true because scientists or prophets	say they are true.	17.02235149217569
3217. it is not the authority of god himself which	makes them true.	25.520115018584843
3218. because god is what he is the laws of the universe	material and spiritual are what they are.	16.0660922589225
3219. deity and law are one	and inseparable.	11.867291106449708
3220. with this conviction the partition between	the sacred and the secular disappears.	14.937285534434128
3221. one's daily work becomes sacred	since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law	dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy.	9.556496145124761
3222. in his book civilization and ethics albert schweitzer faces	the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business	life for example.	11.35219524987438
3223. his ethics defines possessions as the	property of the community of which the individual is sovereign steward.	11.843132464036742
3224. one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain	number of employees draw their means of subsistence; another by giving	away his property in order to help his fellow man.	10.334321611299853
3225. each will decide	on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according	to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular	circumstances of his own life.	10.159607026694554
3226. no one is to judge others.	21.45485911580018
3227. he is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds	it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for	the sake of a larger good.	11.702255613754234
3228. for this decision a man must take personal	responsibility.	25.934567024847325
3229. says he i may never imagine that in the struggle	between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible	to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape	of a relative ethic; or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive.	7.784842088250489
3230. on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between	the two.	14.831233989139731
3231. schweitzer seems in fact to acquire for himself	a burden of sin not bequeathed by adam but accumulated in the	inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and	lesser responsibilities.	7.577975536232771
3232. this viewpoint i find interesting but it	has never weighed on my soul.	12.817239845831333
3233. my own experience	has followed simpler lines.	14.195054884578044
3234. an uncompromising belief in the	moral law has the advantage of making religion natural even as physical	law is natural.	11.723343799622928
3235. neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels	any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy	nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience.	9.32365384712625
3236. to	obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense applied to a neglected	field.	10.358652090748608
3237. religion thus becomes integrated with life.	11.867291106449708
3238. this	truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries.	11.330154800079951
3239. one	of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life.	17.06565313392752
3240. in seeking	for such meaning and purpose albert schweitzer seized upon the concept	of the sacredness of life.	12.30667194255898
3241. it is puzzling to the occidental	mind to assign sacredness to animal insect	and plant life.	14.006699129233729
3242. these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order	and are unburdened with moral responsibility.	12.469900628999811
3243. there is indeed a	moral responsibility on man himself for his own soul's sake to respect	lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering but this viewpoint	schweitzer rejects.	11.068341890854024
3244. so far as sacredness inheres	in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality	whether in lambarene africa or in washington dc.	18.97791844173108
3245. one	cannot read the records of scientists officials and travelers who	have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing	that each individual met with is a person.	9.155415174137275
3246. read for instance	in	malcolm macdonald's borneo people of segura and her wise	father tomonggong koh and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization.	10.059945423152644
3247. above all read in jens bjerre's the last cannibals	how the old man of the wailbri tribe in central australia	gave to the white man his choicest possession while the tears	streamed down his face.	8.995262226755544
3248. the australian aborigine is the conventional	exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth of sensibility	which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our	civilization.	11.7462353009374
3249. persons whether white black brown or yellow	are a concern of god.	9.536539998875496
3250. respect for personality is a privilege and a	duty for us as brothers.	10.635267499930531
3251. such is the field for exercising our	reverence.	16.040513590643297
3252. as to our action let us align ourselves with the purpose	expressed by jesus in the lord's prayer: thy kingdom come	thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.	12.136115749645768
3253. with the knowledge	that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations	with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means	and the ends of our lives.	9.207625365681812
3254. this intellectual approach to spiritual	life suited me well because i was never content to lead a divided	life.	11.349709341667586
3255. as i have said words from tennyson remain ever in my memory:	that mind and soul according well may make one music as	before.	11.034771271405587
3256. let us now give some thought to the soul.	18.66610714441994
3257. when the	young biologist dr ballard began to show interest in our daughter	elizabeth this induced a corresponding interest on our part in	him.	10.791405307164071
3258. i asked one day what he was doing.	22.736424624315983
3259. he told me that he had a big	newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the	big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto	the big newt.	11.216031698619032
3260. he was then noting that the big eye on the little newt	hung back until the little eye had grown up to it while the little	eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other.	10.913035433612153
3261. then	i asked what does that teach you?	11.118618003375188
3262.  said he it teaches	me to wonder.	19.690626594549265
3263. this was a profound statement.	27.290859906480517
3264. in the face	of the unfolding universe our ultimate attitude is that of wonder.	17.527956030728074
3265. wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world.	10.04760905749492
3266. gone are the days when in the nineteenth century scientists thought	that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of	the physical universe.	12.541707633092093
3267. for them only a little more needed to be learned	and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted packaged	and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human	problem.	8.84054290068626
3268. this complacency was blown to bits by the relativity	of einstein the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the	discovery of the expanding universe.	10.851535758506452
3269. none of these discoveries were	neatly rounded off bits of knowledge.	14.83807406354196
3270. each faded out into the unexplored	areas of the future.	15.478559401626605
3271. it is as if we in our center of human	observation from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown.	14.209060643026062
3272. as our radius of penetration r increases the area of new	knowledge	increases by f and the total of human knowledge becomes measured	in terms of f.	11.107085582649312
3273. there are	some people intelligent people who seem to be untouched by the sea	of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives.	12.632146212448058
3274. one	such is abraham meyer the writer of a recent book speaking of	man.	10.635267499930531
3275. this is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and	a vigorous defense of pure materialism.	14.491260285637608
3276. his inability to wonder vitiates	his argument.	15.982618402857776
3277. the subject of immortality brings to mind a	vivid incident which took place in 1929 at montreux in switzerland.	11.41539809658874
3278. criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for	our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past	have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature.	8.802983096919936
3279. i have chosen five	contrasting pairs ten men in all and they are arranged in roughly	chronological order.	13.21562373214274
3280. such a list must naturally be selective and the	treatment of each man is brief for i am interested only in their general	ideas on the moral measure of literature.	9.952852594952178
3281. altogether the list	will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones	for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider	art above ethics all the way from plato to poe.	10.198377592203865
3282. and most of the	great periods are represented because we will compare plato and aristotle	from the golden age of greece; stephen gosson and sir philip	sidney from renaissance england; dr johnson and william	hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england;	and james russell lowell and edgar allan poe of nineteenth	century american letters.	9.284006914075846
3283. plato and aristotle	agree on some vital literary issues.	10.530932308755343
3284. they both measure literature	by moral standards and in their political writings both allow for	censorship but the differences between them are also significant.	10.972352180711574
3285. while	aristotle censors literature only for the young plato would banish	all poets from his ideal state.	9.701978006754235
3286. even more important in his poetics	aristotle differs somewhat from plato when he moves in the	direction of treating literature as a unique thing separate and apart	from its causes and its effects.	9.54889039472692
3287. all through the republic	plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately	to a good life for his citizens.	9.82876480811514
3288. in short he is constantly concerned	with the ethical effects.	17.45036638236957
3289. when he discusses the subject matter	of poetry he asks what moral effect the scenes will have.	11.285217239752688
3290. when he	turns briefly to literary style in the third book he again looks to	the effect on the audience.	12.910871424777044
3291. he explains that his citizens must not	be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that	one finds in much poetry and he observes that all these pantomimic	gentlemen will be sent to another state.	8.319927938479195
3292. only those story tellers	will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous.	15.316969417103932
3293. plato is at times just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he	is of their work.	8.29272515769823
3294. when he discusses tyrants in the eighth book of	the republic he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst	rulers.	12.438927802281698
3295. but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears	in the tenth book and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms.	12.3480043595302
3296. in plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the	poet and the philosopher because the poet imitates only particular objects	and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction much	less the highest level of ideal forms.	10.904429288176576
3297. true reality of course is	the ideal and the poet knows nothing of this; only the philosopher	knows the truth.	8.896750385073009
3298. poets moreover dwell on human passions.	13.915190642667962
3299. and	with this point about the passions we encounter plato's dualism.	10.419242411823294
3300. the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both babbitt and	more that we must examine it in some detail.	11.872017513463552
3301. plato feels that man	has two competing aspects his rational faculty and his irrational.	8.834168570742513
3302. we can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures the passions	in this case and strengthen our rational side; and poetry with all	its emphasis on the passions encourages the audience to give way to	emotion.	9.95200063415919
3303. for this reason then poetry tends to weaken the power of	control the reason because it tempts one to indulge his passions and	even the best of men he maintains may be corrupted by this subtle	influence.	9.109097718189835
3304. plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something	of an enigma because he is so completely sensitive to its charm.	11.440349199062675
3305. his whole objection indeed seems to rise out of a deep conviction	that the poets do have great power to influence but plato seldom	pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself.	7.968735621124694
3306. he is	rather concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets	to join his fight for justice.	11.998880136005956
3307. he wants them to use their great power	to strengthen man's rational side to teach virtue and to encourage	religion.	10.932254493944441
3308. while plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns	to the gods and famous men still he clearly leaves the way open for	further discussion of the issue.	9.90898796298475
3309. he even calls upon the poets to defend	the muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue.	10.766817556135246
3310. he says:	we	may further grant to those of her poetry's defenders	who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to	speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant	but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen	in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the	gainers- i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight.	9.898767283934676
3311. when we turn to aristotle's ideas on the moral measure	of literature it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned	about the influence of the art.	13.922328866295535
3312. in the ideal state for instance	he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully	selected tales and stories.	11.89554387735105
3313. for this reason he would banish indecent	pictures and speeches from the stage; and the young people should	not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to	drink strong wine and sit at the public tables.	8.931155629401205
3314. by the time they reach	that age however aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence	of comedies.	14.333300982812961
3315. in aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the	poetics we find an attempt to isolate the art to consider only	those things proper to it to discover how it differs from other arts	and to deal with the effects peculiar to it.	8.741743274941093
3316. he assures us early	in the poetics that all art is imitation and that all imitation	gives pleasure but he distinguishes between art in general and	poetic art on the basis of the means manner and the objects of the	imitation.	10.11532852150244
3317. once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms	he lays down his famous definition of tragedy which sets up standards	and so lends direction to the remainder of the work.	10.325495661904213
3318. a tragedy by	his definition is an imitation of an action that is serious of a certain	magnitude and complete in itself.	10.70371139476269
3319. it should have a dramatic form	with pleasing language and it should portray incidents which so arouse	pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience.	10.8244886798934
3320. any	tragedy he maintains has six elements: plot character and thought	diction and melody	and spectacle.	10.358652090748608
3321. throughout the rest of	the poetics aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics	of these six	parts and their interrelationship and he refers frequently to the	standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.	8.194250882197736
3322. aristotle's	method in the poetics then does suggest that we should isolate	the work.	11.632297328443187
3323. the chicago contingent of modern critics follow aristotle	so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare	one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation.	12.490106404524958
3324. but there are	however several features of aristotle's approach which open the	way for the moral measure of literature.	14.339670278437945
3325. for one thing aristotle mentions	that plays may corrupt the audience.	17.647409788245668
3326. in addition his definition	of a tragedy invites our attention because a serious and important	action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author	or of the characters.	10.554135772333233
3327. and there is one other point in the poetics that	invites moral evaluation: aristotle's notion that the distinctive	function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity	and fear.	12.391495865873676
3328. he rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to	that end.	15.586249198110746
3329. the point is that an ethical critic with an assist from freud	can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with	a harmless outlet for our hostile urges.	8.754072057952898
3330. in his study samuel johnson	joseph wood krutch takes this line when he says that what aristotle	really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions	may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is less likely	that we shall indulge them through our own acts.	10.572517485853858
3331. in krutch's view	this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without	employing the explicit methods of a moralist.	9.645359721770136
3332. and we can add that	krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to plato's	fear that poetry will encourage our passions.	10.851024531509594
3333. if krutch is correct	tragedy may have quite the opposite effect.	12.94788651077971
3334. it may allay our passions	and so restore the rule of reason.	21.631655094936967
3335. or in more freudian terms	the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen	the ego and superego.	9.140263172310235
3336. the second half of	the sixteenth century in england was the setting for a violent and long	controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially	the drama.	12.520506140105363
3337. no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art	were irrelevant.	15.108506178688629
3338. both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral	test but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or	a bad influence.	9.792491115404575
3339. both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported	their cause.	13.67851763362287
3340. those who wanted to close the theaters for example	pointed to plato's republic and those who wished to keep them	open called on the plato of the ion to testify in their behalf.	10.300655420937103
3341. the most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps	sir philip sidney's an apologie for poetrie published	in 1595.	10.175731001067163
3342. many students of literature know that classical defense.	15.003179019087538
3343. what is not so well known however and what is quite important for	understanding the issues of this early quarrel is the kind of attack	on literature that sidney was answering.	11.587548952090032
3344. for this reason then i want	to describe first two examples of the puritanical attacks: stephen	gosson's the school of abuse 1579 and his later playes	confuted published in 1582.	11.131352124429952
3345. second we will see how sidney	answered the charges for while sidney's essay was not specifically	a reply to gosson his arguments do support the new theater.	7.971474452968774
3346. according to william ringler's study stephen gosson the theater	business in london had become a thriving enterprise by 1577 and	in the opinion of many a thoroughly bad business.	11.563698809913557
3347. aroused by what	they considered an evil influence some members of the clergy joined	by city authorities merchants and master craftsmen began the attack	on the plays and the actors for what they called the abuses of the	art but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of	acting.	7.879300542691438
3348. although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from	some men who were not technically puritans still once the puritans	gained power they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance	of 1642 which decreed that all public stage-plays shall cease	and be forborne.	9.150235852293463
3349. with that act of parliament the opponents of the	stage won the day and for more than two decades after that england	had no legitimate public drama.	10.124181471942185
3350. in the early days of this controversy	over the theater one of the interested parties stephen gosson	published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses	of art rather than the art itself.	13.947709306098645
3351. but his opposition hardened and	by 1579 in the school of abuse he was ready to banish all players.	12.480146633555794
3352. he advises women to beware of those places which in sorrows	cheere you and beguile you in mirth.	11.272564027374363
3353. he does not really approve	of levity and laughter but sex is the deadly sin.	13.879153912032917
3354. he warns that	a single glance can lead us into temptation for looking eies have	lyking hartes and lyking hartes may burne in lust.	10.226931923435139
3355. but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions	at the point just reached.	18.106890777391804
3356. fortunately it is possible to be somewhat	more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in	education.	16.7929183591628
3357. for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and	psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities	and particularly from the cornell values studies.	9.004970144161177
3358. in the latter	research program	information is available for 2758 cornell students	surveyed in 1950 and for 1571 students surveyed in 1952.	12.188727874127855
3359. of the	latter sample 944 persons had been studied two years earlier; hence	changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals	at two points in time.	8.304736790953791
3360. in addition the 1952 study collected	comparable data from 4585 students at ten other colleges and universities	scattered across the country: dartmouth harvard yale wesleyan	north carolina fisk texas university of california at	los angeles wayne and michigan.	10.660406723882456
3361. we find in the first	place that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education	positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing do not	accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the	public prints and on the whole approve of the way their university	deals with value-problems and value inculcation.	9.140101556249848
3362. it is not our impression	that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful	ignorance; rather the generality of these students find their	university experience congenial to their own sense of values.	13.830588783961657
3363. students	are approximately equally divided between those who regard	vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those	who chose a general liberal education.	8.216910365488
3364. other conceivable goals	such as character-education and social adjustment are of secondary	importance to them.	11.131427923863393
3365. the ideal of a liberal education impresses itself	upon the students more and more as they move through college.	10.700382736436936
3366. even	in such technical curricula as engineering the senior is much more	likely than the freshman to choose as an ideal liberal education over	specific vocational preparation.	8.777324869432913
3367. in the university milieu of scholarship	and research of social diversity of new ideas and varied and	wide-ranging interests socialization into a campus culture apparently	means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education	in the arts and sciences.	9.926116572609455
3368. students' choices of ideal	educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical.	11.33819267263277
3369. there is a clear	relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic	pattern of general values.	16.517170887491677
3370. the selective and directional qualities of	basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data: the	success-oriented	students choose vocational preparation the other-directed	choose goals of social adjustment	the intellectuals choose a liberal arts emphasis.	9.11199125168746
3371. the same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices.	14.009697241889988
3372. there is impressive consistency between specific occupational	preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a	good way of life.	14.650112042819657
3373. and contrary to many popular assertions the goal-values	chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic	success nor to mere conformity.	10.043303061405329
3374. our students want occupations	that permit them to use their talents and training to be creative	and original to work with and to help other people.	10.523852585069104
3375. they also want	money prestige and security.	18.21012427828325
3376. but they are optimistic about their	prospects in these regards; they set limits to their aspirations-	few aspire to millions of dollars or to imperial power and	glory.	12.977938458580455
3377. within the fixed frame of these aspirations they can afford	to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of	occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power	prestige and wealth.	8.618202948071742
3378. occupational choices are also useful-	and interesting- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute	the only component in goals and aspirations.	9.051154372622117
3379. for there is also the	face of reality in the form of the individual's perceptions	of	his own abilities and interests of the objective possibilities open	to him of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed.	10.616278132861764
3380. we find reluctant recruits whose values are not in line with	their expected occupation's characteristics.	13.51247461108391
3381. students develop occupational	images- not always accurate or detailed- and they try to	fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation.	8.101513743852289
3382. the purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute.	14.310793878502059
3383. furthermore many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands	or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity	or of ability and performance.	10.430884533150833
3384. thus many a creativity-oriented aspirant	for a career in architecture drama or journalism resigns himself	to a real estate business; many a people-oriented student who dreams	of the md decides to enter his father's advertising agency;	and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were	better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice	it.	8.667329436724199
3385. the old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant- but	so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy.	10.432320814914952
3386. in their views on dating courtship sex and family	life our students prefer what they are expected to prefer.	14.21510310530959
3387. for them	in the grim words of a once-popular song love and marriage go together	like a horse and carriage.	9.89073019082323
3388. their expressed standards concerning	sex roles desirable age for marriage characteristics of an ideal mate	number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes	of the preceding generation- minus compulsive rebellion.	8.66283501238716
3389. they	even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense	ie both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards	for women and women apply to both sexes a standard different from	that held by men.	7.274587416197399
3390. conservatism and traditionalism	seem implied by what has just been said.	11.33819267263277
3391. but these terms are treacherous.	23.65061755049962
3392. in the field of political values it is certainly true that	students are not radical not rebels against their parents or their peers.	14.190385967692233
3393. and as they go through college the students tend to bring their	political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups	to which they belong.	9.515761997081265
3394. yet they have accepted most of the extant welfare	state provisions for health security and the regulation of	economic affairs and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional	liberalism of the bill of rights.	10.606956541314933
3395. when their faith in civil	liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific	issues eg suppression of dangerous ideas many waver	and give in.	8.482650910768692
3396. the students who are most willing to acquiesce in the	suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to	be prejudiced against minority groups to be conformist and traditionalistic	in general social attitudes and to lack a basic faith in people.	9.027454141736426
3397. as one looks at the existing evidence one finds a correlation	although only a slight one between high grades and libertarian	values.	9.742383208691285
3398. but the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen.	19.874437701433678
3399. in other words as students go through college those who are	most successful academically tend to become more committed to a bill	of rights orientation.	10.344358372405571
3400. college in gross- just the general experience-	may have varying effects but the the students who are successful	emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values.	9.347576056083255
3401. this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are	more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties	than the other students.	9.513881971187033
3402. there is now substantial evidence	from several major studies of college students that the experience of	the college years results in a certain selective homogenization of	attitudes and values.	13.234516190781767
3403. detached from their prior statuses and social	groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu	the students tend to assimilate a new common culture to converge	toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus.	8.383242381125177
3404. furthermore	in certain respects there are norms common to colleges and universities	across the country.	10.829833106340251
3405. for instance college-educated people consistently	show up in study after study as more often than others supporters	of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and liberties.	8.999413712922804
3406. the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which	students tend to converge include toleration of diversity.	13.282194849507942
3407. to the extent that our sampling of the orientations of american college	students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our	culture- and still valid in 1959- we are disposed to question the	summary characterization of the current generation as silent beat	apathetic or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided	solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes.	7.893140835856442
3408. our data	indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing	institutions of the society and in the face of the realities of complex	and large-scale economic and political problems make a wary and	ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized	responsibility for coping with such collective concerns.	10.706833402764959
3409. in	a real sense they are admittedly conservative but their conservatism	incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original radicalism	of 1776.	9.719592036667228
3410. although we have no measures of its strength or intensity	the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained.	13.726458058163576
3411. as they move through the college years our young men and women are socialized	into a broadly similar culture at the level of personal	behavior.	10.658665151992839
3412. in this sense also they are surely conformists.	24.696696320088087
3413. it is	even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity- everyone	does it- as a criterion for conduct.	9.757475451646688
3414. but the extent of	ethical robotism is easily overestimated.	19.874437701433678
3415. few students are really so	faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our	institutions of higher learning.	8.522476217538351
3416. and it may be well to recall that to	say	conformity is in part another way of saying orderly human	society.	14.98047990238408
3417. in the field of religious beliefs and values the	college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture.	13.535971960784542
3418. their commitments are for the most part couched in a familiar idiom.	15.42565700579438
3419. students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate	personal philosophy.	10.76046447084964
3420. avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as	to be a curiosity.	10.957705180640192
3421. the religious quest is often intense and deep	and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with	the most profound questions of meaning and value.	8.115239882301966
3422. at the same time	a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means	of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional	security.	12.926120423069094
3423. these personal and social goals often overshadow the	goals of intellectual clarity and spiritual transcendence.	9.495459372186279
3424. the cult	of adjustment does exist.	19.926638570224114
3425. it exists alongside the acceptance of	traditional forms of organized religion	.	14.157168776918788
3426. still another segment of the student population consists	of those who seek in what they regard as religion intellectual clarity	rational belief and ethical guidance and reinforcement.	10.248349127920367
3427. our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly	orthodox and religiously involved.	9.790072039264118
3428. upon second thought we were	forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks	against which we might compare the present situation and that conclusions	that present-day students are more or less religious	could not be defended on the basis of our data.	11.501502218494755
3429. as we looked more intently	at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation	we received the impression that many of the religious convictions	expressed represented a conventional acceptance of low intensity.	11.850234358468954
3430. but here again comparative benchmarks are lacking and we do not	know in any case what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect	from healthy young secure and relatively inexperienced persons;	after all feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions	of youth.	9.149696129884314
3431. nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at	all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country.	9.99283090031335
3432. kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values	during a period of years primarily 1935-1955 but extending much farther	back in some instances.	10.036199955114311
3433. a variety of data are assembled to bear	upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality work-success	ethic individualism achievement lessened emphasis on future-time	orientation in favor of sociability moral relativism consideration and	tolerance conformity hedonistic present-time orientation.	8.395082757858734
3434. although	he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion	and the alleged increase in conformity and thinks that hedonistic	present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed	to it he does conclude that americans increasingly enjoy leisure	without guilt do not stress achievement so much as formerly are more	accepting of group harmony as a goal more tolerant of diversity and	aware of other cultures.	9.042340129050046
3435. from new jersey morgan hastened to the headquarters of washington	at whitemarsh pennsylvania arriving there on november 18th.	9.96692165399657
3436. there was much sickness in the corps and the men were in addition	without the clothing shoes and blankets needed for the winter weather.	14.627265437823992
3437. morgan himself had sciatica again.	12.851133807717682
3438. even on his tough constitution	the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest.	12.120396182962816
3439. on the morning of november 17th cornwallis and 2000	men had left philadelphia with the object of capturing fort mercer	at red bank new jersey.	10.949439462745167
3440. in order to prevent this washington hastened	to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort including a force	under the marquis de lafayette containing some 160 of morgan's	riflemen all who were fit for duty at this time the rest having no shoes.	10.642070607560177
3441. although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of cornwallis	morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing	at the redcoats.	14.10847836742714
3442. a picket guard of about 350 mostly hessians were	attacked by the americans under lafayette and driven back to their	camp some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire.	8.910884728010025
3443. i never saw men lafayette declared in regard to the	riflemen so merry so spirited and so desirous to go on to the	enemy whatever force they might have as that small party in this fight.	9.159533803015592
3444. nathanael greene told washington that lafayette was charmed	with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen.	9.723773562266802
3445. a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an	attack upon the american camp.	12.06826425129716
3446. the british general moved his forces	north from philadelphia to chestnut hill near the right wing of	the patriot encampment.	11.19335429483069
3447. here the pennsylvania militia skirmished with	the british but soon fled.	13.795419029756141
3448. morgan was ordered to attack the enemy	who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans.	11.509100238709854
3449. similar orders were given to the maryland militia.	13.474700673297047
3450. morgan immediately	disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait.	10.993045834974794
3451. a body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope a tempting	target for the riflemen who threw a volley into their ranks and messed	up the smart formation considerably.	8.34914251419788
3452. now the riflemen and the	marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the british	giving them another telling round of fire.	11.618280108419027
3453. the redcoats ran like	rabbits.	19.440309286487764
3454. but the maryland militia had likewise fled all too typical	of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which gave	morgan little confidence in militia in general as he watched other	instances of their breaking in hot engagements.	9.936669065875503
3455. the british although	suffering considerable losses noted the defection of the marylanders	made a stand then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly	outnumbered and had to retire.	9.167061791953707
3456. the americans lost forty-four	men among them major joseph morris of morgan's regiment an	officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection not only by his	commander but by washington and lafayette as well.	8.891886196032393
3457. the latter was	so upset on learning of the death of morris that he wrote morgan	a letter showing his own warmhearted generosity.	10.50935105755621
3458. after complimenting	morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to congress	too the ardent frenchman added he felt that congress should make	some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris but that	he	knew morgan realized how long such action usually required if it was	done at all.	8.452289628834428
3459. as mrs morris may be in some want before that	time lafayette continued i am going to trouble you with a commission	which i beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy.	9.130265594359418
3460. if	she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of	congress it would not become a stranger unknown to her to offer himself	for that purpose.	9.535158452257333
3461. but you could tell her that	you had friends who being with the army don't know what to do with	their money and h would willingly let her have one or many thousand	dollars.	10.362094844410189
3462. this was accordingly done and the plight of the grateful	mrs morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan	the amount of which is not known.	16.692298753312098
3463. apparently still sensitive	about the idea with which general gates had approached him at saratoga	namely that george washington be replaced morgan was vehement	in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around	philadelphia.	8.266776103303174
3464. richard peters secretary of the board of war thought	morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying	to pick a quarrel.	14.294796702477752
3465. morgan hotly denied this and informed the board	of war that the men in camp linked the name of peters with the plot	against washington.	8.850626751129017
3466. peters insisted that this impression was a great	misunderstanding and evidently from the quarrel obtained an unfavorable	impression of morgan's judgment.	9.279660741389986
3467. such a situation regarding	the board of war could hardly have helped morgan's chances for	promotion when that matter came before the group later on.	9.659959429846364
3468. in	late december the american army moved from whitemarsh to valley	forge and although the distance was only 13 miles the journey took	more than a week because of the bad weather the barefooted and almost	naked men.	9.208418598759918
3469. the position of the new camp was admirably selected and	well fortified its easily defensible nature being one good reason why	howe did not attack it.	10.487914828041905
3470. besides helping to prevent the movement of	the british to the west valley forge also obstructed the trade between	howe's forces and the farmers thus threatening the vital subsistence	of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary	supplies extremely hazardous.	9.121831967956684
3471. in order to see that this hindering	situation remained effective washington detached several bodies of his	troops to the periphery of the philadelphia area.	11.002102382032861
3472. morgan and	his corps were placed on the west side of the schuylkill river with	instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and	to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy.	12.280681134776938
3473. the headquarters	of morgan was on a farm said to have been particularly well located	so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british a	practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for	british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency.	8.948032038860239
3474. in his dealings with offenders however morgan was typically	firm but just.	15.614845457490386
3475. for example he captured some persons from york county	who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man	who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife	and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household	goods.	8.772598352959278
3476. morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its	thankful owners but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free.	9.593735817596315
3477. morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him	for scouting duty most of them he said being useless.	0.0
3478. they straggle	at such a rate he told the commander-in-chief that if the	enemy were enterprising they might get two from us when we would take	one of them which makes me wish general howe would go on lest any	incident happen to us.	9.14423535695009
3479. if the hardships of the winter at	valley forge were trying for healthy men they were of course much	more so for those not in good health.	10.248634920568069
3480. daniel morgan's rheumatic condition	worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather.	13.621468878544981
3481. he	had braved the elements and the enemy but the strain aided by the winter	was catching up with him at last.	8.732307791081995
3482. also he was now forty-three	years old.	17.123073413959418
3483. the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the	troops at valley forge could be handled by a subordinate he felt	so like henry knox equally loyal to washington who went to boston	at this time morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia	for several weeks.	7.475229677253655
3484. in his absence the rifle regiment was under	the command of major thomas posey another able virginian.	12.682310915053117
3485. but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william	pickman in salem massachusetts apparently an acquaintance praising	washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were	opposed by the general current of the people h to exalt general	gates at the expense of general washington was injurious to the latter.	8.499276112359636
3486. if there be a disinterested patriot in america 'tis general	washington and his bravery none can question.	14.633722153755242
3487. it is doubtful	if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children	for his pay as shown by the war department abstracts of early	1778 was $75 a month as a colonel and that apt to be delayed.	10.855880644040278
3488. he	was shown a warm welcome regardless and spent the time in winchester	recuperating from his ailment enjoying his family and arranging his	private affairs which were of course run down.	10.344722668710485
3489. his neighbors celebrated	his return even if it was only temporary and morgan was especially	gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend isaac	lane who told him a man that has so often left all that is dear	to him as thou hast to serve thy country must create a sympathetic	feeling in every patriotic heart.	8.096149253803272
3490. there must have been special	feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of daniel morgan too	when the news was received on april 30th of the recognition by france	of the independence of the united states.	13.781832430607192
3491. his fellow virginian	george washington had stated i believe no event was ever received	with more heartfelt joy.	9.525321795548937
3492. the dreary camp at valley forge	was turned into an arena of rejoicing.	12.445450562798397
3493. even the dignified washington	indulged in a game of wickets with some children.	13.259608917242259
3494. his soldiers on the	whole did not celebrate so mildly.	13.11972343880311
3495. on may 6th morgan who had returned	received from washington orders to send out patrols under	vigilant officers to keep near the enemy.	9.921476478495501
3496. the reason for this	the orders said is that the enemy may think to take advantage of	the celebration of this day.	16.96673459811114
3497. the troops must have more than the common	quantity of liquor and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness	among them.	12.047674451517109
3498. apparently no serious disorders resulted from	the celebration and within a few days morgan joined the force of	lafayette who now had command of some 2000 men at barren hill not	far above philadelphia on the schuylkill.	9.404654579274013
3499. the frenchman had been	ordered to approach the enemy's lines harass them and get intelligence	of their movements.	9.812346753173191
3500. interestingly enough the order transmitted	to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that a party	of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at whitemarsh	and act with them.	9.42172670079876
3501. washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be cautious as well	as aggressive for on may 17th 18th and 20th he admonished the leader	of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert.	7.664662419106059
3502. obviously the commander-in-chief	had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence	too for on the 23rd of may he told morgan that the british were	prepared to move perhaps in the night and asked morgan to have two	of his best horses ready to dispatch to general smallwood with the	intelligence obtained.	8.76813552844717
3503. meantime however this same general smallwood	seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the american army.	11.039154345472179
3504. colonel	benjamin ford wrote to morgan from wilmington that he understood	a mrs sanderson from maryland had obtained permission from smallwood	to visit philadelphia and would return on may 26th escorted	by several officers from maryland belonging to the new levies	in the british service.	8.366295536396052
3505. ford urged morgan to capture these men	who he thought might be disguised as quakers or peasants.	8.29272515769823
3506. morgan took	the suggested steps but when mrs sanderson appeared there was	nobody with her but her husband whom he promptly sent to headquarters	to be questioned.	8.777324869432913
3507. but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence	much more important to his commanding general.	12.525045592544796
3508. a letter of a	few days later from washington's aide to morgan stated his excellency	is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion.	10.020400941055252
3509. for by now the original cause of the quarrel philip's seizure of	gascony was only one strand in the spider web of french interests that	overlay all western europe and that had been so well and closely	spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to	the other.	8.821200385463301
3510. even so edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen	that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace	was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that	left england for rome during that period had very little to do with	it.	9.943648485938889
3511. it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures	on the pope.	20.045090511853175
3512. nogaret is hardly an impartial witness and even he	did	not make his charges against boniface until the latter was dead but	there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say.	10.244675429888163
3513. it was not merely a hunger for money gold and precious objects	that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war	to an end; the pope was playing a dangerous game with so many balls	in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears	and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage	of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs.	8.532531923613972
3514. when the	negotiations began his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily	in abeyance and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there	was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who under	charles of valois	the papal vicar of tuscany were so valuable in	the crusade against the colonna cardinals and their sicilian allies.	10.537263206179462
3515. if his circumspection in regard to philip's sensibilities went so	far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of	amadee's daughter agnes to the son of the dauphin of vienne-	a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas for savoy	and dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides- for fear	that he might seem to be favoring the anti-french coalition he would	certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return	of gascony to edward even though as he admitted to the english	ambassadors he had been advised that the original cession was invalid.	7.385759255496054
3516. on the other hand he did not want to offend edward either and	he found himself in a very difficult position.	19.05725460143804
3517. on the surface the whole	question was purely feudal.	18.78066655861408
3518. the french were now occupying gascony	and flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited	them by a breach of the feudal contract.	9.844380310097383
3519. but edward was invading	scotland for precisely the same reason and his insubordinate vassal	was the ally of the king of france.	11.221882646627972
3520. boniface had to uphold the sacredness	of the feudal contract at all costs for it was only as suzerain	of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he had any justification	for his italian wars but in the english-scottish-french triangle	it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one	of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other	two.	9.933898304004465
3521. because of these involvements in the matter at stake boniface	lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification	for the position of arbiter and in retrospect that would	seem to be	sufficient reason why the english embassies to the curia proved	so fruitless.	10.477225745453604
3522. but when the situation was so complicated that even	nogaret one of the principal actors in the drama could misinterpret	the pope's motives it is possible that othon and his companions	equally baffled attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause.	12.405410218866626
3523. this was boniface's monumental tactlessness.	22.67423545109799
3524. tact by	its very derivation implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other	people but the author of clericis laicos and unam sanctam	the wielder of the two swords the papal sun of which the imperial	moon was but a dim reflection the peer of caesar and vice-regent	of christ was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten	what they were like.	9.009840741930043
3525. he was a learned and brilliant man one of the	best jurists in europe and with flashes of penetrating insight and yet	in his dealings with other people particularly when he tried to be	ingratiating he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come	only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives.	8.401332423981794
3526. this lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men	as pierre flotte and his associates that brilliant group of mediocre	men as powicke calls them who provided the brains for the	french embassy that came to rome under the nominal leadership of the	archbishop of narbonne the duke of burgundy and the count of st-pol.	8.276045870231432
3527. they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence	and astuteness they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles	like othon or even the older generation of clerks like hotham and	they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized.	8.032119971068779
3528. boniface was later to explain to the english that robert	of burgundy and guy de st-pol were easy enough to do business with;	it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say	that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing	with them he never knew whether he had to do with a frenchman or	with a devil.	8.99482813461057
3529. to the pope head of the universal church to the duke	of burgundy taking full advantage of his position on the borders	of france and of the empire or to othon who found it quite natural	that he should do homage to edward for tipperary and to the count	of savoy for grandson flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely	incomprehensible.	8.436797424203307
3530. and yet he made no pretense about it; when	the pope trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature said to him	you have already taken normandy.	11.104638426169997
3531. do you want to drive the king	of england from all his overseas possessions?	15.327080028624678
3532.  the frenchman's	answer was a terse vous dites vrai.	15.227221353292695
3533. loyal and unscrupulous	with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies he	outmatched the english diplomats time and time again until by a kind	of poetic justice he fell at the battle of courtrai the victim of	the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings.	7.501638612621395
3534. the	english relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior	diplomatic skill were also hampered in their negotiations by the events	that were taking place at home.	9.047227300785643
3535. the scots had found a new leader	in william wallace and edward's yearly expeditions across the border	called for evermounting taxes which only increased his difficulties	with the barons and the clergy.	7.954697533288071
3536. he was unable to send any more	help to his allies on the continent and during the next few years many	of them left to resist french pressure unaided surrendered to the	inevitable and made their peace with philip.	12.133635510713203
3537. the defeat and death	of adolf	of nassau at the hands of albert of habsburg also worked to	the disadvantage of the english for all the efforts to revive the	anti-french coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with	the new king of the romans.	9.374382360813973
3538. these shifts in alliance and	allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the english	embassy as a whole but also directly involved the two savoyards amadee	and othon.	9.800151151304728
3539. in spite of the armistice negotiated by amadee two	years earlier the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis	of savoy was still going on and although little is known about	it that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle	against french expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict.	8.581049504094093
3540. a second truce had been arbitrated in april 1298 by jean	d'arlay lord of chalon-sur-saone the most staunch of	edward's	burgundian allies and these last were represented in the discussions	at the curia by gautier de montfaucon othon's neighbor and a	member of the vaudois coalition.	8.809006065583182
3541. but although in many of these	discussions othon and amadee might have been tempted to consider	their own interests as well as those of the king edward's confidence	in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders	of the embassy.	11.043803151705337
3542. amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship	with the king but othon who at sixty seems still to have been a simple	knight merited his position solely by his own character and ability.	9.235142590619597
3543. the younger men vere and pembroke who was also edward's	cousin and whose lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that	caused edward of carnarvon's irreverent friend piers gaveston	to nickname him joseph the jew were relatively new to the game	of diplomacy but pontissara had been on missions to rome before	and hotham a man of great learning jocund in speech agreeable	to meet of honest religion and pleasing in the eyes of all and an	archbishop to boot was as reliable and experienced as othon himself.	7.527226597955502
3544. but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two savoyards	were the heads of it for they were the only ones who were empowered	to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision	and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably	absent.	10.926115968399825
3545. this also gave them the unpleasant duty of	being spokesmen for the mission and they could foresee that that would	not be easy.	9.093114162265076
3546. underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and	papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys	was the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert his flemish	allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain	the king of france in return for being given an equally free hand	with the insubordinate scots.	8.68632003749805
3547. this was a doubly bitter blow to the	king.	18.525658415807303
3548. in the eyes of those who still cared for such things it was	a reflection on his honor and it gave further grounds for complaint to	his overtaxed subjects who were already grumbling- although probably	not in latin- non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana.	10.245253595155567
3549. bad relations between england and flanders brought hard times to the	shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded	flemish cities and while the english so far had done no more than	grumble othon had seen what the discontent might lead to for before	he left the low countries the citizens of ghent had risen in protest	against the expense of supporting edward and his troops and the	regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the	nasty little riot that ensued.	7.282007453099133
3550. in all the talk of feudal rights	the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers nor was	it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they passed the florentine	pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from england	and rough flemish cloth the former to be spun and woven by the	arte della lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the arte	della calimala with the pigment recently discovered in asia minor	by one of their members bernardo rucellai the secret of which they	jealously kept for themselves.	8.992921843101715
3551. these chatty merchants made amusing and	instructive traveling companions for their business took them to all	four corners of the globe and florentine gossip had already reached	a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the inferno	will prove.	8.222846840855174
3552. a northern ambassador willing to keep his mouth shut	and his ears open could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead	at the curia.	9.534021508109605
3553. they had other topics of conversation besides	their news from courts and fairs which were of interest to othon	the builder of castles in wales and churches in his native country.	9.243369110295232
3554. behind him lay the low countries where men were still completing	the cathedrals that a later florentine would describe as a malediction	of little tabernacles one on top of the other with so many pyramids	and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all	for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble;	the low countries where the middle ages were to last for	another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy	met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls	of grandson.	9.38214516585638
3555. it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right	people or there were only a few wrong people in the town.	12.006939709294468
3556. alfred wanted	to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build	a larger place.	11.03586056809425
3557. it was a very tempting offer.	33.27638988310653
3558. my father would have done	it if it hadn't been for my mother who had a fear of being in debt	to anyone- even alfred alpert.	10.26338960510636
3559. in spite of his being well	liked there were a few people who were very careful about alfred.	14.5360223879392
3560. they had my mother's	opinion of him: that he was too sharp or a little	too good to be true.	13.673123764567892
3561. one of the people who was afraid of alfred	was his own brother lew.	20.98781052607693
3562. i don't know how and i don't know why	but the two stores the one in margaretville and the one in fleischmanns	that had been set up as a partnership were dissolved separated	from each other.	7.718762905917208
3563. everything was all very friendly except when it came	to harry the youngest brother.	9.97485197972905
3564. alfred who was a good deal older	than harry had treated him like a son and when harry decided to stay	in business with lew instead of going with alfred alfred looked	on the decision as a betrayal.	9.5981950694917
3565. from that day on he never spoke to harry	or to lew or to lew's two boys mort and jimmy.	10.421463598735649
3566. the six	miles between the towns became an ocean and the alperts became a family	of strangers.	11.311263844877574
3567. time went on and everybody got older.	14.154884951224748
3568. i became	fifteen sixteen then twenty and still tessie alpert sat on the	porch with a rose in her hair and alfred got richer and sicker with	diabetes.	9.8674902857708
3569. it was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and	tessie and alfred found out that they didn't know each other.	15.335452173981944
3570. they	were like two strangers.	18.76473495197733
3571. the store was their marriage and when	alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together.	11.224759923335256
3572. tessie	everybody thought was a strong woman but she was only strong because	she had alfred to lean on.	9.767675064957727
3573. and when alfred was forced into his	bed tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home rocking	in her rocker in the living room staring out the window- the rose	still in her hair.	9.108176025026669
3574. tessie could do nothing for alfred.	13.915190642667962
3575. she couldn't	cook or clean or make him comfortable.	13.191163440333188
3576. instead she waited for alfred	to get better and take care of her.	16.510116390958633
3577. spring was life- and	alfred alpert in his sickroom was death.	9.968894989340471
3578. i remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he	could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't.	12.119061979518579
3579. alfred	began to put his affairs in order and he went about it like a man	putting his things into storage.	8.178495856140085
3580. my father who liked alfred very much	was a constant visitor.	12.954580895295313
3581. one day alfred told him that he had decided	to leave everything to me.	14.796287315408168
3582. my father a wise man asked him not	to.	14.425487862748492
3583. he knew alfred liked me; if he wanted to leave me something let	it be a trinket nothing else.	11.649616588745356
3584. by leaving me everything he wouldn't	be doing me a favor my father told him and he didn't want to see	his daughter involved in a lawsuit.	8.99968988512314
3585. he didn't want alfred to leave	me trouble because that's all it would be and alfred understood.	8.309175626645542
3586. alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home.	13.565565096571008
3587. the doctor	wanted him in a hospital; the nearest one was forty miles away	in kingston.	10.955901455339873
3588. the day alfred left his home and fleischmanns he gave	up the convictions of a lifetime.	14.145805159200643
3589. he sent me for meltzer the butcher	whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi.	11.369769600291958
3590. meltzer knew	why i had come for him.	13.037321475654965
3591. solemnly he walked me back to alfred's	house without a word passing between us.	8.834168570742513
3592. he entered the house in silence	walked into alfred's room and closed the door behind him.	15.296365646009535
3593. i	sat down to wait and i watched tessie alpert who hadn't moved	or said a word but kept staring out of the window.	8.760132332055964
3594. for a few minutes	there was nothing to hear.	22.015920506984305
3595. then meltzer's voice quiet calm	strong started the kaddish the prayer for the dead.	10.417641946290379
3596. i could hear	alfred's voice a few words behind meltzer's like a counterpoint	punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation.	12.044639503129956
3597. there was a finality	in the rhythm of the prayer- it was the end of a life the end of hope	and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning.	14.637416949384562
3598. meltzer stayed with alfred and when the door opened they both came	out.	11.893155718716168
3599. alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital.	12.592550687867394
3600. the car was	waiting for him.	21.699038999688373
3601. alfred leaning on meltzer stopped for a minute to	look at tessie.	9.976540319721277
3602. she didn't turn away from the window.	15.980217805686923
3603. alfred nodded	a little nod and went out through the door.	11.045783089245939
3604. outside his brother	harry was waiting for him- he had come to say good-bye.	13.553069198204337
3605. alfred	walked past him without a word and got into the car.	10.480306102904505
3606. harry ran to	the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him begging	him to speak.	11.199221418805493
3607. the car began to move	and harry ran after it crying alfred! alfred! speak to me.	10.043912998705903
3608. but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead.	16.035111449519167
3609. harry	followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards	kingston.	9.070074471681158
3610. he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight.	15.498978345095171
3611. i went to visit alfred in the kingston hospital a few times.	12.873222830517651
3612. the first time i went there he asked me to bring him water from	flagler's well- water that reminded him of his first days in the	mountains- and before i came the next time i filled a five-gallon	jug for him and brought it to the hospital.	11.31511842660677
3613. i don't think he ever	got to drink any of it.	7.2435547354715135
3614. the jug stayed at the hospital and the	water- what can happen to water?	14.326704679754792
3615. - it evaporated disappeared and	came back to the earth as rain- maybe for another well or another	stream or another alfred alpert.	7.240417674695568
3616. mr banks was always called banks the butcher until he left	town and the shop passed over to meltzer the scholar who then became	automatically meltzer the butcher.	9.25355981978049
3617. meltzer was a boarder with the	banks family.	11.118618003375188
3618. he came to fleischmanns directly from the boat that	brought him to america from russia.	13.690240695824762
3619. he was a learned man and a very	gentle soul.	20.393909155463025
3620. he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the talmud.	30.02055315654568
3621. he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak very weak	on the therefores.	14.120848098943808
3622. banks the butcher took meltzer the scholar	as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must	be able to do more than just quote the commentaries of the talmud in	order to live.	10.841705876607605
3623. so meltzer learned a new trade from banks who supplied	the town and the hotels with meat.	9.388560110563343
3624. banks had a family-	a wife a daughter and a son.	11.33819267263277
3625. the daughter lilly was a very good	friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would	find each other.	8.84690917889675
3626. they lived in the same house and it didn't seem	to be such a hard	thing to do but the sad realities of lilly's life	and the fact that meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful	thinking.	10.617876264390993
3627. banks the butcher was a hard master and a hard	father a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living	flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade.	10.087604054546253
3628. he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt;	perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that	hung silently from his hooks.	12.91801102211739
3629. lilly banks and i became friends.	11.867291106449708
3630. she was the opposite of everything she should have been- a positive	pole in a negative home a living reaction of warmth and kindness	to the harsh reality of her father.	9.94394701730471
3631. and lilly's whole family seemed	to be an apology for mr banks.	11.379521036424778
3632. her brother karl was a very gentle	soul her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard	probing eyes.	10.528104102541638
3633. for every rude word of mr banks's the family	had five in apology.	11.753573341409911
3634. every chance i got i left the hotel to	visit lilly.	12.320195342609187
3635. i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even	the coming of meltzer lightened.	11.60847286007131
3636. she had to clean the glass on the	display cases in the butcher shop help her brother scrub the cutting	tables with wire brushes mop the floors put down new sawdust on the	floors and help check the outgoing orders.	9.29146801086889
3637. when these chores were	finished only then was she allowed whatever freedom she could find.	11.167765990195381
3638. i helped lilly in the store.	20.047327121983496
3639. to me it was a game to her it	was the deadly seriousness of life.	12.374287924679294
3640. i wanted to help so that we could	find time to play.	16.888196759322472
3641. and lilly allowed me to help so that she could	have her few little hours of escape.	9.61288450117679
3642. when the work was finished	we would walk.	24.470114030326435
3643. the road past the butcher shop took us along the side	of a stream.	12.19493789904121
3644. it ran north away from the town and the people through	woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard.	15.823337616359785
3645. lilly preferred	the loneliness of that walk.	11.867291106449708
3646. i would have liked the town and the	busyness of its people but i always followed lilly into the peace of	the silent and unstaring road.	13.31305293275767
3647. it wasn't hard to understand.	23.25385709955763
3648. to me lilly was a fine and lovely girl.	15.762042963675972
3649. to people who didn't know	her she was a gawky badly dressed kid whose arms were too long whose	legs were a little too bony.	9.596277872855763
3650. she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed	walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the	street.	11.719521610497223
3651. and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked.	17.628715445924865
3652. it was	unexpected unexpected because lilly walked with her head bent down	down and her mark of friendship was to look into your face.	11.726454702665295
3653. i accepted	her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness; childishness compared	to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as	yet undisclosed sins.	8.651095036257843
3654. we were almost the same age she was fifteen	i was twelve and where i felt there was a life to look forward to lilly	felt she had had as much of it as was necessary.	13.219440706063246
3655. when we	went for our walks lilly's brother would come along every once in	a while.	10.482617320427329
3656. karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it	was strange to see the expected become the unexpected.	10.488846201733642
3657. this huge hulk	played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play	for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream.	8.522044214942818
3658. karl played well	and his favorite song was a schubert lullaby.	11.33819267263277
3659. he spoke no german	but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew	in a foreign language.	11.27769222096734
3660. the song he said was called the stream's	lullaby and when he sang gute ruh gute ruh mach't	die augen zu there was such longing and such simple sadness that	it frightened me.	9.959054375638372
3661. later when i was older i found the song was part	of schubert's die scho^ne mu^llerin.	11.387845862171776
3662. and even hearing	it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and	the melody would make me a little colder and i would reach out for my	husband's hand.	10.225746887910969
3663. the brother and sister seemed to be a sort	of mutual-aid society a little fortress of kindness for each other in	a hard world.	10.3177558850924
3664. i felt very flattered to be included in the protection	of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from.	14.092913849252074
3665. the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decades	preceeding and following it marks a great change in the history of	early english scholarship.	12.864232567995279
3666. at the bottom of this change were great strides	forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the	historian.	16.501800710062675
3667. in archaeology for example the contributions of frederick	haverfield and reginald smith to the various volumes of the victoria	county histories raised the discipline from the status of an	antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the	early english historian.	9.96913363442824
3668. and with the publication of e t leeds'	archaeology of the anglo-saxon settlements the student	was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data	then known.	11.230991191930997
3669. what was true for archaeology was also true of place-name	studies.	13.626752983803105
3670. the value of place-names in the reconstruction of early	english history had long been recognized.	14.917114519993026
3671. place-names in fact	had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of camden	onwards.	9.982951645096612
3672. without a precise knowledge of germanic philology however	it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion	and error than anything else.	9.639890319852716
3673. even in the nineteenth century	such accomplished philologists as kemble and guest were led into what	now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that	modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical	philological development.	9.683286530942015
3674. it was therefore not until the publication	of jh round's the settlement of the south and east	saxons and wh stevenson's dr guest and the english	conquest of south britain that a scientific basis for place-name	studies was established.	11.576188180680285
3675. diplomatic is another area for	which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern	standards of scholarship.	11.38925383859987
3676. although because of the important achievements	of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism	the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology	and place-names the editorial principles laid down by stevenson in	his great edition of asser and in his crawford charters were a	distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved	upon today.	11.830986507546697
3677. in sum it can be said that the techniques and	standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century.	0.0
3678. and it is this particularly the establishment of archaeology and	place-name studies on a scientific basis which are immediately pertinent	to the saxon shore.	15.421211601057676
3679. almost inevitably the first result	of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and	in many cases the conclusions of the oxford school of stubbs freeman	and green regarding the nature of the anglo-saxon	conquest of britain.	8.493703491539538
3680. even before the century was out the tide of	reaction had set in.	14.950070841589172
3681. charles plummer in the introduction and notes to	his splendid edition of bede voiced some early doubts concerning the	elaborate superstructure they raised up over the slim foundations	afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest.	7.328326073935215
3682. it was plummer	in fact who coined the much quoted remark: mr green	indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the saxons	and had watched every step of their subsequent progress.	12.729520309836278
3683. sir henry	howorth writing in 1898 put himself firmly in the lappenburg-kemble	tradition by attacking the veracity of the west saxon annals.	10.03569095316478
3684. early in the present century w h stevenson continued	the attack with a savage article against guest.	0.0
3685. following him in varying	degrees of scepticism were tw shore hm chadwick	thomas hodgkin and f g beck.	9.166811807834467
3686. by 1913 ferdinand lot	could begin an article subtitled la conquete de la grande-bretagne	par les saxons with the words il est difficile aujourd	'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel	de la conquete de la grande-bretagne h.	8.688788421365603
3687. it is also worthy	of note that lot cited both kemble and lappenberg with favor in	that article.	13.80857447041383
3688. it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle.	27.729015065371286
3689. in fact modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated	all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the	nineteenth century.	13.473855412809312
3690. although one meets with occasional extremists like	zachrisson or very recently arthur wade-evans the majority of	scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism	and gullibility.	9.815130079540522
3691. most now admit that bede gildas nennius and	the anglo-saxon chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early	english history that guest freeman and green thought them to be.	8.138610241681686
3692. as rh hodgkin has remarked: the critical methods of	the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque narrative.	12.563838279006772
3693. on	the other hand the consensus of opinion is that used with caution	and in conjunction with other types of evidence the native sources still	provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern	britain.	9.835410059798695
3694. as sir charles oman once said it is no longer fashionable	to declare that we can say nothing certain about old english	origins.	14.807853314767614
3695. therefore in one way kemble and lappenberg	have been vindicated.	13.072918205375863
3696. their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness	of the west saxon annals the confused chronology of bede the	unreliability of the early positions of the anglo-saxon genealogies	and the mythological elements contained in nennius are now mostly accepted.	8.849109410308339
3697. nevertheless in another way modern historians still labor in	the vineyard of the oxford school.	9.423333597346735
3698. for it is their catastrophic concept	of the anglo-saxon invasions rather than kemble's gradualist	approach which dominates the field.	15.509141178453334
3699. despite the rejection of the traditional	accounts on many points of detail as late as 1948 it was still	possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden	influx of germans as the type of invasions.	8.704216734929853
3700. at	this point of course the issue has become complicated by a development	unforeseen by lappenberg and kemble.	10.683075001441855
3701. they however much they were	in disagreement with the late victorians over the method by which	britain was germanized agreed with them that the end result was the	complete extinction of the previous celtic population and civilization.	8.322471590033524
3702. but beginning for all practical purposes with frederick seebohm's	english village community scholars have had to reckon	with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between	roman and anglo-saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning	concept of the anglo-saxon invasions.	9.830768495295192
3703. against seebohm formidable	foes have taken the field notably f w maitland whose	domesday book and beyond was written expressly for this purpose	and sir paul vinogradoff whose the growth of the manor had	a similar aim.	8.44714927202177
3704. largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory	has maintained its position although seebohm has always found	supporters.	9.723773562266802
3705. hl gray in his english field systems and	zachrisson's romans kelts and saxons defended in part the	seebohm thesis while at the present time hpr finberg and	gordon copley seem to fall into the celtic survivalist camp.	0.0
3706. this	is nevertheless a minority view.	19.63613844052011
3707. most scholars while willing to accept	a survival of celtic art forms and a considerable proportion	of the celtic population reject any institutional legacy from	pre-anglo-saxon britain.	8.16966468548336
3708. therefore it is plain that the	clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us.	17.420341011820142
3709. in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars hm	chadwick rh hodgkin sir frank stenton et al	who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest	but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by	them.	8.88223587846767
3710. they in effect have compromised the opposing positions of the	nineteenth century.	13.43850623403577
3711. on the other side are the celtic survivalists who	have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century	thought.	13.200237079954979
3712. as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual	germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of	their work eg seebohm gray and finberg tends to obscure	their sympathies.	12.064383465936814
3713. those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions	in a more general way like tw shore and arthur wade-evans	are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful germanic penetration	into britain.	12.19223561783057
3714. wade-evans in fact denies that there were any anglo-saxon	invasions at all other than a minor jutish foray in ad	514.	9.935181008986339
3715. now omitting for a moment some recent developments	we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of lappenberg and kemble has	undergone virtual eclipse in this century.	8.968987081373632
3716. it is no longer possible	to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the	invasions almost automatically produces a shore occupied by interpretation.	14.05361741869562
3717. everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has	been willing to accept lappenberg or kemble's position on that	point.	8.70515921666629
3718. one reason is of course that the new scepticism has been willing	to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in	the traditional sources.	13.964524252610454
3719. the few scholars who have adopted the shore	occupied by interpretation howorth shore and wade-evans	have all been celtic survivalists.	9.400280577130196
3720. moreover they have done so in rather	special circumstances.	18.68634384228653
3721. the primary reason for the abandonment	of the shore occupied by thesis has been the assimilation and	accumulation of archaeological evidence the most striking feature	of early english studies in this century.	8.862366382842458
3722. again omitting recent developments	et	leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged: so far	as archaeology is concerned there is not the least warrant for the	second of these theories.	11.669395237737792
3723. even earlier haverfield	had come to the same conclusion.	18.056269821220585
3724. what they meant was that there	was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of britain received	germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of	england.	12.438779120190507
3725. that is there was no trace of anglo-saxons in britain	as early as the late third century to which time the archaeological	evidence for the erection of the saxon shore forts was beginning to	point.	8.857344061761403
3726. in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology therefore it	became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the shore settled	by theory.	15.4370440631581
3727. in recent years however a wind of change	seems to be blowing through early english historical circles.	12.73955057840778
3728. the	great increase in the amount of archaeological activity and therefore	information in the years immediately preceeding and following the second	world war has brought to light data which has changed the complection	of the saxon shore dispute.	10.70166684532074
3729. where there were none fifteen years	ago several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards	the acceptance of the shore occupied by position.	10.671328325182275
3730. we must	therefore have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine	the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem.	13.362375197888573
3731. what exactly are we trying to prove?	14.678537531441105
3732.  we know that the	saxon shore was a phenonenon of late roman defensive policy; in	other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain.	11.96709631811562
3733. so	whenever the romans finally withdrew from the island the saxon shore	disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century.	11.886624507777697
3734. we also know	that the saxon shore as reflected in the notitia was created	as a part of the theodosian reorganization of britain	.	14.664817011931127
3735. my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that	time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of carausius.	12.546651084855368
3736. therefore what we must prove or disprove is that there were	saxons in the broad sense in which we must construe the word in	the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore.	12.202927960497538
3737. that is we must find saxons in east anglia kent sussex and	hampshire in the last half of the fourth century.	12.905697877816097
3738. the problem	in other words is strictly a chronological one.	14.310793878502059
3739. in gaul the saxon	element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the	saxons were an intrusive element in the population.	9.0082069863666
3740. in britain obviously	the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the saxon	shore region are bound to be saxon.	11.794370699993864
3741. it is a matter of trying to	sort out an earlier fourth-century saxon element from the later fifth-century	mainstream of anglo-saxon invasions.	13.9767449420763
3742. this naturally will	be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence	in this period with some fortunate exceptions is insufficient	for precise chronological purposes.	9.712333998600402
3743. it might be well to consider	the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer	to one important question; namely is the idea that there were saxon	mercenaries in england at all reasonable?	10.025129667452635
3744. 	to do so something was necessary beyond volunteering because there was	little glamour or romance in the european war; it meant instead	hardship dirt and death.	8.777324869432913
3745. baker gave leonard wood credit for	the initiation of the draft of soldiers; from the general's idea	a chain reaction occurred.	7.9139724503302755
3746. wood took the proposal to chief of staff	hugh l scott who passed it on to baker a month before the actual	declaration of war against germany.	8.935664881287627
3747. the secretary of war gave	his assent after studying the history of the draft in the american	civil war as well as the british volunteer system in world war 1.	12.697482362343406
3748. he concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization	of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable	moral effects of the british reliance on enlistment only- where	the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning	white feathers on reluctant young men orators preaching hate of the	germans and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist	out of motives of revenge and retaliation.	9.01503187093228
3749. baker took the plan	to wilson who said: baker this is plainly right on any ground.	8.450640073948662
3750. start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if i am obliged	to go to congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration.	13.080293549411573
3751. the result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually	ready long before the country knew that the device was to take	the place of the volunteering method which theodore roosevelt favored.	9.417627266474375
3752. before the draft act was passed baker had confidentially briefed	governors sheriffs and prospective draft board members on the administration	of the measure- and the confidence was kept so well that	only one newspaper learned what was going on.	9.269650898309106
3753. it was baker working	through provost marshal enoch crowder and major hugh s	johnson who arranged for a secret printing by the	million of selective service blanks- again before the act was passed-	until corridors in the government printing office were full	and the basement of the washington post office was stacked to the ceiling.	7.936516232261229
3754. general crowder proposed that regular army officers select	the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation; it was baker	who thought of lessening the shock which conscription always brings	to a country by substituting greetings from your neighbors for	the recruiting sergeant and registration in familiar voting places	rather than at military installations.	7.910627592245061
3755. even so the draft act	encountered rough sledding in its progress through the congress.	12.136534707872007
3756. democratic	speaker champ clark saw little difference between a conscript	and a convict.	11.685627036032388
3757. democrat stanley h dent chairman of the	house military affairs committee declined to introduce the bill.	8.450640073948662
3758. democratic floor leader claude kitchin would have no part of the	measure.	11.874164060090717
3759. in the judgment of chief of staff scott it was ironic that	the draft policy of a democratic president aimed at germany had	to be pushed through the house of representatives by the ranking minority	member of the military affairs committee- a republican jew	born in germany! he was julius kahn for whom the chief of staff	thought no honor could be too great.	7.906523249108071
3760. after kahn's death in 1924	scott wrote: may he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude	of his adopted country.	12.118827562579934
3761. in spite of powerful opposition the	draft act finally passed congress on may 17 1917.	12.975306596598324
3762. in early june	ten million young men registered by name and number.	14.174449266743885
3763. the day passed	without incident in spite of the warning of senator james a reed	of missouri: baker you will have the streets of our american	cities running with blood on registration day.	11.592780486277787
3764. on july 20 the	first drawing of numbers occurred in the senate office building before	a distinguished group of congressmen and high army officers.	12.088592376446435
3765. secretary	of war baker blindfolded put his hand into a large glass	bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called.	7.719095379114949
3766. a man in mississippi wired: thanks for drawing 258- that's	me.	18.810589512966207
3767. he was the first of 2800000 called to the army through the	selective service system.	17.74043693596121
3768. it was one thing to call men to the	colors; it was another to house feed and train them.	14.202899577639277
3769. the existing	army posts were wholly inadequate.	15.260583014183545
3770. in a matter of months the war	department built thirty-two camps each one accommodating fifty thousand	men- sixteen were under canvas in the south and sixteen with frame	structures in the north.	12.588537782763375
3771. it was a gargantuan task; a typical	cantonment in the north had twelve hundred buildings an electric-sewer-water	system and twenty-five miles of roads.	12.458523436119087
3772. at camp taylor in kentucky	a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had	been standing in mississippi forests one week before.	13.17300228742428
3773. the total	operation	was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the panama	canal but in 1917 time was in short supply; in three months	the army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended on the big	ditch in ten years.	8.277929675983822
3774. in later years josephus danielswas	to	claim that world war 1 was the first in american history in which	there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers.	13.069727976524035
3775. it was the first american war in which the death rate from disease	was lower than that from battle due to the provision of trained	medical personnel compulsory	vaccination rigorous camp sanitation and adequate hospital	facilities.	11.720847548671518
3776. to the middle of september 1918 there had been fewer than	10000 deaths from disease in the new army.	17.510474033753884
3777. this enviable record	would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which	struck	the world with murderous stealth.	9.130568048735583
3778. it was the influenza pandemic	of 1918-19.	37.418055266756554
3779. the malady was popularly known as the spanish flu	from the alleged locale of its origin.	11.26189007519089
3780. the world-wide total of deaths	from spanish flu was around twenty million; in the united	states 300000 succumbed to it.	11.405218283491637
3781. in mid-september 1918 the influenza-pneumonia	pandemic swept through every american military camp; during	the eight-week blitz attack 25000 soldiers died from the disease	and the death rate increased almost	fifty times to 4 per week per 1000 men.	8.146348881236557
3782. in spite of this catastrophe	the final mortality figure from disease in the american army	during world war 1 was 15 per 1000 per year contrasted with	110 per 1000 per year in the mexican war and 65 in the american civil	war.	12.277341316582637
3783. both secretary of war baker and secretary of navy	daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing	reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of	men who had been removed from their home environment.	8.776867257795377
3784. their policy	ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a	libertine and that in sex affairs god-given passion was a proof	of manliness.	9.570294252539515
3785. baker moved first; six days after war was declared	he appointed raymond fosdick chairman of the commission on training	camp activities.	10.81533599051441
3786. fosdick a brother of minister	harry emerson fosdick was a graduate of princeton and a member of	phi beta kappa and the american philosophical association.	11.865448529567647
3787. his	assignment was not a new one because baker had sent him to the mexican	border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack	of discipline drunkenness and venereal disease in american military	camps.	8.66657510597812
3788. fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of	saloons and houses of prostitution with filles de joie from all	over the country flocking to san antonio laredo and el paso to	woman the cribs.	8.473791467228605
3789. he also ascertained that many officers were	indifferent to the problem including commanding general frederick	funston who gave fosdick the nickname of reverend.	10.535230559416593
3790. on the basis	of the long chronicle of military history funston and his brethren	assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a	mission like fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder.	10.458814712579565
3791. during the brief mexican venture fosdick's report to the	secretary recommended a definite stand by the war department against	the saloon and the excesses of prostitution.	9.902301202724091
3792. the problem involved military	necessity as much as morality for in pre-penicillin days venereal	disease was a crippling disability.	13.484771495712602
3793. fosdick insisted that a strong	word was needed from washington and it was immediately forthcoming.	9.742088144514208
3794. baker put the cribs and the saloons out of bounds ordered the	co-operation of military officers with local law authorities and told	communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions	were restored.	8.90516556096576
3795. both baker and fosdick knew that a substitute was	necessary that a verboten approach was not the real answer.	10.089705343174327
3796. they	were aware that soldiers went to town in more ways than one because	of the monotony of camp life to find the only release available in	the absence of movies reading rooms and playing fields with adequate	athletic equipment.	9.296351231732928
3797. both knew that when trains stopped at texan crossroads	bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if	they had any reading material to spare even a newspaper.	7.6805848723165395
3798. there was	no time in the short mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the	area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future.	12.552226854321821
3799. when the united states entered the first world war baker	made certain that the draft act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor	to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps	in which prostitution was outlawed.	10.603115059563622
3800. even so fosdick as the new	chairman of the commission on training camp activities encountered	strong and vociferous opposition.	14.350499992381096
3801. new orleans had a notorious red-light	district extending over twenty-eight city blocks and the business-minded	mayor of the city journeyed to washington to present the	case for the god-given right of men to be men.	8.42787947260908
3802. in europe premier	clemenceau showing his animal proclivities as the tiger of	france asked pershing by letter for the creation of special houses	where the sexual desires of american men could be satisfied.	10.48826849829031
3803. when	fosdick showed the letter to baker his negative response was: for	god's sake raymond don't show this to the president or	he'll stop the war.	8.547875249341322
3804. ultimately fosdick's fit to fight	slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district	in the united states was closed a hundred and ten of them.	12.632644249020515
3805. the	result was that the rate of venereal disease in the american army	was the lowest in our military history.	10.721107303423995
3806. this was the negative	side of the situation.	28.297907460129245
3807. affirmatively baker worked on the premise that	young men spontaneously prefer to be decent and that opportunities	for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities	in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations.	7.673752029006506
3808. the wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including	the ymca the knights of columbus the jewish welfare	board the american library association and the playground and	recreation association- private societies which voluntarily performed	the job that was taken over almost entirely by the special services	division of the army itself in world war 2.	9.097480850202931
3809. over these	voluntary agencies in 1917-18 the ctca served as a co-ordinating	body in carrying out what survey called the most stupendous	piece of social work in modern times.	8.615059805733186
3810. under fosdick the first	executive officer of the ctca was richard byrd whose name in	later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes.	10.20198897279547
3811. from the point of view of popularity the best-known member of	the commission was walter camp the yale athlete whose sobriquet	was the father of american football.	10.036305697089594
3812. he was placed in charge of	athletics and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics known	as the daily dozen.	13.709374952630588
3813. the ctca program of activities was profuse:	william farnum and mary pickford on the screen elsie janis	and harry lauder on the stage books provided by the american	library association full equipment for games and sports- except that	no bones were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played	on any floor and known as african golf.	7.58667664129348
3814. the ctca distributed	a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited	renditions of the selections found therein plus a number of others	whose lyrics were more earthy- from johnny get your gun to	keep the home fires burning to mademoiselle from armentieres.	8.905097240988033
3815. in the imagination of the nineteenth century the greek tragedians and	shakespeare stand side by side their affinity transcending all the	immense contrarieties of historical circumstance religious belief and	poetic form.	12.930334846460218
3816. we no longer use the particular terms of lessing	and victor hugo.	15.321685707098714
3817. but we abide by their insight.	22.47706267988082
3818. the word tragedy	encloses for us in a single span both the greek and the elizabethan	example.	13.855257688737604
3819. the sense of relationship overreaches the historical	truth that shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual	works of aeschylus sophocles and euripides.	9.713158381059479
3820. it transcends the	glaring fact that the elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas	the greeks kept the two modes severely distinct.	12.697026961642726
3821. it overcomes our emphatic	awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the	two languages and styles of dramatic presentation.	12.588836520024199
3822. the intimations of	a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any	sense of disparity.	11.026675696446196
3823. comparable visions of life are at work in antigone	and romeo and juliet.	9.192705502239976
3824. we see at once what victor hugo	means when he calls macbeth a northern scion of the house of atreus.	13.406429631779487
3825. elsinore seems to lie in a range of mycenae and the fate of orestes	resounds in that of hamlet.	9.573684258706386
3826. the hounds of hell search out their	quarry in apollo's sanctuary as they do in the tent of richard 3.	13.372975198384887
3827. oedipus and lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness.	10.542676094873617
3828. it it not between euripides and shakespeare that the western	mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life.	12.666608066716472
3829. it is after	the late seventeenth century.	28.377235298007196
3830. i say the late seventeenth century because	racine stands on the far side	of the chasm.	15.33795679601783
3831. the image of man which enters into force with aeschylus	is still vital in phedre and athalie.	12.299574401423175
3832. it is the	triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point	of no return.	16.42378929693989
3833. shakespeare is closer to sophocles than he is to pope	and voltaire.	14.507422949066763
3834. to say this is to set aside the realness of time.	19.10010501930574
3835. but	it is true nevertheless.	25.410777313215416
3836. the modes of the imagination implicit in	athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age	of descartes and newton.	14.606453541687603
3837. it is only then that the ancient habits	of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience	were abandoned.	13.03298652947806
3838. with the discours de la methode and the	principia the things undreamt of in horatio's philosophy seem	to pass from the world.	11.361477376821597
3839. in greek tragedy as in shakespeare	mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man.	10.694184739355702
3840. the reality	of orestes entails that of the furies; the weird sisters wait	for the soul of macbeth.	12.591381973032304
3841. we cannot conceive of oedipus without a	sphinx nor of hamlet without a ghost.	11.61546602894831
3842. the shadows cast by the personages	of greek and shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness.	11.867210091086676
3843. and the entirety of the natural world is party to the action.	13.985742872590475
3844. the thunderclaps over the sacred wood at colonus and the storms in	king lear are caused by more than weather.	10.834326386071012
3845. in tragedy lightning	is a messenger.	19.735694605127364
3846. but it can no longer be so once benjamin franklin	has flown a kite to it.	20.508164748162333
3847. the	tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and	hell.	9.669550099771405
3848. those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace	or damnation.	13.028875451397203
3849. oedipus and lear instruct us how little of	the world belongs to man.	9.070074471681158
3850. mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous	watch and to all sentinels whether at elsinore or on the battlements	at mycenae the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle.	9.482478153800749
3851. it	banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose.	10.530932308755343
3852. but at the touch of	hume and voltaire the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted	the mind since agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance disappeared	altogether or took tawdry refuge among the gaslights of melodrama.	10.731720590348235
3853. modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to	purgatory.	11.64265507223918
3854. in athens in shakespeare's england and at	versailles the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest.	11.794370699993864
3855. the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre.	11.717792340103959
3856. from it spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the	common man.	12.659159953820822
3857. tragedy presumes such a configuration.	12.851133807717682
3858. its sphere is that	of royal courts dynastic quarrels and vaulting ambitions.	11.815485504043828
3859. the same	metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to oedipus	and macbeth because they applied also to alcibiades and essex.	8.674870936306482
3860. and	the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public.	12.695934191639111
3861. agamemnon	creon and medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes	of the polis.	9.070074471681158
3862. similarly the sufferings of hamlet othello	or phedre engage the fortunes of the state.	11.351647747808283
3863. they are enacted at the	heart of the body politic.	17.802313136824733
3864. hence the natural setting of tragedy is the	palace gate the public square or the court chamber.	11.791527870581819
3865. greek and elizabethan	life and to a certain extent the life of versailles shared	this character of intense publicity.	9.339010842554865
3866. princes and factions clashed	in the open street and died on the open scaffold.	11.461944118285162
3867. with the	rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs	shifted from the public to the private.	13.610959163235096
3868. the art of defoe and richardson	is founded on an awareness of this great change.	17.461919154729003
3869. heretofore	an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high	personages and if it occurred in the public view.	10.088754744996828
3870. behind the tragic	hero stands the chorus the crowd or the observant courtier.	12.579710649622275
3871. in the	eighteenth century there emerges for the first time the notion of a	private tragedy	number of elizabethan domestic tragedies such as the famous arden	.	12.004430967458266
3872. in la nouvelle-heloi^se and werther	tragedy is made intimate.	17.034822554424267
3873. and private tragedy became the chosen ground	not of drama but of the new unfolding art of the novel.	12.242791121665332
3874. the novel was not only the presenter of the new secular rationalistic	private world of the middle class.	17.916031585430687
3875. it served also as a literary form	exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture.	10.829199914662594
3876. i have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements	with regard to the character of the greek and elizabethan public.	19.55242447432118
3877. but one major fact seems undeniable.	21.11290113259676
3878. until the advent of rational	empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic	and allegoric.	13.666020651385168
3879. available evidence regarding the natural world the	course of history and the varieties of human action were translated	into imaginative designs or mythologies.	8.424415450715127
3880. classic mythology and christianity	are such architectures of the imagination.	11.793662721363662
3881. they order the manifold	levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which	extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars.	8.588365825225
3882. there had not yet	supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of	mathematics and scientific formulas.	15.004540007728046
3883. the poet was by definition a realist	his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality.	9.646584389395406
3884. and in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant	part radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole	toward which all perspectives converge.	13.285912329596902
3885. i mean such concepts as the presence	of the supernatural in human affairs the sacraments of grace	and divine retribution the idea of preordainment	the prophecy of the witches to macbeth or god's covenant with	.	8.496308937694899
3886. i refer to the notion that the structure	of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history	conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality	play set in motion by the gods for our instruction.	11.096712547292709
3887. these	conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or	engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time	of aeschylus to that of shakespeare.	9.694256913878332
3888. and although they were as i	have indicated under increasing strain at the time of racine they	are still alive in his theatre.	14.31480816791822
3889. they are the essential force behind	the conventions of tragedy.	16.74534619098603
3890. they are as decisively present in the oresteia	and oedipus as in macbeth king lear and phedre.	13.80043266152703
3891. after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to	be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits	of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar.	8.94554005849344
3892. concepts	such as grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of	being which are everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy	lose their vitality.	9.051154372622117
3893. they become philosophic abstractions of	a private and problematic relevance or mere catchwords in religious customs	which had in them a diminishing part of active belief.	8.350369773860487
3894. after shakespeare	the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer	the blind seers the poets or orpheus performing his art in the face	of hell.	9.872309018460065
3895. they are descartes newton and voltaire.	19.23144912003902
3896. and their chroniclers	are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists.	13.847265734140931
3897. the	romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change.	10.057988591011652
3898. they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable.	25.268576800264263
3899. rousseau's	primitivism the anti-newtonian mythology of blake coleridge's	organic metaphysics victor hugo's image of the poets as the magi	and shelley's unacknowledged legislators are related elements	in the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against the new	scientific rationalism.	7.404315842331646
3900. from this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting	greek and shakespearean drama into a new total form capable	of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses.	10.500363219752513
3901. the dream	of achieving a synthesis between the sophoclean and the shakespearean	genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time	of shelley and victor hugo to that of bayreuth.	8.35266804339194
3902. it could not really	be fulfilled.	39.29379647642292
3903. the conventions into which the romantics tried to breath	life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling.	10.434399572520682
3904. but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works and	these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age	of ibsen and chekhov.	12.861276903808378
3905. the wedding of the hellenic to the northern	genius was one of the dominant motifs in goethe's thought.	12.505862827467698
3906. his	italian journey was a poet's version of those perennial thrusts	across the alps of the german emperors of the middle ages.	10.818667212171446
3907. the dream	of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew german ambitions	toward rome and sicily.	12.093488559070714
3908. goethe asks in wilhelm meister	whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower and the light	of the mediterranean glows through torquato tasso and the roman	elegies.	9.141071651479482
3909. goethe believed that the germanic spirit with its	grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance should	be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the hellenic.	7.409221547716014
3910. on the narrower ground of poetic form he felt that in the drama	of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to	the shakespearean vision of tragic will.	11.03383315509481
3911. the wager between god and	satan brings on the destiny of faust but faust assumes his role	voluntarily.	9.646069374099351
3912. the third act of faust 2 is a formal celebration	of the union between the germanic and the classic between	the spirit of euripides and that of romantic drama.	10.052218951896311
3913. the motif of faust's	love for helen of troy goes back to the sources of the faustian	legend.	15.430209215013011
3914. it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest	wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty.	14.519827943384263
3915. there can be no greater	magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all in whom	beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible.	10.48979599058333
3916. it is	thus that the brightness of helen passes through marlowe's faustus.	16.179913762157334
3917. goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends.	10.530932308755343
3918. faust rescuing	helen from menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance europe	restoring to life the classic tradition.	9.723773562266802
3919. the necromantic change from	the palace at sparta to faust's gothic castle directs us to the	aesthetic meaning of the myth- the translation of antique drama into	shakespearean and romantic guise.	8.386367925120217
3920. this translation or rather	the fusion of the two ideals creates the gesamtkunstwerk	the total art form.	12.3726915958353
3921. the bishop of gloucester described the elder thomas in 1577 as the	richest recusant in his diocese worth five hundred pounds a year in	lands and goods.	8.091940198210692
3922. when quiney and william parsons wrote to greville	in 1593 asking his consent in the election for bailiff they sent the	letter to mr william sawnders attendant on the worshipful mr	thomas bushell at marston.	9.627403011164123
3923. mr bushell was mentioned in 1602	in the will of joyce hobday widow of a stratford glover.	10.472773421425158

3926. his son thomas	aged fifteen when he entered oxford in 1582 married as his first wife	margaret sister of sir edward greville.	10.512073625513276
3927. bridges a son by his	second wife was christened at pebworth in 1607 but thomas the younger	was living at packwood two years later and sold broad marston	manor in 1622.	8.004571684597144
3928. a third thomas bushell much loved	by bacon called himself the superlative prodigall in the	first part of youths errors and became an expert on silver	mines and on the art of running into debt.	10.68942320689594
3929. edward greville	born about 1565 had inherited milcote on the execution of his father	lodowick for murder in 1589.	8.352233589850186

3934. greville proposed quiney as	the fittest man for the following of the cause and to attend him in	the matter and at his suggestion the corporation allowed quiney	two shillings a day.	10.764471110674585
3935. if you can firmly make the good knight sure	to pleasure our corporation sturley wrote besides that ordinary	allowance for your diet you shall have 20 for recompence.	10.51770362015475
3936. in his letter mentioning shakespeare on january 24 15978 sturley	asked quiney especially that theare might be bi sir ed	grev some meanes made to the knightes of the parliament for	an ease and discharge of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne	is like to be charged and i assure u i am in great feare and doubte	bi no meanes hable to paie.	8.815156778894488

3946. this refers to what had happened after the earl of warwick	died in 1590 when the town petitioned burghley for the right to	name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but greville bought	the lordship for himself.	9.535895467854612

3978. after returning to stratford he drew up a	defense	of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it	and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and shakespeare's	father.	10.066048042601844
3979. no one he wrote took any corn of greville's for	his bailiff of husbandry swore a greate oathe thatt who soe came	to put hys hande into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande	be hynde hym.	7.724657573312051
3980. quiney was in london again in june 1601 and in	november when he rode up as shakespeare must often have done by way	of oxford high wycombe and uxbridge and home through aylesbury	and banbury.	8.291920649049274
3981. after quiney was elected bailiff in september	1601 without greville's approval greene wrote him that coke	had promised to be of counsel for stratford and had advised that	the office of bayly may be exercised as it is taken upon you	.	8.24856342325797
3982. asked	by	the townsmen to cease his suit greville had answered that hytt	shulde coste hym f first + sayed it must be tried ether before my lorde	anderson in the countrey or his uncle ffortescue in the exchequer	with whom he colde more prevaile then we.	8.244876954206687
3983. the corporation proposed	chief justice anderson for an arbiter sending him a gift of sack	and claret.	10.744294445561385
3984. lady greville daughter of the late lord chancellor	bromley and niece of sir john fortescue was offered twenty pounds	by the townsmen to make peace; she labored + thought she shuld	effecte it but her husband said that we shuld wynne it by the sworde.	8.800059566572779
3985. his servant robin whitney threatened quiney who had whitney	bound to the good abaringe to keep the peace.	9.4561356977336
3986. a report of	f edw: grevyles minaces to the baileefe aldermen + burgesses	of stratforde tells how quiney was injured by greville's men:	in the tyme f ryc' quyney was bayleefe ther came some of	them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher	thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the	baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order + comminge by	in	f hurley burley.	7.881123534835891
3987. came into the howse + commawnded the peace to be	kept butt colde nott prevayle + in hys endevor to sticle the brawle had	his heade grevouselye brooken by one of hys greville's men whom	nether hym selfe greville punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished	but with a shewe to turne them awaye + enterteyned agayne.	7.2409731048188055
3988. the fall of rome the discovery of precious metals and the protestant	reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood	by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed.	9.435723362429936
3989. often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct	by those individuals or nations which he is studying.	10.067872361127787
3990. unconsciously	governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking	without fully realizing why they are doing so.	9.949043896514427
3991. they react in obedience	to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural	law.	9.92799960869505
3992. a court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling	that the law is inimical to the numerical majority.	12.033100850115433
3993. a nation may	go to war on some trifling pretext when in reality it may have been	guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake.	8.467907667334694
3994. when	the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible	cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious	instinct as possible guides.	10.879426254930754
3995. adams firmly contended	that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical	environment on history.	9.294657860348424
3996. here was another indispensable tool.	30.23437949304722
3997. indeed	he concluded that geographical conditions have exercised a great	possibly a preponderating influence over man's destiny.	8.450640073948662
3998. the failure	of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens	had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical	conformation.	10.72625815352673
3999. all areas of history were either favorably or adversely	affected by the geographical environment and no respectable historian	could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of	geography.	9.183177096468363
4000. brooks adams was consistent in his admonishments	to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess.	9.599218841280045
4001. however as a practicing historian he himself has left few clues	to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing	history.	9.611699723253004
4002. in fact if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness	of his historicism they must be based on scanty evidence.	14.522047823664575
4003. what evidence	is available would seem to indicate that brooks unlike his older	brother henry had most of the methodological vices usually found	in the amateur.	11.282839684924364
4004. a credulousness a distaste for documentation an uncritical	reliance on contemporary accounts and a proneness to assume	a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences	of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate	the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public.	8.917078238613783
4005. this	is not to assume that his work was without merit but the validity	of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be	considered against this background of an unprofessional approach.	8.873557026233753
4006. his credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the	emancipation of massachusetts which purports to examine the	trials of moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the israelite	exodus from egypt and the leadership of the puritan clergy in	colonial new england.	10.225131859636846
4007. much criticism has been leveled at this rather	forced analogy but what is equally significant is adams' complete	acceptance of the biblical record as good and trustworthy history.	8.709871024268203
4008. in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher	criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming	from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views.	12.83927380196016
4009. the desire	to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique	smacks more of	the propagandist than the historian.	10.343336487412788
4010. a similar amateurish	characteristic is revealed in adams' failure to check the	accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources.	10.788862536317781
4011. if he found data	that fitted his general plan he used it and counted his sources trustworthy.	12.005731854753032
4012. conversely if statistics were uncovered which contradicted	a cherished theory the sources were denounced as faulty.	9.908939338115298
4013. such manipulations	are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression	of the monasteries during the english reformation.	9.28510455277153
4014. adams depended largely	on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in england	claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because	there were no newspapers.	9.801722102940747
4015. this is certainly an irrational dogmatism	in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth	century on twentieth-century terms.	13.314970119283027
4016. moreover he rejects the	contemporary accounts of englishmen casually adjudging them to be distorted	by prejudice because the opinions of englishmen are of no	great value.	10.249525335014722
4017. what is exposited by this observation is not the inherent	prejudices of englishmen but the anglophobia of brooks adams.	11.17851537401088
4018. in all fairness it must be admitted that adams made no pretense	at being an impartial historian.	14.500118814300233
4019. impartiality to him meant an unwillingness	to generalize and to search for a synthesis.	9.304861537289883
4020. he deplored the	impact of german historiography on the writing of history terming	it a dismal monster.	12.21204982240423
4021. ranke and his disciples had reduced history	to a profession of dullness; brooks adams preferred the chronicles	of froissart or the style and theorizing of edward gibbon for	at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote.	7.034978856337534
4022. he wrote	eloquently to william james that impartial history was not only	impossible but undesirable.	12.698437526613032
4023. if the historian was convinced of his own	correctness then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by	disturbing facts.	10.76221013748968
4024. it was history that must be in error not the historian.	19.63254559479157
4025. it was this basic trait that separated adams from the ranks	of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what	was his most serious offense against the historical method- namely	the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting	it to the test of facts.	8.414636412867775
4026. all of adams' work reflects this	dogmatic characteristic.	22.38442805853881
4027. no page seems to be complete without the statement	of at least one unproved generalization.	12.457314794049376
4028. one example of this	was his assertion that h all servile revolts must be dealt with by	physical force.	12.406318360696153
4029. there is no explanation of terms nor a qualification	that most such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a bald	dogmatism that they must because of some undefined compulsion be	so repelled.	10.414032169852524
4030. on matters of race he was similarly inflexible: most	of the modern latin races seem to have inherited h the rigidity	of the roman mind.	11.12123250827898
4031. he cites the french revolution as typifying	this rigidity but makes no mention of the italians who have been able	to	adapt to all types of circumstances.	9.849942619390252
4032. he pontificates that one	of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value	of women in men's eyes.	11.419291352653845
4033. it made no difference that most evidence	points to an opposite conclusion.	15.166168101843144
4034. for adams had made up his mind before	all the facts were available.	14.057144796092455
4035. all critics of adams and	his methods have observed this particular deficiency.	11.03807633186204
4036. j t shotwell	was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the	fall of the carolingian empire to the woolen trade and he urged adams	to transform his essay into a real history embodying not merely	those facts which fit into his theory but also the modifications	and exceptions.	8.430500186080765
4037. a m wergeland called the adams method literally	antihistorical while clive day maintained that the assumptions	were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight	factual evidence.	8.666714188986195
4038. moreover stated day he always omits	facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis.	12.385487267806257
4039. even d a wasson	who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the lifting	of a fog from ancient landscapes was also forced to admit the methodological	deficiencies of the author.	8.14280903290637
4040. in summary brooks adams	felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered	was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature.	11.811041422287405
4041. moreover he believed that most professional historians lacked some	of the essential instruments for a proper study of history.	10.008408282470514
4042. however	despite the insight of many of his observations his own conclusions	are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the	correct research methods.	11.099113801997682
4043. this should not prejudice an evaluation of	his findings but they were not the findings of a completely impartial	investigator.	11.587068334485355
4044. what was perhaps more important than his concept of	the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which	shaped the direction of his thought.	13.469671057317164
4045. in the final analysis his contribution	to american historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights	into religion economics and darwinism the three factors which	conditioned his search for a law of history.	9.515449166745022
4046. brooks adams considered religion as an extremely significant	manifestation of man's fear of the unknown.	10.365291799692745
4047. but it was nothing	more than that.	31.732146340986674
4048. religion and the churches were institutions which	had been created by man not god.	11.049330415611552
4049. he did not deny god; he simply	did not believe that a creator intervened or interfered in human	affairs.	13.283243727077622
4050. the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems	suggested by religion.	16.50021198356306
4051. there was no evidence either of a positive	or negative type of the actions of a divine being in this world;	and since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial	activity his research should eliminate the supernatural.	9.604236135172096
4052. furthermore	he must regard religion as the expression of human forces.	11.33819267263277
4053. certainly he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its	influence on the flow of history but he must not confuse the natural	and the mundane with the divine.	8.303589482151606
4054. adams was not breaking new ground	when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality	a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment.	9.179871000155046
4055. students	of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that	there was indeed a direct connection.	9.51786758101864
4056. but adams was one of the first	to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor	behind religion.	16.61927654743345
4057. it was this fear which explained the development	of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease	the angry deities.	10.827052243750234
4058. to keep themselves entrenched in power the	priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle.	11.467785906354605
4059. it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business.	24.718623385788533
4060. the german barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example:	the germans in the fourth century were a very simple	race who comprehended little of natural laws and who therefore referred	phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention.	10.121748654562419
4061. this intervention could only be controlled by priests and thus the	invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class.	10.15953692925924
4062. the	power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the	miracle and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as	did elijah.	9.051154372622117
4063. adams contended that once such a special class	had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain	itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between	god and man.	7.639989688350249
4064. thus the church was born and because of its intrinsic	character was soon identified as a conservative institution determined	to resist the forces of change to identify itself with the political	rulers and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses.	9.931866661088199
4065. doctrine was not only mysterious; it was also sacred and no	believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined	as we should examine human laws.	7.855698086666683
4066. these basic ideas concerning the	nature of religion were adams believed some of the major keys to	the understanding of history and the movement of society.	11.877276074896624
4067. the dark views	about the puritans found in the emancipation of massachusetts	were never altered.	12.26566025977324
4068. despite their adherence to the status	quo the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments	as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge.	10.547996980705001
4069. in the	law of civilization and decay brooks adams traced this evolution	always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more	rational the substance remained unchanged.	10.53964324905203
4070. the relic worship and monasticism	of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive	fetish worship and nature myths.	10.995003513046813
4071. yet the idea imbedded in each	was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that	class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of god.	9.455697751481342
4072. to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire	culture of the race was one of imagination and it is largely the	admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar	religiosity- a sentiment he would have probably denied.	11.680554279411437
4073. stephens had written his classic incidents of travel about these	regions a hundred years before and catherwood who had studied piranesi	in london and the great ruins of egypt and greece had drawn	the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text.	7.091119779706492
4074. catherwood an	architect in new york had been forgotten like stephens and victor	reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs for a museum a dinosaur	from two or three petrified bones.	9.721941267489914
4075. he had unearthed stephens's	letters in a new jersey farmhouse and he discovered stephens's	unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of new york where	the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic.	11.706584589604722
4076. victor had been stirred by my account of him in makers and finders	for stephens was one of the lost writers whom melville had seen	in his childhood and whom i was bent on resurrecting.	10.110488713698617
4077. victor	had led an adventurous life.	12.851133807717682
4078. his metier was the american tropics	and he had lived all over latin america and among the primitive	tribes on the amazon river.	9.883640352937167
4079. well he knew the sleepless nights the howling	sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the	kofanes and huitotoes.	9.63785267807111
4080. he had not yet undertaken the great exploit	of his later years the rediscovery of the ancient inca highway the	route of pizarro in peru but he had climbed to the original el dorado	the andean lake of guatemala and he had scaled the southern sierra	nevada with its tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald	mines of muzo.	9.368280029447298
4081. as a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters	of the amazon he had collected specimens for mexican museums	and he had taken to the london zoo a live quetzal the sacred bird of	the old mayans.	8.806140009192937
4082. in fact he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in	the forest of ecuador.	15.94075967136904
4083. moreover he had spent six months on the galapagos	islands among the great turtles that captain cook had found	there and now and then he would disappear into some small island of	the west indies.	8.803937526074924
4084. victor's book on john lloyd stephens was largely	written in my study in the house at weston.	11.427266620349702
4085. i had had my	name taken out of the telephone book and this was partly because of	a convict who had been discharged from sing sing and who called me night	after night.	10.971027634201926
4086. he said he was a friend of heywood broun who had	run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression	but the generous broun to whom i wrote did not know his name and i	somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling	round the house.	11.4136918374439
4087. but one day came the voice of a man i had known	when he was a boy and i later remembered that this boy thirty years	before had struck me as coming to no good.	10.374486469579782
4088. there had been something	sinister about him that warned me against him- i had never felt	that way about any other boy- but when he uttered his name on the	telephone i had forgotten this and i was glad to do what he asked of	me.	10.165224275508994
4089. he was a captain he said in the army and on the train to new	york his purse and all his money had been stolen and would i lend	him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the general delivery window?	10.884722295344698
4090. 	never hearing from him again i remembered the little boy of whom	i had had such doubts when he was ten years old.	10.595711204166568
4091. we lived for a	while in a movie melodrama with a german cook and her son who turned	out to be nazis.	9.37063947254316
4092. finally we got them out of the house after the boy	had run away four times looking for other nazis threatening to murder	village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next fu^hrer.	14.806542231982293
4093. then he began to have epileptic fits.	21.569581647370594
4094. we found that a charitable	society in new york had a long case-history of the two; and	they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody	else's soup.	12.685516644017278
4095. to the weston house came once william allen	neilson the president of smith college who had been one of my old	professors and who still called me boy when i was sixty.	10.066056128204611
4096. it	reminded me of my other professor edward kennard rand of whom i	had been so fond when i was at harvard the great mediaevalist and	classical scholar who had asked me to call him ken saying age	counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life sub	specie aeternitatis.	8.739175167754032
4097. i had always thought of that lovable man	as many years older than myself although he was perhaps only twenty	years older and he confirmed my feeling along with the feeling of both	my sons that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing.	9.005151683795626
4098. i	must have written to say how much i had enjoyed his fine book the	building	of eternal rome and i found he had not regretted giving	me the highest mark in his old course on the later latin poets although	in my final examination i had ignored the questions and filled the	bluebook with a comparison of propertius and coleridge.	8.336315785312918
4099. he had written	to me about a dinner he had had with the benedictine monks at st	anselm's priory in washington.	10.160125827703322
4100. there had been reading at table	especially from two books pope gregory the great's account	of st scholastica in his dialogues and my own the world	of washington irving.	11.464638579245348
4101. he said some have criticized your book	as	being neither literary criticism nor history.	14.004078131047429
4102. of course it was not	meant to be.	27.252914693096848
4103. some have felt that washington irving comes out rather	slimly but let them look at the title of the book.	12.097227370601608
4104. he felt as	i felt about this best of all my books that it was really tops.	14.612926756647676
4105. two or three times c c burlingham came to lunch with	us in weston that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred	years old and whose birthplace had been my wall street suburb.	9.288819001187157
4106. his	reading ranged from agatha christie to the book of job and he had	an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures while his letters were	full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom	he had been intimately thrown six decades before.	7.968199748134321
4107. i could never forget	the gaiety with which when he was both blind and deaf he let me	lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures; and once	when he came to see us in new york he walked away in a rainstorm	unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella although he was at the	time ninety years old.	8.61887992455279
4108. there were several men of ninety or more whom	i knew first or last all of whom were still productive and most of	whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex	of their lives.	12.840805205270968
4109. i never met john dewey whose style was a sort	of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to mexico with him	when he was investigating the cause of trotsky; but i liked to think	of him at ninety swimming and working at key west long after hemingway	had moved to cuba.	8.321541664749143
4110. at lee simonson's house i had dined	with edith hamilton the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar	who had a great popular success with the greek way.	9.89562103906974
4111. then	there was mark howe and there was henry dwight sedgwick an accomplished	man of letters who wrote in the spirit of montaigne and produced	in the end a formidable body of work.	9.53007799764724
4112. i saw sedgwick often before	his death at ninety-five- he had remarried at the age of ninety-	and he asked me when once i returned from rome if i knew the	cavallinis in the church of st cecilia in trastevere.	11.946109812847476
4113. i had to	confess that i had missed these frescoes recently discovered that	he had studied in his eighties.	11.69057676354504
4114. sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy	of epicurus whom with his followers dante put in hell; but	he defended the doctrine in the art of happiness and what indeed	could be said against the epicurean virtues health frugality	privacy culture and friendship?	9.543406171511664
4115.  of mark antony de wolfe howe	the philosopher whitehead said the earth's first visitors to mars	should be persons likely to make a good impression and when he was	asked whom would you send?	8.631719575745958
4116.  he replied my first choice	would be mark howe.	16.477994707361407
4117. this friend of many years came once to visit	us in the house at weston.	12.085758208962561
4118. then i spoke at the ninetieth birthday	party of w e burghardt du bois who embarked on a fictional	trilogy at eighty-nine and who with the crisis had created a	negro intelligentsia that had never existed in america before him.	9.013147367474806
4119. as	their interpreter and guide he had broken with tuskegee and become	a spokesman of the coloured people of the world.	8.946527821336652
4120. mr burlingham-	ccb- wrote to me once about an old friend	of mine s k ratcliffe whom i had first met in london in	1914 and who also came out for a week-end in weston.	9.600866564002594
4121. did you ever	know a man with greater zest for information?	14.502535970470122
4122.  and his memory like	an elephant's stored with precise knowledge of men and things and	happenings.	11.923800709004192
4123. his wife katie as gay as a lark and as lively	as a gazelle- she was then seventy-six- had a a sense of humour	that has been denied sk but neither has any aesthetic perceptions.	7.847382669458437
4124. people and books are enough for them.	17.002572844858882
4125. sk was visiting	ccb and not waiting for breakfast he was off to	the university club where he spent hours writing obituaries of living	americans for the manchester guardian or the glasgow herald.	7.401214483142368
4126. later rising ninety he was beset by publishers for the story	of his life and miracles as he put it but calling himself the needy	knife-grinder he had spent his time writing short articles and long	letters and could not get even a small popular book done.	8.96212408791683
4127. then all	but blind he said there was nothing in back to methuselah-	gbs ought to have known that- and i look at my	bookshelves despairingly knowing that i can have nothing more to do	with them.	8.07862694829301
4128. however at eighty-five he had still been busy writing	articles reviewing and speaking and i had never before known an	englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the united	states.	9.80128534076016
4129. finally colleges and clubs took the line that speakers	from england were not wanted any longer even speakers like sk	so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the americans	for many years.	7.620734771005392
4130. with their facile generalizations about the united	states these mediocrities as they often were had been great successes.	12.216851453164256
4131. while sk did not like dylan thomas i liked his poems	very much but i made the mistake of telling dylan thomas so whereupon	he said to me i suppose you think you know all about me.	7.750331614302771
4132. i should have replied i probably know something about the best	part of you.	15.40126749799498
4133. but i only thought of that in the middle of the night.	29.796087401151286
4134. many years later i went to see sk in england where	he was living at whiteleaf near aylesbury and he showed me beside	his cottage there the remains of the road on which boadicea is supposed	to have travelled.	12.068009281904446
4135. he was convinced that george orwell's 1984	was nearly all wrong as it applied to england which was driving	forward into uncharted waters with the danger of a new tyranny	ahead.	10.203875365092882
4136. but however we go whatever our doom it will not take the	orwellian shape.	15.879953693742243
4137. with facts mainly in his mind he was often acute	in the matter of style and he said the young who have as yet	nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines.	10.10298451489792
4138. but put them before a situation which they are forced to depict-	he was speaking of the spanish civil war- and they have no hesitation;	they merely do their best to make it real for others.	11.673430040219227
4139. he looked at her as she spoke then got up as she was speaking still	and simply and wordlessly walked out.	9.67307101415713
4140. and that was the end.	45.3900108286764
4141. he went to the hotel mayflower and telegraphed mencken.	23.619859100028346
4142. would he meet him in baltimore in drawing room a car three	on the train leaving washington at nine o'clock next morning?	10.414561007699776
4143. 	they would go to new york together where parties would be piled on	weariness and on misery.	9.30369265101767
4144. both alfred harcourt and	donald brace had written him enthusiastic praise of elmer gantry	and they had ordered 140000 copies- the largest first	printing of any book in history.	9.09097023028733
4145. but none of this could soothe the	exacerbated nerves.	15.612825124446223
4146. on new year's eve alfred harcourt drove	him up the hudson to bill brown's training camp a well-known establishment	for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who	could no longer help themselves.	9.341215299746557
4147. but in departing lewis begged	breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the grosvenor on	his return and he took with him the first thirty galleys of elmer	gantry.	9.57796032528797
4148. on january 4 with the boys back at school and college	mrs lewis wrote harcourt to say that she was thro quite	thro.	13.86804449202403
4149. this whole washington venture was my last gesture	and it has failed.	12.11828474539159
4150. physically as well as mentally i have reached the	limit of my endurance.	12.560555555905243
4151. my last gift to him is complete silence until	the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down.	9.807549317933542
4152. for him to	divorce god and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity.	14.551538312811703
4153. i am	really ill at the present moment and i will go to some sort of a sanitarium	to normalize myself.	12.831686542584738
4154. and she withdrew then to cromwell	hall in cromwell connecticut.	16.97838423017043
4155. harcourt replied: i do	really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time.	11.429899614263332
4156. of course	i hope hal can also but those hopes are much more faint.	12.822535467615761
4157. on january 8 1927 he returned to the grosvenor in high	spirits and looking fit.	13.673715054166806
4158. he had been he wrote mencken at once in	the country a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly	changed him.	13.726573220326504
4159. charles breasted remembers that before unpacking his bag	he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order and almost at	once the familiar procession of people began milling through our living	room at any hour between two pm and three am.	7.17371635945602
4160. they were strays of every kind- university students and journalists	village hangers-on and barflies taxi drivers and editors and unknown	poets as well as friends like elinor wylie and william rose benet	the van dorens and nathan rebecca west and hugh walpole	and osbert sitwell laurence stallings lewis browne william seabrook	arthur hopkins the woodwards.	8.82956254866483
4161. when he came home from his	office at the end of the afternoon breasted never knew what gathering	he should expect to find but there almost always was one.	12.797820056737104
4162. he did not neglect his wife in cromwell hall but telephoned her and	wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish	to stand behind her in their separation and of his hope that there	would be no bitterness between them.	10.254602519403173
4163. she was occupying herself in	an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they	had rented abroad.	10.935181191255651
4164. he was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go	abroad when the gantry galleys were finished.	15.780454762848995
4165. for a time urging	breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing	instead he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research	for the labor novel; if breasted agreed they would get a car and tour	the country visiting every kind of industrial center.	9.085638722314096
4166. when breasted	insisted that this was impossible for him lewis decided to go abroad.	16.35633145976703
4167. he telephoned l m birkhead and asked him and his	wife to come to europe as his guests but birkhead declined on the	grounds that one of them must be in the united states when elmer	gantry was published.	12.228827878981965
4168. lewis was spending his mornings with the	help of two secretaries on the galleys of that long novel making considerable	revisions and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity	exhausted him once more so that he was compelled to spend three days	in the harbor sanatorium in the last week of january.	9.920366637757287
4169. before he	made that retreat he telephoned earl blackman in kansas city and	asked him to come to europe with him.	10.335043308077761
4170. blackman was to be in new york	by february 2 because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning.	11.967596488592804
4171. lewis told him what clothes he should bring along and enjoined him	not to buy anything that he did not already own they would do that	in new york.	8.34549874809663
4172. blackman arrived a day or two early and lewis took him	to a department store immediately and outfitted him luggage and all	and then he took him to a party at the woodwards that went on until	four in the morning.	9.488127614727723
4173. on the evening that they were to sail	lewis himself gave a party but he was too indisposed to appear at it.	13.43304860436202
4174. woodward took occasion to warn blackman about lewis's drinking	and urged him to try to keep him sober.	11.048737499042803
4175. after a dinner party for	which she had come down to new york mrs lewis and casanova	arrived to see them off and elinor wylie made tart observations that	indicated that lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to	be about the real nature of their separation.	8.380615884381307
4176. nevertheless mrs	lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished	let him sleep with chambermaids if he must but she begged blackman	try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in	good health.	9.013875214859143
4177. as they stood at the first-class rail waving down to his	wife and casanova below lewis said earl there is gracie's	future husband.	10.069941294100943
4178. and when questioned by ship's reporters about	the separation she said i adore him and he adores me.	13.679562978300812
4179. blackman had brought news from kansas city.	11.118618003375188
4180. before his departure	a group of his friends the reverend stidger among them had given	him a luncheon and stidger had seen advance sheets of elmer gantry.	9.468081871813137
4181. he was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered	fifty technical errors in its account of church practices.	11.782910736202219
4182. l m	birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent.	12.531460519553624
4183. but his rancor	did not cease and presently on march 13 when he preached a sermon	on the text and ben-hadad was drunk he told his congregation	how disappointed he was in mr lewis how he regretted having	had him in his house and how he should have been warned by the fact	that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the	book.	9.029509596497187
4184. but that sermon like those of hundreds of other ministers was	yet to be delivered.	16.26321072259099
4185. in london lewis took the usual suite	in bury street.	13.536165535568678
4186. to the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life	about his wish to be a newspaperman once more about the prevalence of	american slang in british speech about the loquacity of the english	and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage about	his plans to wander for two years unless stopped and made to write	another book.	9.461252692861256
4187. the manchester guardian wondered how anyone	in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to mr lewis	since it was well known that mr lewis always did all of the talking.	10.56493846644226
4188. his english friends it said had gone into training to keep	up with him vocally and with his allegro movements around the luncheon	table.	10.048827833018892
4189. the new york times editorialist wondered just who	would stop mr lewis and make him write a book.	11.745310441694443
4190. lewis's	remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce american	reporters to invade the offices of harcourt brace + company for	information to pursue mrs lewis to cromwell hall and after	she had returned to new york to ferret her out at the stanhope on	upper fifth avenue where she had taken an apartment.	8.502437860810861
4191. there to the	evening post she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained	that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son	which henceforth would be strictly american.	9.289870599879068
4192. these rumors of permanent	separation started up a whole crop of stories about her.	11.46224284727585
4193. one had	it that a friend protesting her snobbery said but gracie	you are an american aren't you?	9.785626220226739
4194.  and she replied i was born	in america but i was conceived in vienna.	16.64458973162333
4195. lewis	himself furthered these tales.	14.19641732877796
4196. he is said to have reported that once	when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation	and the friend protested that it had been nothing she replied	well it was your healthy american peasant blood that pulled	you through.	11.374244691694628
4197. with these and similar tales he was entertaining his	english friends all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing	blackman the sights of london and its environs.	10.255164694336491
4198. at once upon	his arrival he telephoned lady sybil colefax who invited them to	tea and then lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding	up his friends.	10.53294274185896
4199. he invited lady sybil lord thomson bechhofer	roberts and a half dozen others.	17.69311795868141
4200. it was a dinner party lewis had	been drinking during the afternoon and long before the party really	got under way he was quite drunk with the result that the party broke	up even before dinner was over.	12.232180789673246
4201. lewis at the head of the table would	leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks	that when not highly offensive were at least highly inappropriate	and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed.	8.39478288124311
4202. when	blackman emerged from the bedroom everyone was gone except the tolerant	lord thomson who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour	and then blackman lay awake most of that night despairing of what he	must expect on the continent.	8.41744586490668
4203. finally at dawn he fell asleep and	when he awoke and came into the living room he found lewis in his pajamas	before the fire smoking a cigarette.	8.604710320782578
4204. blackman said that he wanted	to apologize for not having prevented lewis from making that horrible	spectacle of himself that he should have seized him by the neck	at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom.	9.604560526693534
4205. lewis warned him never	to lay a hand on him and then blackman asked for his fare back	to the united states.	7.811867791937725
4206. lewis looked at him and began to cry and then	saying that he was going to make a promise he asked blackman to call	the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did	not want.	11.49172498642064
4207. and from now on for the rest of this trip i will only	drink what you agree that i should drink.	12.547062057793621
4208. blackman called the porter	and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy and after	that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner or on one of their	walking trips beer or in france and italy wine in moderation.	9.760688770073353
4209. lewis gave him a guidebook tour of london and motoring and	walking took him to stratford but the london stay was for only ten	days and on the twentieth they took the train for southampton where	they spent the night for an early morning channel crossing.	8.042507644444479
4210. near	southampton in a considerable establishment lived homer vachell	a well-known pulp writer and his brother horace- both friends of	lewis's.	9.741854936192937
4211. he suggested that they call on these brothers who received	them pleasantly.	12.858246677984397
4212. then they returned to their hotel and got ready	for bed.	18.220602885072744
4213. it was late and blackman was ready to go to sleep but lewis	was not.	17.40842723816039
4214. he said we had a good time tonight didn't we earl?	23.50856576218139
4215. 	earl agreed and lewis said that it would have been very different	if his wife had been with him.	11.577442967955363
4216. then he kept blackman awake	for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife	and himself in which discussing the evening he was continually berated.	9.90054028406224
4217. he began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does	not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming	and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries.	9.297868161530015
4218. from 1613 on if the lists exist they contain between twenty to thirty	names.	12.15110338147362
4219. as the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was according	to masson two hundred fifty-nine	the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that	year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors	who then incepted.	9.257110487070099
4220. there were four from st john's and	four from christ's three from pembroke and two from each of the	colleges jesus peterhouse queens' and trinity with caius	clare king's magdalene and sidney supplying one each in the ordo	senioritatis.	10.01779950144409
4221. the list was headed by henry hutton of st	john's who was matriculated from st john's at easter	1625.	9.189554574368655
4222. he became a fellow of jesus in 1629 proceeded ma from	jesus in 1632 and was proctor in 1639-40.	11.771904738980838
4223. the second name was edward	kempe matriculated from queens' college at easter 1625.	11.663948123040132
4224. he proceeded ma in 1632 and bd in 1639 being made	fellow in 1632.	13.077823680350345
4225. he was ordained deacon 16 june and priest 22 december	1633.	14.60037810545852
4226. the third name was john ravencroft who was admitted	to the inner temple in november 1631.	12.166919936695
4227. the fourth name was john	milton of christ's college followed by richard manningham	of peterhouse who matriculated 16 october 1624.	9.807415732686207
4228. venn gave his ba	as 1624 a mistake for 1629.	12.242053100592887
4229. manningham also proceeded ma	in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year.	8.450640073948662
4230. john	boutflower of christ's was twelfth in the list coming from perse	school under mr lovering as pensioner 20 april 1625 under mr	alsop.	9.051154372622117
4231. the fourteenth name was richard buckenham written	buckman admitted to christ's college under scott 2 july 1625.	9.403879097775112
4232. the fifteenth name was thomas baldwin admitted to christ's	4 march 1625 under alsop.	12.010194183656237
4233. christ's college was well represented	that year in the ordo and the name highest on the list from that	college was milton's fourth in the entire university.	8.891625664310276
4234. small wonder	that milton later boasted of how well his work had been received	there since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher	than that of any other inceptor from christ's of that year.	9.918496775321133
4235. it is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby	these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they	contained assumed the order in which we find them.	11.571400211038757
4236. the process usually	began with a tutor boasting about a boy as chappell had boasted about	lightfoot to the higher officers of the college and university.	12.633330024958378
4237. then the various officers of the college might take up the case.	16.9521896855434
4238. it	would however reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the	public-school performances of the incepting bachelors and the place	that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported	himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was	incepting.	0.0
4239. of course the higher officials could add or place a name	on the list wherever they wished.	12.094416887537108
4240. milton's name being fourth is neither	too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of	vice-chancellor proctor master or other mighty hand.	9.076086150635952
4241. he evidently	earned the place assigned him.	16.77689410702726
4242. career	looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years	of milton's undergraduate days certain phases of his college	career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us.	9.738898573180805
4243. of	course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of	education he received.	11.844306855000768
4244. it differed from what an undergraduate receives	today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty	of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely	scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates.	10.955928385391655
4245. milton	was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge	of latin grammar logic-rhetoric ethics physics or natural philosophy	metaphysics and latin greek and hebrew.	7.485565382198017
4246. he had also	sampled various special fields of learning being unable to miss some	study of divinity justinian.	12.960300524783225
4247. above all	he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable	degree of artistry.	9.410428132504478
4248. he had learned to dispute devastatingly both formally	and informally in latin and according to the rules on any topic	pro or con drawn from almost any subject more especially from aristotle's	works.	11.324063833590179
4249. he could produce carefully constructed orations	set and formal speeches artfully and prayerfully made by writing and	rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide and then	delivered verbatim from memory.	8.733023385606234
4250. he had also learned to dispute extempore	remarkably well the main evidence for which of course is the presence	of his name in the honors list of 162829.	11.798658959347554
4251. he also displayed	the ability to write latin verse on almost any topic of dispute the	verses of course to be delivered from memory.	10.145550410566155
4252. then we have surviving	at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in naturam non	pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica.	10.755059488120889
4253. but	his greatest achievement in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues	and teachers was his amazing ability to produce literary latin	pieces and he was often called on to do so.	9.55115220622807
4254. these were his public	academic activities domi forisque in the college and in the university.	14.934332603611828
4255. and his performances attracted much attention as the frequency	of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his	undergraduate activities testifies.	10.184752664529942
4256. his other activities are	not so easily recovered.	14.786935048686583
4257. his statements about sports and exercises of	a physical nature are suggestive but inconclusive.	9.58414098581741
4258. his later boastings	of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and	practice devoted to the use of that weapon.	11.772931973535027
4259. venn and others have dealt	with sports and pastimes at cambridge in milton's day with not very	specific results.	8.497103185401873
4260. milton himself uncommunicative as he is about	his lesser and nonliterary activities at least gives us some evidence	that he was a great walker under any and all conditions.	10.73136555023136
4261. his early	poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city	and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its	surrounding countryside.	10.17563433236487
4262. the town itself and the reedy cam he	often visited as did all in the university.	12.683071981196427
4263. the churches the taverns	and the various other places of the town must have known his figure	well as he roved to and about them.	9.576240180821175
4264. the tiny hamlet of chesterton	to the north with the fens and marshes lying on down the ouse river	may have attracted him often as it did many other youths of the time.	9.570440374667083
4265. the gog magog hills to the southeast afforded him and all other	students a vantage point from which to view the town and university	of their dwelling.	9.410562276478574
4266. the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly	spectacular in its scenery though it offers easy going to the	foot traveler.	11.215753538168137
4267. ball games especially football required some attention	and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant	or spectator.	8.1523940120599
4268. he smoked as did everybody and imbibed the various alcoholic	beverages of that day although his protestations while at cambridge	and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence	from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and we	must add of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers.	10.930871866935016
4269. what manner of person does milton appear to have been	when as an undergraduate he resided at christ's college?	9.222801635048148
4270.  he was	then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance medium stature	and handsome face.	12.264873606853545
4271. graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had	taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight wiry	frame he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college	to which he himself referred in prolusion 6: a quibusdam	audivi nuper domina.	8.512704356150492
4272. that is if we can trust that most specious	of prolusions packed as it is with wit and persiflage.	14.551248403106495
4273. the domina	sounds real enough if we could only trust the conditions under	which we learn of its use; but anyone who would put much trust in any	phase of prolusion 6 except its illusive allusiveness deserves	whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously	stilted banter.	7.524675673206539
4274. in short the traditional epithet for milton of 'lady	of christ's' while eminently fitting rests only on this	baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing	milton left us.	12.053111561091846
4275. aubrey's mention of it	comes from this prolusion through christopher	milton or edward phillips.	9.070074471681158
4276. it is not a question of truth or falsity;	the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the	epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that	almost nothing in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false.	12.00321321157416
4277. the entire exercise latin and english is most suggestive of the	kind of person milton had become at christ's during his undergraduate	career; the mere fact that he was selected though as a substitute	to act as interlocutor or moderator for it or perhaps we should say	with buck as 'father of the act' is in itself a difficult phase	of his development to grasp.	7.742674597844502
4278. milton was to act as the archfool the	supreme wit the lightly bantering pater pater liber who could	at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could	at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering and	with words alone.	8.81749395418665
4279. from an exercise involving merely raucous rough-and-tumble	comedy in his hands the performance turned into a revel of	wit and word play indecent at times but always learned pointed and	carefully aimed at some individuals present and at the whole assembly.	0.0
4280. to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent	for both solemn and ribald raillery a talent not bestowed on many persons	but one with which milton was marked as being endowed and in which	at least in this performance he obviously reveled.	9.022284163528669
4281. it may be thought	unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform	if again we may trust the opening of the oratio for it marks	the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play	that even in this latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of	viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an	adversary.	9.005452606013742
4282. but the real beginnings of this development in him go back	to the opposing of grammar school and probably if it had not been this	occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others such	as the first prolusion that set off this streak in him of unbridled	and scathing verbal attack on an enemy.	9.979554325893428
4283. all western europe would hear	and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century.	13.713769361095066
4284. but these prolusions that we have surviving from the christ's	college days are only one phase of his existence then.	13.008376455137176
4285. perhaps	his most important private activity was the combination of reading	discussion with a few- if we can trust his writings to diodati and	the younger gill very few- congenial companions.	7.703481287362913
4286. lines 23-36 of lycidas	later point to a friendship with edward king who entered	christ's college 9 june 1626.	10.155523705846772
4287. no other names among the young men	in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton	as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted.	11.641034548838762
4288. but that scarcely	means that he was the aloof forbidding type of student who shared	few if any activities with his fellows the banter of the surviving	prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this.	11.237164033882292
4289. apparently he was	not a participant in the college or university theatricals which he	once attacked as utterly unworthy performances;	but even in that famous passage milton was aiming not at the	theatricals as such but at their performance by 'persons either enter'd	or presently to enter into the ministry'.	7.838650653925275
4290. the fact that he	nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of	the boys later in his hypothetical academy should not be taken	too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances.	13.894819599462894
4291. perhaps in that short piece or letter written to hartlib in	which he sketched his scheme for educating young men he merely overlooked	that phase of their exercises.	8.00149197566106
4292. writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions	that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe	and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot.	9.92541511814346
4293. on	the other hand the bright vision of the future has been directly stated	in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies- science	fiction of course is related if sometimes distantly to that	utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period	of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries	produced edward bellamy's looking backward and h g	wells's a modern utopia.	8.624908948689587
4294. in arthur clarke's childhood's	end though written after the present flood of dystopias	began we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly	defined.	10.780018885191554
4295. childhood's end- apparently indebted to kurd	lasswitz's utopian romance auf zwei planeten and	also to wells's histories of the future especially the world set	free-	describes	the bloodless conquest of earth by the overlords vastly superior	creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for	its next stage of development an eventual merging with the composite	mind of the universe.	7.595956060174552
4296. arriving just in time to stop men from turning	their planet into a radioactive wasteland the overlords unite earth	into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and	ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist.	9.1736501596902
4297. under their rule	earth becomes a technological utopia.	14.399349543287476
4298. both abolition of war and new	techniques of production particularly robot factories greatly increase	the world's wealth a situation described in the following passage	which has the true utopian ring: everything was so cheap that	the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by	the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once	been.	8.480235496710065
4299. a man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever he fancied-	without handing over any money.	10.83942559178895
4300. with destructive tensions and	pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human	life- rebuilding entire cities expanding facilities for entertainment	providing unlimited opportunities for education- indeed for	the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the	fullest.	9.10781567989403
4301. mankind as a result attains previously undreamed of levels	of civilization and culture a golden age which the overlords a very	evident symbol of science have helped produce by introducing reason	and the scientific method into human activities.	7.619672845081025
4302. thus science is the	savior of mankind and in this respect childhood's end only	blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which though not	always so directly stated	has nevertheless been present in the minds	of most science-fiction writers.	11.349732385958673
4303. considering then the optimism	which has permeated science fiction for so long what is really remarkable	is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers	have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future	have attacked the childhood's end kind of faith that science	and technology will inevitably better the human condition.	7.296067765370827
4304. and they	have done this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novels	and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure	with dystopian elements.	9.521843308922909
4305. because of the means of publication- science-fiction	magazines and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science	fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent	of this phenomenon can hardly be known though one fact is evident:	the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations.	8.518920254330984
4306. among the dystopias for example isaac asimov's the	caves of steel portrays the deadly effects on human life	of the super-city of the future; james blish's a case of conscience	describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction	in underground shelters; ray bradbury's fahrenheit	451 presents a book-burning society in which wall television	and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; walter m miller	jr's a canticle for leibowitz finds men after	the great atomic disaster stumbling back to their previous level of	civilization and another catastrophe; frederick pohl's the midas	touch predicts an economy of abundance which in order	to remain prosperous must set its robots to consuming surplus production;	clifford d simak's how-2 tells of a future	when robots have taken over leaving men nothing to do; and robert	sheckley's the status civilization describes a world	which frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it	becomes static and conformist.	7.771500581148715
4307. a more complete list would also include	bradbury's the pedestrian philip k	dick's	solar lottery wilson	tucker's the long loud silence jack vance's	to live forever	gore vidal's messiah and	bernard wolfe's limbo as well as the three perhaps most	outstanding dystopias frederik pohl and c m kornbluth's	the space merchants kurt vonnegut's player	piano works which	we will later examine in detail.	7.579095127183179
4308. the novels and stories like pohl's	drunkard's walk with the focus on adventure and	with the dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case an	uneasy overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting	routine jobs while a carefully selected university-trained elite	runs everything- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias.	9.088386563916728
4309. there is of course nothing new about dystopias for they belong	to a literary tradition which including also the closely related satiric	utopias stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century	and swift's gulliver's travels to the twentieth century	and zamiatin's we capek's war with the newts huxley's	brave new world e m forster's the machine	stops c s lewis's that hideous strength	and orwell's nineteen eighty-four and which in science fiction	is represented	before the present deluge as early as wells's trilogy the	time machine a story of the days to come and when	the sleeper wakes and as recently as jack williamson's with	folded hands the classic story of men replaced by their	own robots.	7.6834673523436665
4310. what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so	many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing	works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life.	10.846915151513423
4311. since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the	last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief	impetus was the 1949 publication of nineteen eighty-four an assumption	which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as	room 101 along with education by conditioning from brave new world	a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned	with new interest after reading the more powerful orwell dystopia.	7.23171768129194
4312. not all recent science fiction however is dystopian for the	optimistic strain is still very much alive in mission of gravity	and childhood's end as we have seen as well as in many other	recent popular novels and stories like fred hoyle's the black	cloud; and among works of dystopian science fiction not	all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature-	but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction.	9.072734508575094
4313. in addition there are many areas of the human situation besides	the impact of science and technology which are examined for science-fiction	dystopias often extrapolate political social economic tendencies	only indirectly related to science and technology.	11.068961412219918
4314. nevertheless	with all these qualifications and exceptions the current dystopian	phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology	instead of bringing utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even	destroy men.	8.500891348827954
4315. how effectively these warnings can be presented is seen	in pohl and kornbluth's the space merchants vonnegut's	player piano and wyndham's re-birth.	8.691975037381527
4316. easily	the best known of these three novels is the space merchants a	good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more	than the impact of science on human life though its most important	warning is in this area namely as to the use to which discoveries in	the behavioral sciences may be put.	9.731440272761208
4317. the novel which is not merely dystopian	but also brilliantly satiric describes a future america where	one-sixteenth of the population the men who run advertising agencies	and big corporations control the rest of the people the submerged	fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers with the government	being no more than a clearing house for pressures.	9.846130640368965
4318. like	ours the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order	to survive and like ours it is based on the principle of ever	increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption.	10.920650790000916
4319. the consequences of course have been dreadful: reckless expansion	has led to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion	of its natural resources.	13.08139993189988
4320. for example even the most successful executive	lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in	the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night; soyaburgers	have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is	saved for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled that	no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs.	9.197410513753036
4321. while the space merchants indicates as kingsley amis has	correctly observed some of the impending consequences of the growth	of industrial and commercial power and satirizes existing habits	in the advertising profession its warning and analysis penetrate	much deeper.	8.14529147844503
4322. what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is	an outrage an assault on people's mental privacy or that it	is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains	a coercive tendency.	10.659456086935098
4323. rather what kornbluth	and pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent	in perfecting a science of man and his motives.	8.896512249776745
4324. the space	merchants like such humanist documents as joseph wood krutch's	the measure of man and c s lewis's the abolition	of man considers what may result from the scientific study	of human nature.	9.530147145584797
4325. if man is actually the product of his environment	and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which	environment determines what people do then someone- a someone	probably standing outside traditional systems of values- can turn around	and develop completely efficient means for controlling people.	8.556034785153425
4326. thus	we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners	and the controlled.	11.426312343554466
4327. and this of course is exactly what madison avenue	has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way with its hidden	persuaders and what the space merchants accomplish with much	greater sophistication and precision.	9.673065473553363
4328. pohl and kornbluth's	ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques	of advertising which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis	in american life which work on the libido of consumers which	are linked to the great prime motivations of the human spirit.	9.126489712888045
4329. as the hero mitchell courtenay explains before his conversion	the job of advertising is to convince people without letting them	know that they're being convinced.	9.281338461049842
4330. and to do this requires first	of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the	scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research who for	example tell courtenay that three days is the optimum priming period	for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase-	which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send	an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine	it.	9.387037319503479
4331. and the second requirement for convincing people without	their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which	persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered.	10.137433928605414
4332. thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the	person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet the person capable	of putting together words that stir and move and sing.	12.300875771228197
4333. as	courtenay explains here in this profession we reach into the souls	of men and women.	9.08543694655472
4334. and we do it by taking talent- and redirecting	it.	14.80304085885042
4335. now the basic question to be asked in this situation	is what motivates the manipulators that is what are their values?	9.662067708800722
4336. -	since as courtenay says nobody should play with lives the way	we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals.	9.542342096710604
4337. but the only	ideal he can think of is sales! indeed again and again the	space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners	and behavioral scientists once they have seen through human	nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide	them.	8.704645835827444
4338. we often say of a person that he looks young for his age	or old for his age.	11.243345137160563
4339. yet even in the more extreme of such cases	we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is.	10.858876335981902
4340. and	this means i suppose that almost invariably age reveals itself by	easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind.	10.38233400275636
4341. young	for his age means only the presence of some minor characteristic	not quite usual.	9.825925385832923
4342. stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless	there.	15.2510825444104
4343. an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful	characteristics deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed	hair.	10.256580797899401
4344. looking young for your age means for your age and	it means no more.	11.241950212420955
4345. a mind expressing itself in words may reveal	itself a little less obviously as old or young.	9.18758731710668
4346. its surface loses its	bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious	than the body does.	10.087944814784771
4347. youth may be and often is skeptical cynical or	despairing; age may be idealistic believing and much given to professions	of optimism.	8.061926496716687
4348. but there is nevertheless always a subtle difference	in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held.	21.18968073054824
4349. the	pessimism of the young is defiant anxious to confess or even exaggerate	its ostensible gloom and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that	it regards	its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate	for the awfulness of that truth.	7.301251970003769
4350. similarly the optimism of age	protests too much.	15.018582296636083
4351. if it proclaims that the best is yet to be it always	arouses at least in the young either a suspicious question or perhaps	the exclamation of the negro youth who saw on a tombstone the	inscription i am not dead but sleeping.	10.363104046023103
4352. boy you ain't fooling	nobody but yourself.	13.915190642667962
4353. we may say of some unfortunates	that they were never young.	14.041944916013737
4354. we cannot truthfully say of anyone who has	succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old.	13.077122234727089
4355. those famous lines of the greek anthology with which a fading beauty	dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude:	venus take my votive glass since i am not what i was what	from this day i shall be venus let me never see.	7.90969225271021
4356. no	good can come of contemplating the sad inevitable fact that once youth	has passed a worse and worse time still succeeds the former.	8.951887347307554
4357. but there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind	in even a cracked mirror.	19.581891959552657
4358. one is that there sometimes are real although	inadequate compensations in growing old.	22.307288830270377
4359. serenity if one is fortunate	enough to achieve it is not so good as joy but it is something.	12.725790815694944
4360. even to be from hope and fear set free is at least better than	to have lost the first without having got rid of the second.	10.684957733250359
4361. the other	reason is that one thus	becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion or change of opinion	whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of	the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all	too obvious physical differences.	7.535087318051611
4362. one may be exasperatingly aware	that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of	one's own age.	13.163350641377898
4363. but at least the question has been raised.	25.624724881013694
4364. many readers	of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for	the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they	have never actually been told what my age is.	9.88116882943967
4365. at least i should like	them to know that i know these discounts are being made.	16.212337180655407
4366. let	me then glance into the mirror.	13.915190642667962
4367. i have known some	men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember	seem utter strangers to them now; that their remote past is as	discontinuous with their present selves as lacking in any conscious	likeness to their mature personality as the self of a butterfly may be	imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was.	8.145791729814238
4368. for	my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs.	13.882131813411485
4369. i	have changed and i have reversed opinions; but i am so aware of an	uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that i see only as absurd	the tendency of some psychologists from heraclitus to pirandello	and proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which	nothing remains unchanged.	7.939041471931091
4370. so far as i am concerned the child is	unmistakably father to the man despite the obvious fact that child and	father differ greatly- sometimes for the better and sometimes for	the worse.	14.307740893839293
4371. fundamental values temperament and the way in which	one approaches a conviction change less of course than specific opinions.	10.587668363389115
4372. that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many	present-day intellectuals who were communists or near-communists in	their youth and are now so extremely conservative	that they can define no important political conviction	that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make	the distinction between mr nixon and mr khrushchev for them	hardly worth noting.	10.580394825908469
4373. but in ways more fundamental than specific political	opinions they are still what they always were: passionate sure	without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of capable	of seeing black and white only and therefore committed to the	logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to.	9.419816466274247
4374. to those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally or	politically or sociologically antiquated	i would like to say what i have already	hinted namely that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some	discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore	incapable of being youthful of mind.	10.103951153586685
4375. but i will also remind them that	i have always been inclined to skepticism to a kind of laodicean	lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned; so that	although not as eager as i once was to be disapproved of i can still	resist prevailing opinions.	9.227591928357315
4376. at about the age of twelve i became	a spencerian liberal and i have always considered myself a liberal	of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since	spencer became a reactionary.	11.489265501804477
4377. several times in my youth i voted	the socialist ticket but less because i was socialist than because	i was not either a republican or a democrat and i voted for	franklin roosevelt every time he was a candidate.	7.961608480496621
4378. yet during the years	when i was on the staff of the nation i tried to the limit	the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted	to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social	question.	11.245599190403874
4379. never once during the trying thirties did i come so	close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant russian	communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums an interesting	experiment.	8.038052513777581
4380. there are few things of which i am prouder than	of that unblemished record.	20.024749492288088
4381. many of my friends at the time thought that	i had received a well-deserved condemnation when lincoln steffens	denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of	the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead	past.	10.761209311280231
4382. but he as i can now retort was the man who could see so	short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he gave voice to	the famous exclamation: i have seen the future and it works.	12.396473317177895
4383. the favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval	of communism is that they did not know how things would develop.	14.789556699087386
4384. with	this excuse i have never been much impressed.	15.36602801815194
4385. there was it seems	to me enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of russian	leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait	to see how it would turn out.	9.78916606801783
4386. once many years ago i sat at dinner	next to arthur train and the subject of the nation came	up.	14.472148948482037
4387. he asked me suddenly what are your political opinions?	15.208700642031557
4388. 	well i replied some of my colleagues on the paper regard	me as a rank reactionary.	10.283019658107557
4389. after a moment's thought he replied	that still leaves you a lot of latitude.	12.909553910130938
4390. and i suppose it	did.	32.34358644478796
4391. i never have been and am not now any kind of utopian.	14.352930528555596
4392. when	i first came across samuel johnson's pronouncement the remedy	for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical it seemed	to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths.	9.402219720457273
4393. it	will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any	other phrase or principle could.	8.843349185367748
4394. why did i choose to fill these	pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous	reflections and autobiography?	12.496252481507113
4395.  the reason is i think my awareness	that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm	the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets	us nowhere and that i am simply too old to hope.	8.157488138893575
4396. i would however	like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see	dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever	since i can remember and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon.	13.752121740285746
4397. i know that one must act.	27.922428127713886
4398. but one need not always be sure that the	action is either wise or conclusive.	16.105770153800822
4399. apropos of what some would	call cynicism i remember an anecdote the source of which i forget.	9.988023760780967
4400. it concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object	lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside	his church door.	11.556442068470165
4401. not only his parishioners but the whole town and	ultimately the whole county were enormously impressed by this object	lesson.	10.61752003234731
4402. one day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators	who wanted to know his secret.	12.756097498034736
4403. how on earth do you manage it?	14.03484833731173
4404. 	what is the trick?	16.6462465444584
4405.  why he replied it is perfectly simple;	there is no trick involved.	12.14567055979233
4406. all you have to do is put in a fresh	lamb from time to time.	24.004282663984483
4407. cynical?	24.303019953065355
4408.  blasphemous?	28.49691246350829
4409.  not really	it seems to me.	17.39457049182423
4410. the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down	together was given in the future tense.	15.749952296561602
4411. it is not something that can	be expected to happen now.	21.14455278174095
4412. without really changing the general	subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by	doubts not only about pacifism but also when asked to join in the protest	against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane	and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous; namely the law	that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no	extenuating circumstances.	9.435732474570324
4413. it is not that i am unaware of the force	of their strongest contention.	19.767342342850913
4414. life they say should be regarded as	sacred and therefore as something that neither an individual nor his	society has a right to take away.	11.434664907066685
4415. in fact i cannot imagine myself	condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if i had to take	as an individual the responsibility for his death.	11.38564438573453
4416. just as i know	i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot sincerely call myself	a pacifist so too i would not be either a hangman by profession or	if i could avoid it even a member of a hanging jury.	10.632602496038844
4417. despite these	facts the question should no murderer ever be executed?	11.163559865624109
4418.  seems	to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a	simple negative answer.	11.698163460271266
4419. punishment of the wrongdoer so liberals	are inclined to say can have only three possible justifications:	revenge reformation or deterrent example.	7.9139724503302755
4420. for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to	counterbalance existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to	the tarnished image of the species man or as malraux himself puts	it to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves.	9.786543407835802
4421. andre malraux's the walnut trees of altenburg	was written in the early years of the second world war during	a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the germans	after the fall of france.	11.928682334592573
4422. the manuscript presumably after being	smuggled out of the country was published in switzerland in 1943.	15.515306237612437
4423. the work as it stands is not the entire book that malraux wrote at that	time- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called	la lutte avec l'ange; and this first section was somehow preserved	when the gestapo destroyed the rest.	8.492823545817355
4424. if we are to believe the list of titles printed in malraux's latest	book la metamorphose des dieux vol 1 he is	still	engaged in writing a large novel under his original title.	12.720704468935569
4425. but as he	remarks in his preface to the walnut trees a novel can hardly	ever be rewritten and when this one appears in its final form	the form of the first part h will no doubt be radically changed.	9.183084880535528
4426. malraux pretends perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty	that his fragmentary work will accordingly appeal only to the	curiosity of bibliophiles	and to connoisseurs of what might have	been.	8.562540869981424
4427. even in its present form however the first part of malraux's	unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth	century literature; and it should be far better known than it is.	9.612284176150299
4428. the theme of the walnut trees of altenburg is most closely	related to its immediate predecessor in malraux's array of novels:	man's hope.	10.825445196439658
4429. this magnificent but greatly underestimated	book which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time	as no other comparable creation has suffered severely from having	been written about an historical event- the spanish civil war-	that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political	feuds.	7.1071608711668794
4430. even so apparently impartial a critic as w h frohock	has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece	of loyalist propaganda; and has then gone on to argue with unimpeachable	consistency that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects	of the book are simply inadvertent contradictions.	9.288914983506926
4431. nothing	however could be farther from the truth.	11.118618003375188
4432. the whole purpose of	man's hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and	ends inherent in all organized political violence- and even when such	violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty justice	and human dignity.	9.384953132920248
4433. nowhere before in malraux's pages have we	met such impassioned defenders of a quality of man which transcends	the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether-	both the action of malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like perken	and garine and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated communists	like kyo gisors and katow in man's fate.	7.468246132261548
4434. man engages	only a small part of himself in an action says old alvear the art-historian;	and the more the action claims to be total the smaller	is the part of man engaged.	10.798116879688424
4435. these lines never cease to haunt	the book amidst all the exaltations of combat and to make an appeal for	a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal	necessities of war.	9.003503006795682
4436. it is this larger theme of the quality	of man a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into	the human which now forms the pulsating heart of malraux's	artistic universe.	11.74782646541345
4437. malraux to be sure does not abandon the world	of violence combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as	a creative artist and which is the only world apparently in which	his imagination can flame into life.	8.615377684021702
4438. the walnut trees of altenburg	includes not one war but two and throws in a turkish revolution	along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure.	9.705138323588429
4439. but	while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that malraux wishes	to express these values are no longer linked with the triumph or	defeat of any cause- whether that of an individual assertion of the	will-to-power or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation	of oppression- as their necessary condition.	7.376671605011126
4440. on the contrary the	frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the	sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance	of a caravaggio.	11.526144736099107
4441. the walnut trees of altenburg	is composed in the form of a triptych with the two small side panels	framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel.	9.944067976781266
4442. this	central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period	from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war.	0.0
4443. the framing scenes on the other hand both take place in the late	spring of 1940 just at the moment of the defeat of france in the	second great world conflict.	12.531210432979195
4444. the narrator is an alsatian serving with	the french army and he has the same name that malraux	himself was later to use in the resistance; like malraux he was also	serving in the tank corps before being captured and we learn as well	that in civilian life he had been a writer.	9.648105420117751
4445. these biographical analogies	are obvious and far too much time has been spent speculating	on their possible implications.	9.16648452424694
4446. much more important is to grasp	the feelings of the narrator as he	becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of french prisoners	clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral	of chartres.	10.542214766151337
4447. for as his companions gradually dissolve back	into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity as they	lose all the appanage of their acquired culture he is overcome by	the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind.	8.656872346134364
4448. as a writer by what have i been obsessed these last ten	years if not by mankind?	13.006104834854924
4449.  here i am face to face with the primeval	stuff.	18.12261094804815
4450. the intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening	pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of	the text; and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been	done.	9.286166243761201
4451. what does the narrator see and what does he feel?	16.88199809502988
4452.  a good many	pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged	determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families-	even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing	the letters to blow away in the wind.	10.313012552919771
4453. awkwardly and laboriously in stiff	unemotional phrases the soldiers continue to bridge the distance	between themselves and those they love; they instinctively struggle	to keep open a road to the future in their hearts.	8.023709659302682
4454. and by a skillful	and unobtrusive use of imagery	stockade the hastily erected lean-to is a babylonian hovel	the men begin to look like peruvian mummies and to acquire	malraux projects a fresco of human endurance-	which is also the endurance of the human- stretching backward into	the dark abyss of time.	9.108470040978181
4455. the narrator feels himself catching a glimpse	of pre-history learning of man's age-old familiarity with misfortune	as well as his equally age-old ingenuity his secret	faith in endurance however crammed with catastrophes the same faith	perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine.	8.271751407206567
4456. this new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied	by a re-vision of his previous view.	12.17740054928541
4457. i thought i knew more than	my education had taught me notes the narrator because i had encountered	the militant mobs of a political or religious faith.	9.005631386464623
4458. is	this not malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with	the ideological?	11.42639788168666
4459.  but now he knows that an intellectual is not only	a man to whom books are necessary he is any man whose reasoning	however elementary it may be affects and directs his life.	9.679221597694397
4460. from this	point of view the militant mobs of the past stirred into action	by one ideology or another were all composed of intellectuals-	and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be	discovered.	11.381633395190168
4461. the men around him observes the narrator have been	living from day to day for thousands of years.	11.698086624249143
4462. the human is deeper	than a mass ideology certainly deeper than the isolated individual;	and the narrator recalls the words of his father vincent berger:	it is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one	finally comes down to mankind.	9.434426957122678
4463. the entire middle section	of the walnut trees is taken up with the life of vincent berger	himself whose fragmentary notes on his encounters with mankind	are now conveyed by his son.	9.37526036583814
4464. he was not much older than myself	writes the narrator when he began to feel the impact of that human	mystery which now obsesses me and which makes me begin perhaps	to understand him.	11.616859184604557
4465. for the figure of vincent berger malraux has	obviously drawn on his studies of t e lawrence	and like	both lawrence and malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of nietzsche.	9.630263989586307
4466. a professor at the university of constantinople where his first	course of lectures was on nietzsche and the philosophy of action	vincent berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the	german embassy in turkey.	11.480461177903948
4467. as an alsatian before the first world	war he was of course of german nationality; but he quickly involves	himself in the young turk revolutionary movement to such an extent	that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism.	9.597972325922825
4468. and after becoming	the right-hand man of enver pasha he is sent by the latter	to pave the way for a new turkish empire embracing the union of all	turks throughout central asia from adrianople to the chinese oases	on the silk trade route.	10.212292604536225
4469. vincent berger's mission	is a failure because the ottoman nationalism on which enver pasha	counted does not exist.	8.658408713020384
4470. central asia is sunk in a somnolence from which	nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing	human any longer seemed to survive vincent berger begins to dream	of the occident.	8.530191968119912
4471. oh for the green of europe! trains whistling	in the night the rattle and clatter of cabs h.	8.762420424485509
4472. finally after	almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could not fight back	because madmen are sacred to islam- he throws up his mission and	returns to europe.	9.668214104242656
4473. this has been his first encounter with mankind and	although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular european	press it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied.	10.190914858030784
4474. despite berger's	report enver pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a turkish blood	alliance; and vincent berger learns that political ambition	is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men.	9.04974475878487
4475. but as he discovers	shortly on returning among intellectuals obsessed by le culte	du moi his experience of action had also taught him a more positive	lesson.	10.400151855111043
4476. for six years my father had had to do too much commanding	and convincing writes the narrator not to understand that man	begins with 'the other'.	12.321780023320656
4477. and when vincent berger returns	to europe this first result of his encounters with mankind is	considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation.	10.262150906771984
4478. for a dawning	sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which	as so often in malraux suddenly confront a character with the existential	question of the nature and value of human life.	11.560447356135262
4479. one such event	is the landing in europe itself when the mingled familiarity and strangeness	of the occident after the blank immensities of asia shocks	the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities	of human life.	8.638654358570756
4480. in a pessimistic assessment of the cold war eden declared: there	must be much closer unity within the west before there can be effective	negotiation with the east.	12.601163233958905
4481. ordinary methods of diplomacy within	the free world are inadequate said the former prime minister.	9.150082279324023
4482. something much more thorough is required.	16.01998227660059
4483. citing the experience	of the combined chiefs of staff in world war 2 eden said	that all would have been confusion and disarray without them.	9.070723537833764
4484. this	he said is exactly what has been happening between the politically	free nations in the postwar world.	10.970395643044752
4485. we need joint chiefs of a political	general staff.	17.753738212107354
4486. citing the advances of communist power in	recent years sir anthony observed: this very grave state of	affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality	of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources	to meet it.	8.467913664680074
4487. while i fully agree with sir anthony's	contention i think that we must carry the analysis farther bearing	in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our need	the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the	measure of our capacity.	8.799277327571389
4488. while it is hazardous to project	the trend of history it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully	emerging in the western world particularly among the countries	of western europe.	0.0
4489. at the end of world war 2 free europe was	ready for a new beginning.	26.165436329261507
4490. the excesses of nationalism had brought	down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the	old order of things seemed unthinkable.	9.982918374368829
4491. under these conditions a new	generation of europeans began to discover the bonds of long association	and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist	xenophobia.	8.67574502421163
4492. a slow and painful trend toward unification has taken	hold a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which	may also lead to a binding federation of europe.	9.910273625775298
4493. it may well be	that the unification of europe will prove inadequate that the survival	of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of	the entire western world.	10.757321466130646
4494. the movement toward european unity	has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism	one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe the	other building on wartime precedents of practical coo^peration for the	solution of specific problems.	10.341184345346482
4495. thus far the advances made have been	almost entirely along functional lines.	10.738206050654526
4496. many factors contributed	to the growth of the european movement.	19.68347193783891
4497. in 1946 sir winston churchill	who had spoken often of european union during the war advocated	the formation of a kind of united states of europe.	12.81173899116541
4498. had	churchill been returned to office in 1945 it is just possible that	britain instead of standing fearfully aloof would have led europe	toward union.	9.981574737176505
4499. in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive	coo^rdinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation	of the organization for european economic coo^peration to supervise	and coo^rdinate the uses of american aid under the marshall	plan.	8.855248069116033
4500. the united states might well have exploited the opportunity	provided by the european recovery program to push the hesitant european	nations toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration	but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united	states government at the time.	10.563140999175943
4501. another powerful factor in	the european movement was the threat of soviet aggression.	10.878134642440047
4502. the communist	coup in czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the	conclusion of the brussels treaty a 50-year alliance among britain	france and the benelux countries.	9.602164633469624
4503. and of course the soviet threat	was responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic	nations.	12.011933359656185
4504. new organs of unification proliferated in the decade	following the conclusion of the nato alliance.	13.337824161763438
4505. in 1949 the council	of europe came into existence a purely consultative parliamentary	body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity.	9.792272900168927
4506. in 1952 the european coal and steel community was launched	placing the coal and steel production of france west germany italy	and benelux under a supranational high authority.	10.235254503468603
4507. for a time it	appeared that a common european army might be created but the project	for a european defense community was rejected by the french national	assembly in 1954.	9.507162000688874
4508. in 1957 the social-economic approach to european	integration was capped by the formation among the six of	a tariff-free european common market and euratom for coo^peration	in the development of atomic energy.	10.825354620744724
4509. the overseas democracies	have generally encouraged the european unification movement	without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation	in a broader atlantic community.	9.608716860346647
4510. the united states and canada	belong only to nato and the new oecd.	20.64484651692903
4511. britain	until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of	the groom at a shotgun wedding.	10.019714232458949
4512. in other areas it held back pleading	its commonwealth bonds.	22.531768853754603
4513. now britain has decided to seek admission	to the european economic community and it seems certain that she will	be joined by some of her partners in the loose free trade area	of the outer seven.	8.096688733003784
4514. besides its historical significance as a	break with the centuries-old tradition of british insularity britain's	move if successful will constitute an historic landmark of the	first importance in the movement toward the unification of europe and	the western world.	8.463148397111029
4515. if a broader atlantic community is to	be formed- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both	our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand	in the nato alliance.	9.49113182819565
4516. the time is now ripe indeed overdue	for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities for	its development as an instrument of atlantic community.	11.396296914973544
4517. what is required	is the full implementation of article 2 of the treaty which	provides: the parties will contribute toward the further development	of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening	their free institutions by bringing about a better understanding of	the principles upon which these institutions are founded and by promoting	conditions of stability and well-being.	7.6704890340288765
4518. they will seek to eliminate	conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage	economic collaboration between any and all of them.	13.997215273956382
4519. as lester	pearson wrote in 1955: nato cannot live on fear alone.	11.83592265257558
4520. it	cannot become the source of a real atlantic community if it remains	organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought	it into being.	11.358396257256612
4521. the problem of nato is not one of machinery	of which there is an abundance but of the will to use it.	17.722626018413155
4522. the	nato council is available as an executive agency the standing	group as a high military authority.	9.908939338115298
4523. the unofficial conference of	parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority.	11.195564017417244
4524. this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community	by fiat but only when that community evolves from potentiality to	reality.	10.137731403116172
4525. the existence of a community is a state of mind- a conviction	that goals and values are widely shared that effective communication	is possible that mutual trust is reasonably assured.	9.222140627457584
4526. an	equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the	development and expansion of the oecd conceived as	an organ of economic coo^peration there is no reason why oecd	cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members	so desire.	10.346907120807563
4527. indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato	for the development of a parliamentary organ of the atlantic	nations because it could encompass all of the members of the atlantic	community including those like sweden and switzerland who	are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like	nato.	10.025888265220022
4528. underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a	conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form	a community at least a potential community.	13.385687865490631
4529. there is nothing new	in this; what is new and compelling is that the west is now but one	of several powerful civilizations or systems and that one or	more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the west.	10.122600889324495
4530. for centuries	the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they	did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other.	15.211669466162604
4531. that time	is now past and the atlantic nations if they are to survive must develop	a full-fledged community and they must also look beyond the frontiers	of western civilization toward a world-wide concert of	free nations.	8.259188387544361
4532. the burden of these reflections is that	a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs.	16.035638270526466
4533. and if we do not aspire to too much it is also within our capacity.	16.436944131293014
4534. a realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization	on the one hand and our capacity to achieve them on the other	must be approached through the concept of community.	12.854914463333467
4535. history	has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on	the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external	danger ceases to be dramatically urgent.	7.4703314814554895
4536. only when a concert of	nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values	is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy.	10.95282148882016
4537. it follows	that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is	only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation	and coo^rdination.	11.27541883292212
4538. it is very much a matter of building	the foundations of community.	30.05776520649642
4539. it is for these reasons that proposals	for a new world order through radical overhaul of the united	nations or through some sort of world federation are utterly	fatuous.	12.524869280114201
4540. in a recent book called world peace through world law	two distinguished lawyers grenville clark and louis sohn call	for just such an overhaul of the un basing their case on	the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust.	9.961124354768431
4541. i believe that these proposals	however meritorious in terms of world needs go far beyond our	capacity to realize them.	13.048814299513715
4542. such proposals look to an apocalyptic act	a kind of lockian social contract on a world-wide scale.	10.15830770028601
4543. the	defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their	assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible.	8.426399758711819
4544. a working concept of the organic evolution of community	must lead us in a different direction.	14.154687615300103
4545. the failures of the un	and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond	what was internationally feasible.	10.327562795988076
4546. our problem therefore is to	devise processes more modest in their aspirations adjusted to the real	world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities.	9.464003477887795
4547. the history of the un demonstrates that in a pluralistic	world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than	coercion.	11.6243819061873
4548. it is possible that international organization will ultimately	supplant the multi-state system but its proper function for the	immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to	render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world.	11.566324553226234
4549. new machinery of coo^rdination should not be our primary objective	in	the foreseeable future- though perhaps the political general staff	of western leaders proposed by sir anthony eden would serve	a useful purpose.	7.96390165282614
4550. generally however there is an abundance of available	machinery of coo^rdination- in nato in oecd	in the un and elsewhere.	14.026269905923993
4551. the trouble with this machinery	is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence	of a conscious sense of community among the free nations.	12.942845422987766
4552. our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the	realization of a potential community.	13.613379799269849
4553. a concert of free nations	should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century	concert of europe with its common values and accepted rules	of the game.	9.917684429526215
4554. constitutions of and by themselves mean little; the	history of both the league of nations and the united nations demonstrates	that.	13.797658418043445
4555. but a powerful sense of community even with little	or no machinery means a great deal.	12.47219700645806
4556. that is the lesson of the nineteenth	century.	26.112601078703022
4557. a realistic concert of free nations might	be expected to consist of an inner community of the north atlantic	nations and an outer community embracing much or all of the	non-communist world.	8.503272346838056
4558. the recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement	seen by some as part of the san francisco renaissance have	been as popular as they are notorious.	16.209024086764956
4559. it might well start a craze	like swallowing goldfish or pee wee golf wrote kenneth rexroth	in an explanatory note in the evergreen review and he may have	been right.	10.032688517669083
4560. under the general heading poetry-and-jazz widely	divergent experiments have been carried out.	16.51160594453285
4561. lawrence ferlenghetti	and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry	for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical	forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician.	7.942007211608851
4562. even musicians themselves	have taken to writing poetry.	16.955281935266644
4563. but the best known exploiters	of the new medium are kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen.	12.402168638878926
4564. rexroth	and patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments.	10.957705180640192
4565. rexroth is a longtime jazz buff a name-dropper of jazz heroes	and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz.	8.673334949869757
4566. in san francisco	he has worked with brew moore charlie mingus and other	swinging musicians of secure reputation thus placing himself within	established jazz traditions in addition to being a part of the	san francisco school.	12.285933205656725
4567. although patchen has given previous	evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he works	with the chamber jazz sextet is often ignored by jazz critics.	8.553264734134629
4568. did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen	the	stated goal of the cjs is the synthesis of jazz and serious	music.	10.75487626300862
4569. patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles	and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry	group maintaining a self-imposed isolation even though his conversion	to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first	appear.	7.793402435956211
4570. he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 and	his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with	the form and presentation of his poetry.	10.936834682323765
4571. however his subject matter	and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent and these together	with certain key poetic images may be traced through all his	work including the new jazz experiments.	7.8260130314527245
4572. from the beginning of	his career patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry.	14.67235004425294
4573. his first book before the brave is a collection	of poems that are almost all communistic but after publication of this	book he rejected	communism and advocated a pacifistic anarchy though	retaining his revolutionary idiom.	7.542771347175282
4574. he spoke for a proletariat	that included all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth.	12.463300780809424
4575. patchen	believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and	money-hungry people.	11.45008343092678
4576. running counter to the destroying forces in the	world are all the virtues that are innate in man the capacity for love	and brotherhood the ability to appreciate beauty.	10.246077182734421
4577. beauty as well	as love is redemptive and patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation.	9.556391774583105
4578. this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven.	19.48944163982346
4579. in	patchen's eyes organized churches are as odious as organized governments	and christian symbols having been taken over by the moneyed	classes are now agents of corruption.	7.733290753478543
4580. patchen envisions a dark kingdom	which stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger	from his own kind.	9.64018614629724
4581. the dark kingdom sends angels of death	and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness.	9.831416058686937
4582. actually	heaven and the dark kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of	heavenly life after death.	10.11881746645696
4583. patchen has almost never used strict	poetic forms; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making.	8.62963042412541
4584. much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a pseudo-anthropological	myth reference which is concerned with imaginary places	and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language.	12.00339368012635
4585. these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying	to patchen.	11.481684463108646
4586. beginning in cloth of the tempest he experimented	in merging poetry and visual art using drawings to carry long	narrative segments of a story as in sleepers awake and constructing	elaborate poems-in-drawing-and-type in which it is impossible	to distinguish between	the art and the poetry.	9.927769230754175
4587. art makings	or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of patchen's requirements	for a poetic frame of reference.	8.465382674200855
4588. many of his poems purported	to be exactly contemporary and political; so during the period approximately	from 1941 to 1946 patchen often used private detective stories	as a myth reference and the private eye as a myth hero.	10.285879960677129
4589. speaking	in terms of sociological stereotype the private eye might	appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons.	8.784567334421629
4590. the private	detective	is an individual hero fighting injustice.	16.386222825564015
4591. he is usually	something of an underdog he must battle the organized police force as	well as recognized criminals.	11.01293823560806
4592. the private detective must rely as the	youngest son or trickster hero does in primitive myth on his wits.	10.974046222174103
4593. the private detective is militant against injustice a humorous	and ironic explorer of the underworld; most important to patchen he	was a non-literary hero and very contemporary.	8.336377282749952
4594. in 1945 probably almost	every american not only knew who sam spade was but had some	kind of emotional feeling about him.	11.50744743725649
4595. in the memoirs of a shy pornographer	patchen exploited this national sentiment by making	his hero albert budd a private detective.	10.394911978858806
4596. but since 1945	sam spade has undergone a metamorphosis; he has become friday	on dragnet a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority.	11.726069546143199
4597. he has	like so many other secular and religious culture symbols gone over to	the side of the ruling classes.	11.019137959136852
4598. obviously the private eye can	have no more appeal for patchen.	15.690543416573801
4599. to fill the job of contemporary hero	in 1955 patchen needed someone else.	13.3865080212906
4600. it was logical that	he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician.	26.1645537251628
4601. the revolution	in jazz that took place around 1949 the evolution from the bebop	school of dizzy gillespie to the cool sound of miles	davis and lennie tristano lee konitz and the whole legend of	charlie parker had made an impression on many academic and literary	men.	7.338661837587678
4602. the differentiation between the east coast and west coast schools	of jazz the differences between the hard bop school of rollins	and the cerebral experiments of tristano konitz and	marsh the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians	all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public.	8.595784903031777
4603. the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger	generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the	merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union	of graphic art and poetry.	8.425557555218196
4604. in addition to his experiments in reading	poetry to jazz patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern	jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the	private detective a decade ago.	14.213186207162556
4605. in this respect his approach to poetry-and-jazz	is in marked contrast to kenneth rexroth's.	14.153637469275516
4606. rexroth	uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz including many of	his chinese and japanese translations; he usually draws some kind	of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading-	for instance he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an oriental	courtesan waiting for the man she loves and who never comes	and the old blues chants of ma rainy and other negro singers- but	usually the comparison is specious.	7.91919103694622
4607. rexroth may sometimes achieve an	effective juxtaposition but he rarely makes any effort to capture any	jazz feeling in the text of his poems relying on his very competent	musicians to supply this feeling.	7.610079235905783
4608. patchen does read some	of his earlier works to music but he has written an entire book of	short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz.	10.481767033819093
4609. these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians	but they show changes in patchen's approach to his poetry	for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude	of the jazz musician.	7.8193628880084285
4610. it is difficult to draw the line between	stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician.	23.666666793820184
4611. everyone knows that	private detectives in real life are not like sam spade and pat novak	but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked.	9.164973581891365
4612. seen	by the public the musician is the underdog par excellence.	12.04824024138872
4613. he	is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to	live.	9.120887403829277
4614. his approach to music is highly individualistic; the accent	is on improvisation rather than arrangements.	10.92826708374373
4615. while he is worldly the	musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment	and naivete.	11.406595440723777
4616. the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he	is far from being a literary hero yet is a creative artist.	12.752748422358286
4617. many of	these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective	but where the detective is active and militant the jazz musician	is passive almost a victim of society.	9.462676909227577
4618. in order to write with authority	either about musicians or as a musician patchen would have to soft	pedal his characteristically outspoken anger and change	from a revolutionary to a victim.	12.25287096773819
4619. he	must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world but	who declines doing anything about it.	10.20048283450111
4620. this involves a shift in	patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz	poetry.	14.167750742079638
4621. he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest	symbols and devices to the new work and the fact that he has kept a	body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected	continuity to his poetry.	11.401651277614551
4622. perhaps tracing some of these more important	symbols through the body of his work will show that patchen's	new poetry is well thought out and remains within the mainstream	of his work while being suited to a new form.	9.90830269053264
4623. henry miller characterized	patchen as a man of anger and light.	15.554396666287992
4624. his revolutionary	anger is apparent in most of his early poems.	14.417857094617412
4625. the following passage	from the hangman's great hands illustrates the directness	of this anger.	11.511258304365017
4626. i was born angry.	32.97293988802503
4627. angry	that my father was being burnt alive in the mills; angry that none	of us knew anything but filth and poverty.	7.811867791937725
4628. angry because i was that	very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for.	13.803386198067951
4629. this	angry and exasperated stance which patchen has maintained in his poetry	for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind	of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval	of the modern world.	6.932184454220701
4630. in his recent book hurray for anything	one of the most important short poems- and it is the title	poem for one of the long jazz arrangements- is written for recital	with jazz.	16.210971706149007
4631. although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues	to be sung the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling.	10.389062921472105
4632. i	went to the city and there i did weep men a-crowing likes asses	and living like sheep.	12.177355442988645
4633. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her little white han! yes i went to the city and	there i did bitterly cry men out of touch with the earth and	with never a glance at the sky.	8.776890996269431
4634. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her pure little han'! patchen is still	the rebel but he writes in a doleful mournful tone.	9.166890155686923
4635. neither of these	poems is an aberration; each is so typical that it represents a prominent	trend in the poet's development.	9.630219440701946
4636. patchen is repeatedly	preoccupied with death.	15.068811854765874
4637. in many of his poems death comes by train:	a strongly evocative visual image.	15.281048423286977
4638. perhaps patchen was once involved	in a train accident and this passage from first will and testament	may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he	first saw it- if he did:   lord love us look at all the	disconnected limbs floating hereabouts like bloody feathers at that-	and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the	tongue are in all the cheek h.	8.337432564039403
4639. let us see just how typical krim is.	16.698345759475167
4640. he is new york-born	and jewish.	30.398660165108797
4641. he spent one year at the university of north carolina	because thomas wolfe went there.	14.49548426270438
4642. he returned to new york to work	for the new yorker to edit a western pulp to duck the war	in the owi to write publicity for paramount pictures and	commentary for a newsreel then he began his career as critic for various	magazines.	10.963806452985793
4643. now he has abandoned all that to be a writer.	16.86775566013594
4644. i do	not want to quibble about typicality; in a certain sense one manner	of experience will be typical of any given group while another will	not.	10.622505097723584
4645. but i've got news for krim: he's not typical he's pretty special.	11.585470758711296
4646. his may typify a certain kind of postwar new york experience	but his experience is certainly not typical of his generation's.	10.755507279743917
4647. in any case who ever thought that new york is typical of anything?	14.700428535914279
4648. 	men of krim's age aspirations and level of sophistication	were typically involved in politics before the war.	9.723773562266802
4649. they did	not duck the war but they fought in it however reluctantly;	they sweated out some kind of formal education; they read widely and	eclectically;	they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous	magazines but they did whatever nasty thing they could get	in order to eat; they found out who they were and what they could do	then within the limits of their talent they did it.	7.630348146686335
4650. they did not worry	about experience because experience thrust itself upon them.	17.564195548477787
4651. and they traveled out of new york.	18.161736657803726
4652. only a native new yorker could	believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center.	11.78638551645663
4653. it	is a publishing and public relations center but these very facts prevent	it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism	and untruth.	9.114268593116153
4654. krim's typicality consists only in his new yorker's	view that new york is the world; he displays what outlanders	call the new york mind a state that the subject is necessarily unable	to perceive in himself.	9.66263201074337
4655. the new york mind is two parts abstraction	and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact	the world.	14.988456692112655
4656. in his fulminating against the literary world krim is	really struggling with the new yorker in himself but it's a losing	battle.	11.477865618922431
4657. closely related to his illusions about his typicality	is krim's complicated feeling about his jewishness.	9.138855500318167
4658. he writes	most of my friends and i were jewish; we were also literary;	the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility	needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and	incredible intellectual-literary ambition i have ever seen or could ever	have imagined.	10.93966361519416
4659. within themselves just as people my friends were	often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this	unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed; their reading and thinking	gave	an extension to their normal blushes about appearing 'jewish'	in subway bus racetrack movie house any of the public places that	used to make the jew of my generation self-conscious	walking across seventh avenue without their glasses on willing to	dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature	h.	7.7037799218895415
4660. at other points in his	narrative krim associates jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition	with abstraction with his personal turning aside from the good	the true and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of james t	farrell to the international the false and the inflated.	9.301587284415811
4661. krim says in short that he is a suffering jew.	13.1300318773799
4662. the only possible	answer to that is i am a suffering franco-irishman.	16.933307551785873
4663. we all love	to suffer but some of us love to suffer more than others.	12.97644656235026
4664. had krim	gone	farther from new york than chapel hill he might have discovered	that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version	of the jews' lot remotely recognizable.	11.061728245035173
4665. more important is the	simple human point that all men suffer and that it is a kind of	anthropological-religious	pride on the part of the jew to believe that his suffering	is more poignant than mine or anyone else's.	14.918292140623526
4666. this is not to	deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos but only to assert that these	horrors	have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience	them that among the various side effects is the local hysteria	of jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion which	they call oppression and pain.	10.652664754751148
4667. in their stupidity and arrogance they	believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms	and ghettos.	0.0
4668. some of us have imagination and sensibility too.	20.905994214910937
4669. finally there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest american	fiction is being written by jews but it is not jewish fiction;	saul bellow and bernard malamud through intellectual toughness	perception through experience in fact have obviously liberated	themselves from any sentimental krim self-indulgence they might have	been tempted to.	8.985184494734785
4670. krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and	the publishing apparatus of american literary culture in our day.	9.559225930701576
4671. krim was able to get an advance for a novel and time and opportunity	to write at yaddo but it was no good.	9.980217565406981
4672. i had natural sock he	says 'as a storyteller and was precociously good at description dialogue	and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade	but i was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that	prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained	fiction-writing.	10.257472323224553
4673. and again how can you write when you haven't	yet read 'bartleby the scrivener'?	11.771599145938323
4674.  krim came to believe	that the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning.	10.831078464129813
4675. his	articulate jewish friends convinced him that education	was a must.	10.853317511209376
4676. he moved in a highly intellectual	group in greenwich village in the late forties becoming internationalized	overnight.	14.127043147818434
4677. then followed a period in which he wrote reviews	for the new york times book review the commonweal commentary	had a small piece in partisan review and moved on	to hudson the village voice and exodus.	8.944654757181228
4678. the work for	commonweal	was more satisfying than work for commentary because	of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo.	11.758752465179091
4679. commentary	was a mere suburb of partisan review the arch-enemy.	10.057988591011652
4680. both	magazines were rigid with reactionary what-will-t s eliot-or-martin	buber-think?	12.3482207866056
4681.  fear h.	19.137741945722095
4682. partisan has failed	krim says for being snob-clannish overcerebral europeanish aristocratically	alienated from the us.	10.358652090748608
4683. it was the creation	of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize	literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with	its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in spenglerian inclusiveness	h.	10.603614718389371
4684. kenyon sewanee and hudson operated in an anglo-protestant	new critical chill; their example caused krim	and his friends to put on englishy airs affect all sorts of	impressive	scholarship and social-register unnaturalness h in order to	slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages.	8.37350810121786
4685. qui	s'excuse s'accuse as the french jewish intellectuals used	to say.	10.057988591011652
4686. through all this raving krim is performing a traditional	and by now boring rite the attack on intelligence upon the largely	successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate american	writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn.	8.46703498805649
4687. god	knows that partisan and the rest often were and remain guilty	of intellectual flatulence.	9.486166495666744
4688. sociological jargon germano-slavic	approximations to english third-rate but modish fiction and outrages	to common sense have often disfigured partisan and in lesser degree	the other magazines on the list.	8.628793231021637
4689. what krim ignores in his contempt	for history and for accuracy is that these magazines partisan	foremost brought about a genuine revolution in the american mind	from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950.	8.43138119239058
4690. the most obvious characteristic	of contemporary american writing apart from the beat nonsense	is its cosmopolitanism.	14.192453282298631
4691. the process of cosmopolitanism	had begun in earnest about 1912 but the first war and the depression	virtually stalled that process in its tracks.	10.732646766456398
4692. without the good magazines	without their book reviews their hospitality to european writers	without above all their awareness of literary standards we might	very well have had a generation of krim's heroes- wolfes farrells	dreisers and i might add sandburgs and frosts and macleishes	in verse- and then where would we be?	8.260820667262458
4693.  screwed stewed and tattooed	as krim might say after reading a book about sailors.	8.834168570742513
4694. when	partisan and kenyon set up shop mencken was still accepted	as an arbiter of taste george jean nathan	and alexander woollcott were honored in odd quarters and the whole	booth tarkington willa catheter pearl buck amy	lowell william lyon phelps atmosphere lay thick as los angeles	smog over the country.	7.865256496474766
4695. politics economics sociology- the	entire area of life that lies between literature and what krim calls	experience- urgently needed to be dug into.	8.159223072538488
4696. the universities	certainly were not doing it nor were the popular magazines of the day.	11.636095537390238
4697. this partisan above all did; if it had never printed a word	of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would	still be historic.	10.064198276039967
4698. but it did print good verse and good fiction.	24.75712338318251
4699. if	the editors sometimes dozed and printed pretentious new york-mind	dross they also printed malraux silone chiaromonte gide bellow	robert lowell francis fergusson mary mccarthy delmore	schwartz mailer elizabeth hardwick eleanor clark and a host	of other good writers.	7.217694266338047
4700. partisan review and the other literary magazines	helped to educate in the best sense an entire generation.	11.459138644570029
4701. that	these magazines also deluded the krims of the world is unfortunate	but inevitable.	12.639017220789727
4702. it is a fact of life that magazines are edited by	groups: they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all.	16.96375442326965
4703. and	it is also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated	people around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like	a literary movement.	9.487731014114914
4704. only writers doing their work.	19.770245076540558
4705. literary movements are the creation of	when krim says mine was as severe a	critical-intellectual environment as can be imagined he is off his	rocker.	8.32947331447407
4706. he indicates that he has none of the disciplines that criticism	requires including education; the result was his inevitable bedazzlement	through ignorance.	14.080224058399688
4707. he wasn't being educated in those village	bull-sessions as he claims.	12.382440355398003
4708. no one was ever educated through bull-sessions	in anything other than to quote him again perfumed bullshit.	12.682621602756853
4709. only a new york hick would expect to find the literary	life in greenwich village at any point later than walt whitman's	day.	10.820729358110231
4710. the highly intellectual h minds that krim says he encountered	in the village did their work in spite of not because of any	village atmosphere.	11.29589616862208
4711. but krim's complaint is important because not	only in new york but in other cities and in universities throughout	this country young and not so young men at this moment are being	bedazzled by half-digested ideas.	9.618478663530036
4712. those who have quality will outgrow	the experience; the rest will turn beat or into dentists or into	beat dentists.	12.930384421060486
4713. for the sad truth is that while one might write	well without having read bartleby the scrivener one is more	likely to write well if one has read it and much else.	8.998181043031723
4714. the most appalling	aspect of krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic.	16.671556221702087
4715. he mentions the beats only once when he refers to their having revived	through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit	death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression	and actual experience h but the entire narrative is written	in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause and in the	sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant our mother tongue.	7.77384586104568
4716. krim's	aesthetic combines anti-intellectualism conscious and unconscious	nai^vete and a winsome reliance upon the natural and upon experience.	10.098469922984828
4717. ideas are the thruway to nowhere.	11.867291106449708
4718. my touchstones	h had been strictly literature and humanly enough american	literature.	12.370536912036139
4719. he alludes	to something called direct writing and he finds that criticism	gets in the way of his truer realer imaginative bounce.	11.636886978110445
4720. there had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and	defacing of the bust of lauro di bosis near the villa lante and in	the gianicolo.	11.464638579245348
4721. something was happening all right slowly it	is true but you could feel it.	10.06582721631763
4722. an italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around	the area of quirinal palace the first time since the war.	12.275607944984163
4723. at least	they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated flat	dialect mispronunciation of mussolini's home district- dogumenti	per favore.	8.96246550495147
4724. but who knew that might be coming one of these days.	19.534353587675124
4725. there were other italians who still bore scars they had earned	in police station basements resisting.	12.61367500837585
4726. they laughed and true to national	form and manners never talked long or solemnly on any subject	at	all but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts.	11.725646449710899
4727. we saw giuseppe berto at a party once in a while tall lean	nervous and handsome and in our opinion the best novelist of them	all except pavese and pavese is dead.	7.990241742340058
4728. berto's the sky is	red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book	to come out of the war.	11.905497286615319
4729. now he was married to a beautiful girl had	a small son and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the	movies.	9.894301637319339
4730. on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of	the count of monte cristo.	12.877984371498206
4731. on his bookshelves were some of	the latest american novels including bellow's seize the day	but he hadn't read them and	wasn't especially interested in what the american writers were up	to.	8.704442612325705
4732. he was interested in robert musil's the man without qualities.	17.119917508560324
4733. so were a lot of other people.	16.56301144261548
4734. he was interested in italo	svevo.	28.60604811390337
4735. he was thinking his way into a new novel a big one one that	people had been waiting for.	10.4334787896235
4736. it was going to be hard going all the	way because he hadn't written seriously for a while except for a few	stories was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully	used in the sky is red.	12.845383821225953
4737. this one was going to be different.	27.69746518879001
4738. he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast	of the hard country of calabria that he knew so well.	12.037175083835306
4739. he was going	to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all leave rome	and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life go back to calabria.	9.657485110864425
4740. he knew all about it and had put	it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful	book not for some strange reason published in the us.	12.32093847904198
4741. he	knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor	southern peasant boy.	8.728268885574947
4742. he knew all about the infection and the fever	and too the moment of realization when he saw for himself threw up	his hands and quit ended the war as a prisoner in texas.	11.085295462783609
4743. berto knew	all about fascism.	14.19641732877796
4744. so did his friend the young novelist rimanelli.	16.32533867261939
4745. rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous says what he	thinks.	9.669550099771405
4746. he had put it down in a war novel the day of the lion.	19.441353884519994
4747. these people were not talking much about it but you a foreigner	sensed their apprehension and disappointment.	9.32616081787728
4748. so there we were	talking around and about it.	15.18590171628798
4749. the english lady said she had to go	to vienna for a while.	11.498097934249422
4750. it was a pity because she had planned to lay	a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue towering over rome in	spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo.	13.663295385943709
4751. around	that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos	and there is a glowing view of the whole city in that park are the	rows of marble busts of garibaldi's fallen men the ones who one	day rushed out of the porta san pancrazio and under fire all the way	up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground	of the villa doria pamphili.	7.168077525298866
4752. when they lost it the french artillery	moved in and that was the end for garibaldi that time on 30	april 1849.	14.151887137830998
4753. once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow	lane.	12.352142638441007
4754. we had walked it many times and shivered figuring what a	fish barrel it had been for the french.	14.674784893019792
4755. now the park is filled with	marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and	proper names of the men who fell.	11.763814261520036
4756. we were at a party once and	heard an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious.	12.829937789760706
4757. our companion was a huge plain-spoken american sculptor who had	been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across france in 1944.	8.639702279009489
4758. he said	it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that no	matter who gave the order and what for.	11.238270958561493
4759. oh it would be butchery	all right	the european said.	13.97292336316276
4760. we would see it that way but	it was glorious then.	16.761322663084975
4761. it was the last time in history anybody could	do something gloriously like that.	0.0
4762. i thought: who is	older now?	22.608144352367685
4763.  old world and new world.	14.810599317726165
4764. the sculptor looked at	him bugeyed and amazed angry.	15.227221353292695
4765. he had made an assault once with 180	men.	20.443137492151287
4766. it was a picked assault company.	36.43557589258997
4767. they went up against an ss	unit of comparable size over a little rise of ground over an open	field.	9.933802893294194
4768. they made it killed every last	one of the krauts took the village on schedule.	11.99469611920502
4769. when it was over	eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded.	13.349175769036737
4770. the	whole thing from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks	spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight	rise of ground and then jumped off took maybe between twenty and	thirty minutes.	8.661393109524262
4771. the sculptor looked at him let the color drain out	of his face grinned and looked down into his drink a bad martini	made with raw italian gin.	8.002376995614425
4772. excuse me the european said.	15.068811854765874
4773. i am not familiar with	the expression.	24.073398256801294
4774. the apartment where we were talking that afternoon	in march faced onto the street garibaldi's men had charged	up and along.	10.351870993004653
4775. across the way from the apartment building is a ruined	house shot to hell that day in 1849 and left that way as a memorial.	9.90615386678637
4776. there is a bronze wreath on the wall.	32.697879112592595
4777. like everything else in rome	ruins and monuments alike that house is lived in.	9.960769701845084
4778. i have seen diapers	strung across the ruined roof.	21.016621917189273
4779. the english lady really	wanted to put a wreath on the garibaldi monument on the 30th of april.	10.406107510265949
4780. she had her reasons for this.	22.153926734713306
4781. for one thing there wasn't going	to be any ceremony at all this year.	15.08234975323695
4782. there were a few reasons for that	too: garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the communists	nowadays.	18.60178952535445
4783. therefore the government wanted no part of him.	12.702939641858286
4784. sort of as if our government should decide to disown washington or lincoln	and then there were ecclesiastical matters	the matter of garibaldi's anti-clericalism.	8.951887347307554
4785. there was a new pope	and the vatican was making itself heard and felt these days.	14.606008816100417
4786. as	it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself but of more	liberal political persuasion.	10.804951756693796
4787. nothing was going to be done this year	to celebrate garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of rome.	13.106162639059765
4788. all	that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument	and lay a wreath at its base.	10.507681460221269
4789. this would show that somebody even a foreigner	living in rome cared.	14.28480691934799
4790. and then there were other things.	24.425011696699297
4791. some	of the marble busts in the park are of young englishmen who fought	and died for garibaldi.	9.167434997828448

4810. no poetry no airplanes no dancers.	17.470520088186518
4811. that is how the real	routine of resistance goes on and its strength is directly proportionate	to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be	taken to pieces piece by piece without quitting.	8.761357094387689

4819. i understand very well about lauro di bosis and how his action	is symbolic.	10.95066703474372

4833. though garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to pickett's	charge- which like all southerners i view in almost miltonic	terms fallen angels etc- i associated the two.	8.10250258847672
4834. and to top	it all i am often sentimental on purpose trying to prove to myself	that i am not afraid of sentiment.	11.858574935951

4914. information application forms and assistance in filing may be	obtained from the office of minerals exploration us department	of the interior washington 25 dc or from the appropriate	regional office listed below:	in most of the less developed countries however such programing	is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent.	9.03326076362239
4915. only a very few of	the more advanced ones such as india and pakistan have developed	systematic techniques of programing.	10.028569351235596
4916. others have so-called development	plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects	collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals	without analysis of the actions required to attain them.	11.5290473573881
4917. only rarely	we	neither growth nor a development	program can be imposed on a country; it must express the nation's	own will and goal.	8.853242143822426
4918. nevertheless we can administer an aid program	in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.	12.685070801868713
4919. first we can encourage responsibility by establishing	as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the	definition of objectives and the assessment of costs.	8.137981684672644
4920. second	we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on	the consistency of such projects with the program.	9.723773562266802
4921. third	we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development	which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources.	8.47099306934427
4922. this	includes assistance in- h assembling the basic economic financial	technological and educational information on which programing depends;	h surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad	sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication	industry and power; h designing the financial mechanisms of the	economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation; and h	administrative practices which will make possible the more effective	we must use	the application of conditions	in the allocation	of aid funds cannot of course be mechanical.	7.928291440818023
4923. it must	be recognized that countries at different stages of development have	very different capabilities of meeting such conditions.	11.014608730125218
4924. to insist	on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond	the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration	of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage	more rapid growth.	8.869200154829286
4925. in the more primitive areas where the capacity	to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities	may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them	before a well worked out program is available.	8.995054278800561
4926. thus we might provide	limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport	communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of	acceptable country programs.	10.203891656630343
4927. in such a case however we would encourage	the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply	it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and	make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance	to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress	being made.	8.022755439505932
4928. at the other end of the spectrum where the	more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through	decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program we should	be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval	as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support	in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential	foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program.	9.587884739698879
4929. a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing	is one important kind of self-help.	9.966061740790925
4930. it is vitally	important that the new us aid program should encourage all	of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less	developed countries themselves.	13.366833723936946
4931. external aid can only be marginal	although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive.	13.089083796726285
4932. external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help.	14.683779809593279
4933. us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to	provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves	can take.	8.898660897524337
4934. in establishing	conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries	to remake themselves in our image.	14.574985972890259
4935. open societies can take many forms	and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their	own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals.	7.249814601282316
4936. on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point	out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories	without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel	to staff them.	11.575027091836231
4937. once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned	with a country's development potential we can be blunt in suggesting	the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur.	9.48298487570111
4938. the major areas of self-help	are the following:	this includes not only development programing but also establishing	tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment;	fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation;	and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial	resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury	the reduction of dependence on external	sources.	8.38695354597106
4939. with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting	realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports.	9.049813537116664
4940. it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate	tapping the energies of	for both economic and political reasons	all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth	of a country.	13.291978387718828
4941. otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability.	14.013204198619528
4942. in many societies what we	regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted	as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part	of	routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination	will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted	but unfriendly.	8.7907068672334
4943. yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources	if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread.	11.146450160917103
4944. moreover	tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion	of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-american	sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest.	11.706823567330717
4945. some	of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support	can be traced to the identification- correct or not- of communist	regimes with personal honesty and pro-western regimes with corruption.	7.7411782864854635
4946. a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically	uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential	in the long run.	10.96936544829358
4947. the united	states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with	aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries	making serious efforts in self-help.	7.926015079532906
4948. in many instances it	can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such	efforts.	13.237857516453076
4949. there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy	we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups	in government which would like to press forward with economic and social	reform measures to promote growth.	9.482580540196796
4950. but there will be still other countries where despite	the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political	or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance.	13.001611148456002
4951. even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that	our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to	termination.	11.9355782600924
4952. development	the most fundamental concept of	the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our	resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and	social development of the less developed countries.	9.571424821205937
4953. this is not a short-run	goal.	45.27775775028163
4954. to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view	it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years	and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same	fashion.	10.514930413381474
4955. how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort	will vary greatly from country to country.	10.07568663987422
4956. in several significant cases	such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these	countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic	and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance.	10.879783342897902
4957. these cases in which light is already visible at the other	end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb	gradually others will move up to	the number of countries thus favorably situated is	small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the	underdeveloped world.	8.805820194722408
4958. meantime over the decade of the sixties we	can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big	push into self-sustaining growth.	10.045536830010276
4959. in still others which are barely on	the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring	significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their	human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded	aid is a long-term	process stretching	over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social	and economic conditions in the less developed world.	7.904144728806718
4960. it must be recognized	as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military	crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba.	12.68347724924555
4961. the specific reasons for a long-term approach the need to	many of the individual projects for	which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy	periods.	8.72500163395448
4962. dams river development schemes transportation networks	educational systems require years to construct.	10.957705180640192
4963. moreover on complex	projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery	and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence.	8.950818206533663
4964. thus as a development program is being launched commitments and	obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by	twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year.	11.028999060397817
4965. the	capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting	the need	to plan investment programs.	9.584754106300414
4966. several of	the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through	experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for	at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than	that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities	involved are all to take place in the proper sequence.	11.74222096050129
4967. without such	forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities	are completed before there is power to operate them or before	there is transport to service them; or a skilled labor force is trained	before there are plants available in which they can be employed.	7.836437384149178
4968. most important	of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary	steps to allocate and commit their own resources.	10.697877283539706
4969. they must	be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory	policies.	11.582040778958374
4970. they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help	measures which are described in the preceding section.	12.479671228211231
4971. the taking	of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions.	12.204673387645432
4972. moreover	once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves	felt.	13.463127291579934
4973. they must therefore be related to long-range development	plans.	15.836744786646207
4974. if the less developed countries	are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the united states	as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give	long-term commitments.	11.276397582819794
4975. in this as in so many aspects of our development	assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take	are the most important ones.	11.92663682747711
4976. the extent to which we can persuade	the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets	toward which they should be working to establish in the light	of this forward	perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate	attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves	all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly	on the incentives we place before them.	9.93279152381139
4977. if they feel that we are taking	a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into	reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities	they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required.	9.080016286438386
4978. perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear	evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we	have responded with long-term commitments.	12.415544833076162
4979. you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost	50 years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and	the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs	come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation	that mankind has ever known.	8.578392443101313
4980. then i have seen the pride of country	well in the eyes of these young people.	15.845482254572884
4981. so i say mr speaker	god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body	but for the united states of america and the free world.	16.590807655762035
4982. you remember	the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone	asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and	vice president johnson was in asia who is running the	store?	11.194287297557427
4983.  and he said the same fellow who has been running it sam	rayburn.	19.390074659575177
4984. mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire	to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record;	and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend	their remarks.	12.01145390846677
4985. is there objection	to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts?	15.806106555834559
4986.    there was	no objection.	43.258347275766134
4987. it is notably significant that so many members	from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for	our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn.	11.295269334759194
4988. i purposely	refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from	the state of texas.	15.026808250625203
4989. i did so because i agree with so many here	today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united	states.	13.48427875434586
4990. for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative	branch of our government- it is a privilege for us to do honor	to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all	the people of our country.	11.964768768772396
4991. to honor him is to honor ourselves.	14.19805773323796
4992. in this my first year as a member of this body i have experienced	many memorable moments.	19.00582692787273
4993. many of these experiences are so important	that they will be cherished forever by me.	14.49146518630018
4994. and like many of you here	present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting	with the honorable speaker of the house.	12.55232366563282
4995. at that time he afforded	me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need	to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national	and local topics and any problems that i may have been vexed with	at the time.	0.0
4996. he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me	and tremendously wise in his counsel.	13.427572304012472
4997. in conclusion he wished me well-	and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express	himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children.	8.36962092668347
4998. in	my short period here i believe that at no time has he been otherwise	than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle.	13.002627804326009
4999. he is most effective	in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative	accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion- even	at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle-	and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted	by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a	noble partisan.	9.245844647754172
5000. i am highly privileged today to commemorate the	brilliant career of this parliamentary giant.	14.288627928755243
5001. he will ever be my example	as a true statesman; one who is thoroughly human who affects	no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and	sterling honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the	country he has loved and served so long.	8.554807718477338
5002. may the divine speaker in	heaven bless this country with sam rayburn's continued service	here for years to come.	10.656950808991922
5003. it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for	me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues	in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam	rayburn.	10.976103836289049
5004. in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the	stabilizing force that he represents in current american government	is an almost indispensable source of strength.	11.531571018091025
5005. he has become in this	half century the grand old man of american history.	12.212383131034406
5006. it seems to me	that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition	to providence that sam rayburn's vigor and his life remain	undiminished through the coming decades.	12.323311151828706
5007. here briefly in this	humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation	that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country.	8.298192232282805
5008. but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress	in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam	rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman	and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this	nation.	9.396683583659652
5009. it happens that i am a legislator from ohio and that i feel	deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district	and my state.	10.804642518841542
5010. what sam rayburn's life proves to us all is	the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and	with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests	of one's own community one's own district one's own state	and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of	the problems of this the greatest nation of all time.	8.057144458304906
5011. for sam	rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never	forgot texas.	10.993368958818879
5012. in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as	legislators to our community our district our state.	16.305120436147586
5013. and if we	follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual	political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature	of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected	in the devotion of our services to our country.	8.52961380130152
5014. for what sam	rayburn's life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character	are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your	country and neglecting your district.	13.204184896059601
5015. there is no such thing as being	diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs.	22.62984569506822
5016. the	two are as one.	16.6462465444584
5017. this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes	close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburn's career up to	this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political	life under our processes of government.	10.259374447206879
5018. more than that	sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity	so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count	some of his best friends in the opposition.	10.938733527155222
5019. through the most rancorous	battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national	and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example	of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility.	8.707189329978545
5020. sam rayburn	has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and	ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political	manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions.	8.909283394428682
5021. this means much to	the american tradition.	20.982394141929568
5022. it is an answer in its way individual and	highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily	vicious in its campaign characteristics.	14.29445177530205
5023. and the name rayburn	is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for	the last half century.	14.106782297718478
5024. it is i insist hard to define the	rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is	so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes	so deep.	11.681346515310729
5025. but this we know: here is a great life that in every area	of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride	and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities	of honor decency and self-respect.	9.560492215502904
5026. i pray to god that he may	be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the united	states and the whole world can ill afford to lose.	13.48085131789443
5027. of hon melvin price of illinois	all but two	of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under	the speakership of sam rayburn.	10.134921084193923
5028. of this i am proud.	29.989363380880405
5029. i have	a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility	with which he carries his greatness.	10.182301093952058
5030. and sam rayburn	is a great man- one who will go down in american history as a truly	great leader of the nation.	12.80436769262681
5031. he will be considered not only great	among his contemporaries but as great among all the americans who	have played a part in the country's history since the beginning.	10.429275939169791
5032. i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and	great american not only because today he establishes a record of	having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than	twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has	made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half	century of service as a member of congress.	13.977231866698354
5033. speaker rayburn	has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction	of the house in the speaker's chair.	9.02173359030251
5034. he had an outstanding record	as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in 1913	the 63d congress.	18.756572185054985
5035. no one has sponsored more progressive and important	legislation than has sam rayburn.	12.56834129712175
5036. he is the recognized father	of the rural electrification administration and the security	and exchange commission.	16.814745811466306
5037. but to run the gauntlet of the programs	sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts	would fill the pages of today's record.	9.971070804148155
5038. no greater pleasure	has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present	today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great	legislator this great texan this great american.	9.523784397235366
5039. my sincere	wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today.	10.507407020224402
5040. sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures	in the history of our country and i consider that i have been	signally honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing	with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of	representatives in the congress of the united states.	13.131068738016861
5041. others	may speak of speaker rayburn's uniquely long and devoted	service; of his championship of many of the progressive social measures	which adorn our statute books today and of his cooperation in times	of adversity with presidents of both of our major parties in helping	to pilot the ship of state through the shoals of today's stormy	international seas.	7.170519741977202
5042. i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn	the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution.	11.6712801854844
5043. although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in	many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart	and gentle disposition.	9.276662199184733
5044. no one could be more devoted than he to the	american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical	significance in the political history of the world and i shall never	forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon	the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative	government and their importance in the context of today's	assault upon popular government.	10.48560132642605
5045. above all he is a person to	whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional	problems which inevitably confront a new congressman.	10.450072959508885
5046. in	this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic	and most helpful.	10.847392870956543
5047. on september 16 sam rayburn will have	served as speaker twice as long as any predecessor and i am proud	to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my esteem	for that notable american sam rayburn.	8.082209370072292

5073. rhode island's rate of .	13.568592936511694
5074. 07 per mile is considerably lower than	reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally	which approximate a .	11.85958680945785
5075. actual mileage	allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state.	9.345058977386529
5076. the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement	are controlled properly and not overly restrictive.	12.214907163657244
5077. fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject.	11.118618003375188
5078. they have a great	advantage in ease of audit time and payment.	17.490688087592535
5079. however they lend themselves	to abuse and inadequate control measures.	12.62980217800384
5080. flat payments over	$50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of	state-owned vehicles.	11.173051488585791
5081. travel allowances including	subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently	and compare favorably with other states' allowances.	9.701933331657218
5082. with few	exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses	and $15 per day subsistence.	11.65559349365635
5083. travel allowances are well-regulated	and pose little problem in administration andor audit control.	9.070074471681158
5084. of state automobile practices	it	is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles	for use of employees in rhode island.	12.514132539556346
5085. few records are available	concerning the subject prior to 1940.	11.131229975813381
5086. those that are available	shed little light.	20.812447449144667
5087. the registry of motor vehicles indicates that	at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917.	10.2353719867555
5088. it	should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles	is at least forty years old.	15.935222972514834
5089. the best reason that can be	advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded	highway construction during the 1920s and '30s.	9.645487984377398
5090. at that time highway	engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties.	0.0
5091. using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees	and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly	justifiable.	10.096090893732828
5092. once the principle was established the increase	in state-owned vehicles came rapidly.	14.773599009014827
5093. and reasons other than employee	need contributed to the growth.	14.657135961268706
5094. table 1 immediately below shows	the rate of growth of vehicles and employees.	10.635267499930531
5095. this rate of increase	does not signify anything in itself.	12.508271769542546
5096. it does not indicate loose management	ineffective controls or poor policy.	22.848248966479893
5097. but it does show that automobiles	have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same	proportion to the increase of state employees.	12.533952344966915
5098. in the past twenty	years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied	from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now.	12.481300045214203
5099. whether there were too few automobiles	in 1940 or too many now is problematical.	9.968167398228813
5100. the fact is simply	that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion	history and operation of the motor	pool.	18.188869787744785
5101. subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management	of state automobiles can be related more clearly.	8.518314539970453
5102. prior to 1942	automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which	assigned.	16.063287025926904
5103. this responsibility included all phases of management.	17.24102039109483
5104. it	embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who	was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline	and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters.	10.135536995972425
5105. in 1942 however the nation was at war.	16.649932638888277
5106. gasoline and automobile tires	were rationed commodities.	13.915190642667962
5107. the state was confronted with transportation	problems similar to those of the individual.	17.65940373208185
5108. it met these problems	by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit	a centralized operation for the maintenance	and control of all state transportation.	13.64317598431261
5109. the motor pool then	as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located	throughout the state.	9.403879097775112
5110. it was organizationally the responsibility	of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund	basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation.	12.437202272831106
5111. in 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created	department of administration an agency established as the	central staff and auxiliary department of the state government.	9.659918704744044
5112. the management	of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in	a recent report in the following manner:   under this new	management considerable progress appears to have been made.	10.149309045717699
5113. the agencies	of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided	to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all	cars.	8.728015104895293
5114. whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained	losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing	system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping	the fund on a proper working basis.	10.375265811314838
5115. one indication of the merits of	the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956	while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% the	total maintenance cost increased only 11%.	10.644735810722683
5116. in order	to further refine the management of passenger vehicles on july 1 1958	the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by executive	order to the division of methods research and office services.	9.448108208611803
5117. the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility	for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles.	8.995044693120356
5118. this tied in closely with the	current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles	are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs	become excessive.	11.173041775883181
5119. moreover it allows the present management	to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly	distributed throughout the fleet; for example if one driver puts on	22000 miles per year and another driver 8000 miles per year their	cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30000 miles after two	years rather than 44000 miles	and 16000 miles respectively.	7.302444287163835
5120. the motor pool is a completely	centralized and mechanized operation.	14.310793878502059
5121. it handles all types of	vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities	than on extensive vehicle repairs.	10.511513581761168
5122. it contracts with outside	repair garages for much of the latter work.	24.478806238628515
5123. where the pool excels is	in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses.	10.744061234705763
5124. pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon	of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods	when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded	for sound economies.	8.686104641306262
5125. from this motor pool personnel develop other	meaningful and related data.	13.079853198786925
5126. in 1959-60 vehicles averaged an operating	cost of .	17.034822554424267
5127. based on this figure and considering depreciation	costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel	in excess of 10000 miles annually is more economical by state car	than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles.	7.790762939958001
5128. they	estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data	of compact cars is compiled the break-even point may be reduced to	7500 miles of travel per year.	8.700181695682264
5129. table 2 shows operating cost data of	state vehicles selected at random.	9.345058977386529
5130. one matter of concern to	the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate	central garage facilities.	12.230555999932825
5131. present pool quarters at two locations in	providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient	operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of	such operational needs as stock and repair equipment.	7.558728746565181
5132. good facilities	would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle	costs even more.	10.587372751202253
5133. the purchase of state-owned	vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases	of the state.	16.264559338196296
5134. requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary	cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will	be made.	9.859906987947285
5135. bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the	assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles	are made to the lowest responsible bidders.	8.50329149750689
5136. unit prices for state	vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public.	12.382599157725819
5137. the reasons	are obvious: it has no	federal excise or state sales tax to pay.	10.68885502559245
5138. until 1958 the state was also	entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the	dealers.	11.072024394773203
5139. in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state	motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies	but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier.	8.982535245622907
5140. this is a normal	governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting	principles.	21.11834132074209
5141. the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is	another matter to be covered in detail later.	10.374321372709895
5142. assignment and use policies	probably the most important of all matters	for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase	assignment use and management of state vehicles.	9.451052994413269
5143. the legislature's	role in policy determination in this area for years has been	confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually	for the purchase and operation of vehicles.	10.261537155906478
5144. the more meaningful policies	have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer	of the state- the director of administration.	14.978785724092832
5145. there was a time some years ago when	local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their	own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as	well.	16.113058548167395
5146. for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the	several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property	tax.	14.306710391999466
5147. this tax was discontinued in 1936.	15.755914550576229
5148. since that time	the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed	financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in	earlier years.	12.74422486653561
5149. at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion	of municipal services as well.	17.553651446032145
5150. thus there has come into being	a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and	in addition must give assistance to its local governments.	11.943015594014655
5151. this	financial assistance from the state has become necessary because	the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at	the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements.	8.628731565703204
5152. consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and	shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments	for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a	sales tax at the state level.	10.130337966948657
5153. notwithstanding state aid the local	governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own	by strengthening the property tax.	8.026882005052693
5154. this is being done both by the revaluation	of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property	hitherto neglected or ignored.	13.392123766496516
5155. taxation of tangible movable	property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature	due possibly to several reasons: local assessors in the main	are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs the numerous	categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely	difficult and the inexperience of the majority of assessors	problems of taxing personal	property.	6.850730434583621
5156. and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant:	situs fair and equitable assessment of value.	12.7053601534082
5157. these	problems are not local to rhode island but are recognized as common	to all states.	8.953104285872618
5158. although the laws of the various	states in general specify the situs of property ie residence	or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions	regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to	the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.	9.366272345181192
5159. rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the	town in which it is situated.	11.040677119576495
5160. it also provides for the taxation of all	personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible	and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents	in this state.	12.29158557418094
5161. in defining personal property it specifically mentions	all ships or vessels at home or abroad.	10.694184739355702
5162. intangible	property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater	portion of the year.	10.191933462586043
5163. although a similar situs for tangible property	is mentioned in the statute this is cancelled out by the provision	that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property	situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated.	7.8784131527065595
5164. this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property	at its location on december 31.	14.196316848028681
5165. both boats and aircraft would	fall within this category as well as motor vehicles.	11.2277422881734
5166. the location	of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration	and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle	as being situated where it is garaged.	12.363266841569956
5167. obviously it would be impossible	to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of december.	9.958379045755782
5168. in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles	for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would	seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or	aircraft.	13.899858332912174
5169. a recent example of this problem is the flying of six	airplanes on december 31 1960 from the newport airpark in middletown	to the north central airport in smithfield.	8.775710643070676
5170. this situation	resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably.	13.236737574390107
5171. middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all	rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed	to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his	actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve months	next preceding the first day of april in each year.	8.251152829926388
5172. the	smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision	of law h and all other tangible personal property situated or being	in any town in or upon any h place of storage h shall be taxed	to such person h in the town where said property is situated.	8.09620252935721
5173. this problem of fair and equitable assessment	of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of	fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are	non-professional	and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach	to the problem.	8.660259669856533
5174. this accounts for the wide variance in assessment	practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in	rhode island.	11.719520690663831
5175. this condition will undoubtedly continue until	such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established	or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method	of standard assessment practice to be adopted.	8.240174905516072
5176. the rhode	island public expenditure council in its publication once commented:	the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would	be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing	all taxable property.	9.365723329496017
5177. an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing	office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far	toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout	the state.	7.8403234978990435
5178. a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences	and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different	and independent assessing units.	10.952608062700822
5179. the institute of public	administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission	in 1959 recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects	of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally	organized and equipped for the job.	8.499516337613267
5180. the resulting setup it was	declared would be similar to that which is in successful operation	in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode	island.	13.247424869223828
5181. to determine the practice	and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property	a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or	boards of assessors in rhode island.	9.441977811551924
5182. the replies from each	individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the	personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the	established policy of the town in each case.	11.949258369888513
5183. there are legitimate reasons	for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among	the public officials in each town.	12.501676778190888
5184. these opinions of the assessors	are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at	the present time.	11.28787314715209
5185. in reply to a question of whether they now	tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles	nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not.	10.01307337040364
5186. the wording	of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different	interpretations.	13.103912391291939
5187. one assessor checked boats only another trailers	and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred	to trailers without specifying the type.	8.959652207302964
5188. in two cases airplanes only	were indicated.	20.472413001720973
5189. it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was	meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn	that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder	only certain types are valued for tax purposes.	9.711672193317847
5190. boats were indicated	specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats.	15.986254264694388
5191. it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed	as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound	to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property.	9.822727031801735
5192. so few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess	movable property that the results are inconclusive.	11.24966558311459
5193. only four towns indicated	that they made any more than a normal effort to list property	of this kind.	11.023424042319414
5194. of greater interest is a question as to whether	movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership.	14.002902487568116
5195. fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence	of the owner and nineteen did not answer.	10.194932204864642
5196. twenty-seven assessors	stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable	personal property and only five were opposed.	12.864821380902264
5197. seven others expressed	no opinion.	16.561633532207114
5198. on this point there was fairly general agreement that	assessors would like to do more than they are doing now.	16.765876937692006
5199. it is not	clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or	only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal	property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.	9.473483750502535
5200. another question that was asked of the assessors was whether	they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or	at the residence of the owner.	9.036413179024143
5201. eighteen voted for assessment by the	town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town	in which the owner resides.	9.330987905116682
5202. ten others made no reply.	20.896261181140837
5203. of those who	have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred.	12.215664980457547
5204. there	was one vote for location being the place where the property is	situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment	date.	10.47320570699619
5205. to summarize it may be said that there is no one	prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation	of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement	and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location	is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge.	12.616736660335135
5206. the need for	greater knowledge is evident from their replies.	19.56568520394587
5207. property	interest has been shown for a number	of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats.	8.885696171327579
5208. assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation	upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility	to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified	amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting.	8.84949847735501
5209. it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore	communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal	property which they have been unable to reach.	11.596047014653148
5210. through their	professional organization the rhode island tax officials association	the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed.	10.154642960660597
5211. no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the	difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence	on the part of the assessors.	13.422448540244933
5212. it has been estimated that	the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess	of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats.	13.409792306193987
5213. it is obvious that	this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors	of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be	subject to taxation.	10.904492959481363
5214. it is known that at least five towns	place some	value on some boats for tax purposes.	21.707049056183326
5215. however few are taxed and	the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on	the date of assessment of town valuations.	8.564559092185357
5216. no one really knows	how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may	be.	12.576454955179841
5217. slightly more than 5000 boats were registered with the coast guard	prior to the recent passage of the state boating law.	9.653331031089916
5218. only a few	more than 10000 boats had been registered with the division of harbors	and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had	been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought	the season to an early close.	12.490946971078515

5270. division	stated in its simplest terms the main job of the	planning division is to plan for the future of the state of rhode	island.	14.874106272679542
5271. the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable	detail in the enabling act of the development council which	assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties	in the field of planning.	9.092554251763076
5272. two years ago the institute of	public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled	state-local relations in metropolitan rhode island.	14.427790210364378
5273. as	the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in	this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the planning	division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused	a reorientation of its work program.	8.61913887460679
5274. these objectives are stated here	because of their importance in understanding the current activities	first priority will be given to	the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background	recognizing	the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration	that metropolian planning means or	should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account	the metropolitan nature of many of rhode island's problems.	8.94607744432202
5275. it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage	the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility	of local government.	14.923554820800216
5276. to this end the community assistance program	of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function	to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning	assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their	the planning division will take the initiative	in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government;	among the operating departments of the state; between the cities	and towns of the state; and on a regional basis between the six new	on the basis that all citizens of the state	are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources	plans for the provision of essential services will	be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within	the state development budget	will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority	of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan.	8.675777617803998
5277. particular attention will	be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the	development of industry and recreation.	10.465366218628407
5278. functionally the planning	division carries out four activities: long-range state planning	current state planning local planning assistance; and the preparation	of the state development budget.	8.951887347307554
5279. the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive	state planning program in the nation.	9.895514384076868
5280. the long range aspects of	this program are divided into four distinct phases: basic mapping	inventory analysis and plan and policy formation.	0.0
5281. the work program	as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete.	14.325543265282924
5282. recent	events- particularly the necessity of providing planning information	for the statewide origindestination study of the department	of public works- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated.	11.994229135750743
5283. the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and	basic	since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning	program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the	long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps-	one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile and the second a series of 26 sheets	at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet covering the entire state.	8.517423827965471
5284. with	these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started.	13.07239732400114
5285. with the aid of matching federal funds available	under section 701 of the housing act of 1954 as amended the planning	division began a one year program july 1 1960 to complete the inventory	phase of the state planning program.	9.074939436431688
5286. this phase consists of four	items: urban land use rural land use physical features and public	utility service areas.	10.940520249915352
5287. since the validity of all subsequent planning	depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care	is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.	10.318924836217091
5288. the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff	has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are	of significance to statewide planning.	9.522067756698938
5289. the rural land use study is	being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island	and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use.	9.45088898453539
5290. the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types	of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to	public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and	like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion	july 1 1961.	8.631089185400294
5291. the collection of information is meaningless	unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose.	10.246908001130082
5292. it is not within the scope of	this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in	rhode island.	15.485166051611552
5293. however a word should be mentioned in regard to them	as independent units of government.	12.275762710555778
5294. there are forty-seven special	district governments in rhode island	districts four housing authorities and the kent county water	.	14.628097469367564
5295. these forty-seven special purpose governments have the	authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued	and in general to exercise normal corporate powers.	7.79339641154825
5296. unlike cities	and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements	to the state bureau of audits.	13.577252315341639
5297. it is not an exaggeration to say	that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units	of government.	15.504835205947472
5298. in addition to the collection of service charges	the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450000.	17.62351739798804
5299. a	review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent	to this report.	8.834168570742513
5300. included in the findings are:  forty-six	states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june	30.	11.110676278631656
5301. the other four states end on varying dates: alabama	new york and texas	.	12.086041813787062
5302. in sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the	cities is the same as that of the state: alaska arizona	california delaware massachusetts montana nevada new mexico	north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon vermont	.	11.94661561734379
5303. in eleven states	the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 while the state fiscal	year ends on june 30	hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington	.	8.27094959889156
5304. in eight states whose fiscal years close	on june 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december	31:	.	11.173973651804753
5305. one state alabama closes	its fiscal year on september 30 and all cities in the state with	one exception also close fiscal years on september 30.	9.609377101765022
5306. mississippi closes its fiscal year on june 30 while all of its cities	close their fiscal years on september 30.	10.346885012448528
5307. pennsylvania closes	its fiscal year on may 31.	11.448263580594205
5308. all of its cities close their fiscal	years on december 31.	18.778555714645254
5309. the remaining twelve states have varying	fiscal years for the state city and local governments.	11.40642924468029
5310. however	only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation	in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal	uniformity.	9.959102447417672
5311. an excellent summary of advantages concerning	the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained	in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently.	8.173522097584627
5312. he listed	among the values of fiscal uniformity:  the uniform fiscal	year requires compliance with common sense administration of local	finances: adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending.	10.655356335226452
5313. the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another	common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks	are drawn.	8.674870936306482
5314. it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to	take advantage of cash discounts.	14.737749016381246
5315. the uniform fiscal year promotes	more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures.	10.61385277229228
5316. by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set	on expenditures.	11.863440179252054
5317. the uniform fiscal year brings the town's	fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest	share of local disbursements.	10.628766999452308
5318. this greatly simplifies the town's	bookkeeping and financial reporting.	15.63799501176316
5319. the uniform fiscal	year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax	anticipation notes.	11.88661005323072
5320. furthermore tax collections not immediately needed	for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes	augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax	levy.	9.148757032765333
5321. the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison	of revenues and expenditures.	11.572314230763848
5322. when towns have the same fiscal	year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons; and as the	cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also	increases.	11.842559443590948
5323. towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.	10.057988591011652
5324. of all advantages probably none is more important than	the elimination of tax anticipation notes.	15.172468724847844
5325. borrowing in anticipation	of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority	of municipalities at all times.	8.090791750569782
5326. it may be by bank loans sale	of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and	registration of warrants.	13.653409383596607
5327. in any event it is a form of borrowing which	could be and should be rendered unnecessary.	20.72546178093333
5328. its elimination would	result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates	are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always	available when needed most.	9.305372028091547
5329. this type of borrowing can be reduced	to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted	and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year.	9.791976853928146
5330. any	approach	toward such a system looks toward saving and security.	11.793662721363662
5331. it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons	for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform	fiscal year.	15.632109613164427
5332. both the federal and state governments commence their	fiscal years on july 1.	12.71911184964041
5333. both units of government contribute increasingly	large sums of money to the several local governments in this	state as indicated below:    it has been said that when local	government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property	tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap; but with	the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization	and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important	functions this is no longer true.	8.270965663024619
5334. the haphazard fiscal year calendar	is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local	revenue and expenditure relationships.	10.915042464758631
5335. although	there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal	years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered.	9.015453045322829
5336. these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal	uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle.	10.506758885717412
5337. one problem is a matter of shifting dates; the other is how to	finance the transition.	12.049591940293878
5338. little can be done about the changing	of dates.	18.678812910431585
5339. this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars.	19.015423106125663
5340. it	usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period	of time.	10.635267499930531
5341. but cooperation and understanding between local officials	and the citizenry help lessen this problem.	11.122832744970024
5342. the other problem	is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities	and towns.	14.096146654451879
5343. this will be covered more fully later.	20.503187814128925
5344. it should be kept	in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can	convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial	condition of that town or city.	12.21170452944192
5345. fortunately there are no cities or towns	in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too	difficult a position to finance the proposed change.	10.143376340121014
5346. sacrifice will	have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipality's advantage	to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than	pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely.	13.710745488874688
5347. fiscal calendars	the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well	synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great	for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them.	7.65221038034197
5348. the	type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent	of the adjustments needed.	11.810524393525808
5349. two features are immediately evident.	15.461937182626903
5350. first	the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single	formula.	11.224691946259922
5351. second the shift to a uniform july 1-june 30 fiscal year	will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great	majority of cities and towns.	8.178453122986443
5352. there are at least two problems to consider:	one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar; the other	is how to finance the adjustments when necessary.	15.207985151369792
5353. the latter matter	is considered in detail in a later section.	14.587837418384586
5354. twelve cities and	towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a	uniform andor coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar.	9.825092707759273
5355. plans vary from	the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish	this end.	9.070074471681158
5356. what is important here is that many of the cities and towns	recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the	initiative to obtain them.	14.936495449847854
5357. an analysis of the fiscal-tax collection	year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition	may not be as painful as is commonly thought.	9.22344765772652
5358. however it must be stressed	that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual	cities and towns involved.	14.044905726336813
5359. the adjustments needed to establish	a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout	rhode island based on a july 1-june 30 year are shown below.	8.672093939665313
5360. six cities and towns are presently on a	july 1-june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection	year with it.	10.108653554926697
5361. no change is required for these towns.	13.673640231008864
5362. these municipalities	include: barrington lincoln middletown newport north	kingstown and south kingstown.	12.821284994007588
5363. one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment	of their fiscal year only.	9.785626220226739
5364. this change will automatically adjust	their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments	due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year.	10.649162926965259
5365. six cities and towns are now	on a july 1-june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their	tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity.	8.05030179128445
5366. these cities and	towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central	falls and woonsocket.	12.289894396987272
5367. two cities	to be considered providence and cranston are an enigma.	10.890357443084502
5368. both have	excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars.	13.302749444177817
5369. however neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1-june	30 fiscal year.	11.089399990554593
5370. the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal	period could be accomplished relatively easy for them.	11.671338429154341
5371. in that	both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 they could levy taxes	for an interim period of nine months commencing with september	30 and ending with june 30.	8.179501964196987
5372. these three installment dates would be:	october 26 january 26 and april 25 and november	15 february 16 and may 15.	10.000667142840305
5373. both would start their new	fiscal year on july 1.	11.34498292004372
5374. their tax collection calendar could then be:	july 25 october 26 january 26 and april 25;	and august 15 november 15 february 17 and may 15.	9.125628809282283
5375. under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform	fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods.	9.955362292247683
5376. the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal	years which end prior to june 30.	12.445450562798397
5377. all of these towns will require	adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years.	12.89126389014681
5378. assuming	an adjustment to the july 1-june 30 fiscal year the required adjustment	of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table	3.	9.440119929828391
5379. aside from the matter	of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing	the adjustment when this is necessary.	12.496245426941488
5380. it should be emphasized	strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets	do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental	requirements.	13.495706864148126
5381. in many communities there is simply no financial	problem; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful	fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques.	10.63967897701305
5382. in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial	burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of	fiscal year changes.	12.141626521276917
5383. fortunately such cases in rhode island are more	the exception than the rule.	10.269954422798424
5384. as shown earlier in table 1	the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection	calendars.	12.190314372498245
5385. in addition no two rhode island communities are identical	in relation to their over-all financial condition.	12.105817657553946
5386. these factors	practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible; each	situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration	such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective	tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length	of the transition interval.	9.199793837578769
5387. suitable plans range from those that are	very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require	borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.	7.488789718559854
5388. the financial problem where it exists usually stems from	the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period.	11.003365555671996
5389. for	those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments	there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone	or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the	problem.	8.981752269222143
5390. governor	the theme of rhode island heritage week for 1961 will	be independence and union.	11.198755927126268
5391. it commemorates the 185th anniversary	of rhode island's independence when upon may 4 1776 the	general assembly by its action established the first free republic	in the new world.	8.79181545633643
5392. as this year marks the centennial of the	beginning of the civil war this fact is being commemorated with several	exhibits throughout the state but most of all paying tribute to	the first rhode island volunteers who rushed to the defense of the	city of washington putting at the disposal of president lincoln	the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.	9.886360074716771
5393. on april 30 ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers	will take place at 1:00 pm at the dexter training grounds	in providence.	9.506212386233173

5400. as the president has said only when our	arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never	be employed.	14.3825924948557
5401. armed forces day is the annual report on	this investment a public presentation designed to give our own people	and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom	and justice the best possible opportunity to see and understand what	we have and why we have it.	8.72178570233331
5402. it is the purpose of armed forces	day to give americans an opportunity to honor men of the armed	forces those who have made the supreme sacrifice those who remain	to preserve our security.	14.941733373503885
5403. freedom depends upon them; now therefore	do i john a notte jr governor of the state of rhode island	and providence plantations proclaim saturday may 20th 1961	as armed forces day reminding our citizens that we should rededicate	ourselves to our nation respecting the uniforms as the guardians	of our precious liberty.	7.789299768430814

5496. this consists of 25 individual	registries two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960	.	12.703079195189439
5497. these registries are sponsored by 18 national medical	dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling	of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing	through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural	history of various diseases of military-medical importance.	7.462581768081768
5498. the american	registry of pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in	medical research and education between the armed forces institute of	pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international	basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between	the national research council and the surgeons general of the army	navy and air force.	8.89468578115336
5499. the staff utilized the collected material	in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international	meetings exhibits and published studies.	9.123472978054563
5500. during the period of this	report 37470 new cases were entered into the various registries.	17.279923895061984
5501. these were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical	information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational	purposes.	8.764905824813761

5507. the clinico-pathologic conferences have been acknowledged	as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated	military hospitals.	8.828385447606417
5508. the demand for teaching sets continues unabated	since they provide the means for the military physicians to review	the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review	of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior	with structural changes.	9.682235059152609
5509. in fiscal year 1959	the medical museum was moved to chase hall a temporary building	on independence avenue at ninth street southwest and continued	to display to the public the achievements of the armed forces medical	services.	9.111372879343023
5510. during the period of this report 63 panel exhibits	depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed.	15.484813954674335

5521. during fiscal years 1959 and 1960 there were 795586 visitors to the	museum.	14.72260009859665
5522. during the period from 1 july 1960 through 31 january	1961 the medical museum was required to move to temporary building	s on the mall from chase hall.	11.203683154326765
5523. throughout the period	and during the movement operation the museum continued its functional	support of the armed forces institute of pathology.	10.70415596408133
5524. medical publication agency	the armed forces medical publication	agency established in 1949 has published since january 1950	the united states armed forces medical journal as a triservice	publication	to furnish material of professional interest to medical department	officers of the three military services.	8.681627513275375
5525. its supplement the medical	technicians bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted	medical personnel.	10.076599713307326
5526. these publications replaced the u s naval	medical bulletin published continuously from 1907 through 1959 as	well as the navy's hospital corps quarterly and the bulletin of	the u s army medical department published from 1922 to 1949.	10.024375225909312
5527. in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication	of a contemplated air force medical bulletin.	11.668003994223527
5528. estimated annual	savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin	on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate	periodicals for each service were between $65000 and $70000.	10.15868250820602
5529. additionally	on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations	the availability of the journal removed the necessity of subscribing	to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the	quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable	coverage.	8.236252740690663
5530. from 1 july 1958 to 30 june 1960 24 numbers of	the	journal and nine of the bulletin were published.	11.143726950041197
5531. each journal contained	articles of professional and clinical interest and departments	devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features	of interest to officers of the medical services.	8.249869890925037
5532. the council	on national defense of the american medical association contributed	a brief article to each issue entitled this is your ama.	12.1714360286022
5533. beginning with the october 1959 issue of the journal	the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was	changed from varityping to hot typesetting.	8.281933624601693
5534. this resulted in an improved	appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that	necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total	of allocated funds.	12.974390497035419
5535. the use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper	plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the may 1960 issue	reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with	nearly $4000 in unexpended funds.	8.810257465135086
5536. two special issues were	published one for november 1959 on space medicine the other the	tenth anniversary issue for january 1960.	9.976142095484157
5537. the february 1960 issue	marked the reinstitution of the section entitled the medical officer	writes.	10.242653103537407
5538. replacing the discontinued medical technicians	bulletin	publication of which was suspended with the november-december	1959 issue a section called technical notes was inaugurated	on a bimonthly basis beginning with the april 1960 issue.	9.137334975991187
5539. occasional	features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography	and collector's items.	9.345058977386529
5540. in may 1960 the armed	forces institute of pathology began a series of articles on the medical	museum and in june the institute started contributing	a regular monthly case for diagnosis.	11.10969055916474
5541. the institute also planned	to furnish a regular series of articles beginning in the fall	of 1960 on its more significant scientific exhibits.	8.719546626268006
5542. the armed	forces epidemiological board agreed to submit each month a report	for one of its 12 commissions so that each commission will report	once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest	and value to medical officers of the armed forces.	9.571422139835978
5543. the first	report in this continuing series appeared in the september 1960 issue	of the journal.	11.1981141247677
5544. another recent achievement was the successful development of a method	for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine	when the product is relatively non-volatile.	8.871723116700105
5545. this work gave a heat	of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value	which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this	property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago.	8.510521208596355
5546. similar measurements	are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the	heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride.	9.556508297210817
5547. the development and testing of new apparatus to measure	other properties is nearing completion.	10.242653103537407
5548. in one of these an exploding-wire	device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6000 f and	100 atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved.	14.168238333934077
5549. the accuracy of	measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during	a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison	with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2	percent.	7.763580852895066
5550. this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals.	14.074164469247409
5551. the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element	as a calorimeter.	13.907246854918583
5552. the element is inserted	in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire	and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy.	11.315499618780173
5553. this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and	the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the	element and the measured voltage across the element.	9.505677769940274
5554. a high-speed	shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation	of any portion of the electrical wire explosion.	12.647818222271685
5555. the shutter consists	of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part.	10.61385277229228
5556. using	edgerton's method the fast-closing action is obtained from the	blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires.	9.88711960874726
5557. the fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil	placed directly in front of the camera lens so that	no light may pass into the camera.	13.45828769288959
5558. the opening action is obtained	when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through	the foil.	11.443194842119574
5559. during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the	passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward	its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera.	9.303720359050864
5560. experiments	have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds.	10.358652090748608
5561. the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing	the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil.	8.753844336543663
5562. besides	the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectra of	extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic	of other atoms ions and small molecules.	8.777324869432913
5563. the detection and study	of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on	interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres.	8.674870936306482
5564. among the	most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light	diatomic hydrides oh and ch; somewhat less likely sources	are the heavier hydrides sh sih and sch.	9.489965894480786
5565. very small	concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar	gas concentrations as low as f moleculesf may be sufficient	as compared to the f hydrogen atoms f required for detection of	the 21-cm line.	8.194489980117554
5566. high sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved	by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore only with	precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical	search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible.	9.110362967906346
5567. to secure precise	measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical	microwave spectroscopy has been started.	9.486264779536949
5568. since conventional methods	are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions	the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead.	10.286598017570356
5569. this	involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor	which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave	range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity.	8.423206206384604
5570. the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance	method was the oh radical.	13.538773254924651
5571. results of this experiment include	the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which oh may	be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665.	7.979745365809826
5572. 36 f with an uncertainty of 0.	13.037321475654965
5573. success in observing these	spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory;	extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported.	9.004936901306678
5574. preparations	are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh	radicals.	11.33819267263277
5575. the bureau is pursuing	an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration	services in the range 1.	9.655307313944196
5576. the efforts and accomplishments	fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based	upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving	principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium-4	vapor-pressure measurements.	9.72630913200205
5577. an acoustical interferometer has been constructed and	used with helium gas as the thermometric fluid to measure temperatures	near 4.	8.631939789939143
5578. such an interferometer provides a means of absolute	temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to	the gas thermometer.	14.724431951364663
5579. when values of temperature derived with this instrument	were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid	helium-4 vapor pressures differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively	were found.	8.68666920215169
5580. this result is preliminary and work is continuing.	15.63799501176316
5581. carbon resistors and impurity-doped	germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary	thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region.	7.9139724503302755
5582. several	germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.	11.33819267263277
5583. 2 f and	their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 13 millidegree	when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer	whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.	9.40573121582749
5584. preliminary	calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.	15.762037432749858
5585. 16	f at every 0.	14.19641732877796
5586. the estimated standard deviations of the data for	two of the resistors were  1 millidegree; and for the third resistor	3.	12.421254966600701
5587. the reproducibilities	of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated	in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath	from 4.	9.189554574368655
5588. surface temperature gradients have been found to	exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter metallic storage	dewars.	10.453242053471664
5589. the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.	15.576934336384456
5590. 2	f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly	greater than the |l point.	10.11881746645696
5591. a hydrostatic head correction has	been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures	or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium.	8.378567509257149
5592. however the surface	temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements	for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate	the tube	from the liquid helium surface.	10.563994412741861
5593. it has also been observed in helium	2 that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures	and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer.	10.875112977008406
5594. this	has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer.	11.4183549799869
5595. in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified	pressure transducer for pvt	precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on	corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer.	10.203127596575628
5596. a prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and	thoroughly tested.	13.12566368285538
5597. the transducer is a null-type instrument and employs	a stretched diaphragm 0.	14.535362699867708
5598. 001 in thick and 1 in in diameter.	12.3482207866056
5599. a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance	between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced	0.	9.117041901984168
5600. spherical concave backing surfaces	support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent	the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit.	8.951887347307554
5601. over a temperature range from 25 to 200 f and at pressures up to	250 atm an overload of 300 psi applied for a period of one day	results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter	of mercury.	8.240738831007699
5602. a 6-year study of the	transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed.	11.339107725659472
5603. this project was carried out under sponsorship of the ballistic	missile division of the air research and development command us	air force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport	by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding.	9.11966609802401
5604. a significant	effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl	numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation	region.	12.42106264306339
5605. another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal	diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature	differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present.	7.9456769036960395
5606. the results of the study based on collision integrals computed from	the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air	will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity	thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures	of 1000 to 10000 f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from	f to f times normal density.	9.471164183398297
5607. in march 1961 representatives of the national laboratories	of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr	united states and west germany met at the nbs	to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature	scale between 10 and 90 f.	8.44564365821314
5608. as a first step toward this goal	arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through	circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers	for calibration by each national laboratory.	0.0
5609. such a group of thermometers	was obtained and calibrated at the nbs.	13.776486103427874

5653. mr speaker for several years now the commuter	railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly	difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population	wants and is entitled to have.	8.695523032299432
5654. the causes of the decline of the commuter	railroads are many and complex- high taxes losses of revenue to	government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two.	11.071642932935642
5655. and	the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally	varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete	discontinuance of this important service.	10.107019643309892
5656. there have been a number	of sound plans proposed.	32.743413601357
5657. but none of these has been implemented.	17.829496071494383
5658. instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service	decline and have failed to offer a helping hand.	12.255144128666917
5659. though the number	of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased	tremendously since world war 2 total annual rail commutation	dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957.	10.203339518584075
5660. nowhere has this decline	been more painfully evident than in the new york city area.	18.274039062442046
5661. here the	new york central railroad one of the nation's most important	carriers has alone lost 47.	7.8784449515893815
5662. 6 percent of its passengers since 1949.	13.707755784173429
5663. at this time of crisis in our nation's commuter railroads	a new threat to the continued operations of the new york central has	appeared in the form of the chesapeake + ohio railroad's proposal	for control of the baltimore + ohio railroads.	9.137536924196358
5664. the new york	central has pointed out that this control if approved by the interstate	commerce commission would give the combined c + o-b	+ o railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the	new york central.	10.399661818901178
5665. not only is this kind of duplication wasteful	but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic	away from the new york central and other railroads serving the area.	11.505155303651208
5666. the new york central notes:   the freight traffic	most susceptible to raiding by the c + o-b + o provides	the backbone of central's revenues.	11.612503816074305
5667. these revenues make it	possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire	new york central system as well as the new york area commuter	and terminal freight services.	9.542549446588117
5668. if these services are to be maintained	the new york central must have the revenues to make them possible.	14.516367635189226
5669. the new york central today handles 60 percent of all	southbound commuter traffic coming into new york city.	11.542157019986371
5670. this is a	$14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work on commuter	traffic exclusively.	15.5513439616328
5671. a blow to this phase of the central's operations	would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad	itself but to the 40000 people per day who are provided with efficient	reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city.	10.207682438188849
5672. there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful	c + o-b + o merger scheme-   the central	has pointed out.	14.444525071470226
5673. the logic of creating a strong balanced	competitive two-system railroad service in the east is so obvious	that b + o was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.	8.603475303129162
5674. detailed studies of the plan were well underway.	14.04466177404513
5675. though	far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings	would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads	concerned their investors their customers their users and to the	public at large.	7.825112486782558
5676. then abandoning the studies in the face of	their promising outlook for all concerned b + o entered on-again-off-again	negotiations with c + o which resulted in the present	situation.	11.006040255989118
5677. in the light of the facts at hand however	new york central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create	a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest.	11.058495795288033
5678. the interstate commerce commission will commence its	deliberations on the proposed c + o-b + o merger on	june 18.	11.428867987025209
5679. obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force	the new york central to further curtail its commuter operations	by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge.	8.336008171167814
5680. however there is a more profound consideration to this proposed	merger than profit and loss.	17.220284003045737
5681. that is will it serve the long-range	public interest?	16.97181135091233
5682.    for the past 40 years congress has advocated	a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system.	14.238446543706159
5683. we must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter-	the two-way b + o-c + o merger or the three-way	new york central-b + o-c + o merger.	8.970931949416315
5684. which will	serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests	of all the traveling public?	12.627541919443889
5685. 	mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to	a great newspaper the new york times on the occasion of a major change	in its top executive command.	8.566649462704076
5686. arthur hays sulzberger has	been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and	it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to american	journalism on the occasion of his retirement.	9.165599910214274
5687. i am pleased to	note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the	board of the new york times.	15.282211792120782
5688. mr sulzberger's successor	as publisher is mr orvil e dryfoos who is president of the	new york times co and who has been with the times since 1942.	10.804203151191642
5689. mr dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that	the high standards which have made the times one of the world's	great newspapers will be maintained.	9.655614304610534
5690. i am also pleased to note	that mr john b oakes a member of the times staff since 1946	has been appointed as editorial page editor.	15.307278860324704
5691. mr oakes succeeds	charles merz editor since 1938 who now becomes editor emeritus.	10.340309910324555
5692. i should like at this time mr speaker to pay warm tribute	to arthur hays sulzberger and charles merz on the occasion of	their retirement from distinguished careers in american journalism.	11.529414042945307
5693. my heartiest congratulations go to their successors orvil e	dryfoos and john b oakes who can be counted upon to sustain	the illustrious tradition of the new york times.	9.318388516296405
5694. the people	of the 17th district of new york and i as their representative	in congress take great pride in the new york times as one of the	great and authoritative newspapers of the world.	13.270955469905296
5695. mr speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents	i urged the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba as the	only effective method of preventing continued soviet armaments from	coming into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine.	8.224705416891295
5696. yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article	in the us news + world report of may 8 which discussed this	type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its	disadvantages.	9.56679710131411
5697. under leave to extend my remarks i include	the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the	article from the us news + world report:	cuban ssr: whatever may have been the setbacks resulting	from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish	a beachhead on the castro-held mainland last week there was at least	one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the	whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian-dominated	military base.	8.04844523620475
5698. in fact one of the major reasons for the	failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full	information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian	military equipment.	13.474588454421793
5699. somehow the pictures and stories of soviet	t-34 tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing	rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth	of what it means to have a russian military base 90 miles away from	home.	7.979038841081401
5700. russian tanks and planes in cuba jeopardize the security of	the united states violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the	security of every other latin american republic.	9.980269089171317
5701. once the full	extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president	kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate	to prevent this even if we had to go it alone.	8.873164254664657
5702. but the latin american	republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on	taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally	throwing cuba off the inter-american defense board.	10.358551322127868
5703. for years	the united states had been trying to get these countries to exclude	castro's representative from secret military talks.	10.753902183166035
5704. but it took the	pictures of the migs and the t-34 tanks to do the job.	17.036565190594285
5705. there	is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week.	14.882043094517321
5706. you can see	it for example in the extensive efforts president kennedy has made	to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both cuba	and laos; efforts	as i see it which are being directed by the way toward	support for future actions not for those already past.	11.60253894737809
5707. what	the next move will be only time of course will tell.	11.193494880625234
5708. personally	i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba.	13.243620284839176
5709. we	simply can't tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility	of long-range nuclear missiles being located in cuba.	8.29272515769823
5710. obviously	we can't stop them from coming in however just by talk.	11.40140436798428
5711. a naval	blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe doctrine would	be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an	abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere.	8.340472838649054
5712. us news + world report may 8 1961	_next for cuba:	look at castro now- cockier than ever	with arms and agents to threaten the americas.	9.331129098186077
5713. how can the	united states act?	21.482841787422455
5714.    blockade is one answer offered by experts.	13.037321475654965
5715. in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish	castro too.	12.932304675135269
5716. this is the question now facing president	kennedy: how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to	communist infiltration of this hemisphere?	13.831064818763778
5717.    on april 25 the	white house reported that a total embargo of remaining us	trade with cuba was being considered.	9.7248197880646
5718. its aim: to undermine further	cuba's economy.	15.580704863063778
5719. another strategy- bolder	and tougher- was also attracting notice in washington: a naval	and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro.	8.133651576797742
5720. blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore	teeth to the monroe doctrine.	12.249083702843
5721. it could halt a flood of communist	arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro.	14.669050101869212
5722. it could stop	cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to south america.	17.250540574617315
5723. it would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the	united states could invoke against castro.	15.99768990534016
5724. it is the strategy	of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention	of administration officials members of congress officers in the	pentagon.	19.03884203744817
5725. as a possible course of action it also is the center of	what	would	military experts say a tight naval blockade	off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require	two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with	a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.	8.119528243968581
5726. the	navy on april 25 announced it is bringing back the carrier shangri-la	from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of	attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba.	9.055663798857585
5727. more than 36 other big navy	ships are no less than a day's sailing time away.	14.168625946370629
5728. to round	out the blockading force submarines would be needed- to locate identify	and track approaching vessels.	11.415599337012134
5729. land-based radar would help with	this task.	11.867291106449708
5730. so would radar picket ships.	19.854575619435728
5731. a squadron of navy jets and	another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier	task forces.	9.858402226093215
5732. three requirements go with a blockade: it must	be proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce	it; and it must be enforced without discrimination.	9.68895973822762
5733. once	these conditions of international law are met countries that try to	run to blockade do so at their own risk.	8.371855806525978
5734. blockade runners can be stopped-	by gunfire if necessary- searched and held at least temporarily.	10.11881746645696
5735. they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo	should be confiscated.	14.132601838237889
5736. in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe	doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere.	14.073634441772024
5737. it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war	strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.	13.92720083914537
5738. primary target	would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition	coming from russia and czechoslovakia.	10.049202209612254
5739. shipments of arms from western	countries could similarly be seized as contraband.	9.345058977386529
5740. in a total blockade	action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals	oils textiles and even foodstuffs.	13.63384937002246
5741. at times three ships a day from	the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports.	11.8011661796238
5742. from its inception in 1920 with the passage of public law 236 66th	congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been	to assist the states by means of grants-in-aid to return disabled	men and women to productive gainful employment.	10.820379861670501
5743. the authority for	the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation	program was made permanent as title 5 of the social security	act in 1935.	8.649548345931608
5744. up to this time and for the next eight years the services	provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling	and placement on a job.	13.450807603118365
5745. recognizing the limitations of such a program	the 78th congress in 1943 passed p l 113 which broadened	the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical	restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised	the financing structure.	8.049298398081238
5746. despite the successful	rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first	eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be	inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million	disabled.	10.253444284768515
5747. to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped	individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative	employment to the extent of their capabilities the 83rd	congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of 1954	.	9.355849127292075
5748. these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation	act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation	facilities for more sheltered and half-way workshops for	greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive	services to individuals	and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's	overall effectiveness.	8.78750676573639
5749. under the law as it	existed until 1943 the federal government made grants to the states	on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a 50-50	basis.	10.913127699597203
5750. under p l 113 78th congress the federal government	assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary state expenditures	in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of	the disabled and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients	with rehabilitation case services.	8.760165467012243
5751. throughout these years the statutory	authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out	the provisions of the act.	9.102792259180145
5752. the 1954 amendments completely changed	the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing	for a three-part grant structure- for extension	and improvement; and research demonstrations training and	traineeships for vocational rehabilitation- and in addition for	short-term training and instruction.	9.474452089955026
5753. the first part of the new structure-	that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation	services- is described in this section.	11.729707164667401
5754. subsequent sections	on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure.	11.606406736831968
5755. the following table shows for selected years the authorizations	appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state	matching funds for this part of the grant program:	distributing funds	in order to assist	the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section	2 of the amended act provides that allotments to states for	support of such services be based on need as measured by a state's	population and fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita	income.	8.035779780451946
5756. the act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment	set at the 1954 level which is called the base allotment	and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state.	9.453055163142391
5757. it stipulates	in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing	the ceiling	and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed	to those states still below their maximums.	10.670795245978685
5758. these provisions	are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among	the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person	have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in	a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly	populated state.	8.532733986004093
5759. the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption	in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result	from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population	alone.	8.759311799184614
5760. the method used in computing	the allotments is specifically set forth in the act.	14.642697855833415
5761. the term	state means the several states the district of columbia the	virgin islands guam and puerto rico; the term united states	includes the several states and the district of columbia and	excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior	to	1962 alaska and hawaii.	7.493527757330775
5762. the following steps are employed in calculations:	for each state	determine	average per capita income based on the last three years.	13.822549704506827
5763. determine the average per capita income for the u s	based on the last three years.	9.89327598741565
5764. determine	the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the u s	determine	for each state	that percentage which	bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular state's average per	capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u s.	9.429975562502047
5765. determine the particular	state's allotment percentage.	13.46545837823176
5766. by law this is 75% for	the virgin islands guam and puerto rico.	12.036982333027265
5767. in all other states it is the difference obtained by subtracting	from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above; except that no	state shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-13% nor more	than 75%.	9.017948690864914
5768. if the resulting difference for the particular state is	less or more than these extremes the state's allotment percentage	must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.	10.523207142376283
5769. square	each state's allotment percentage.	14.19641732877796
5770. multiply the population of each	state by the square of its allotment percentage.	12.694700013034515
5771. determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the	states.	12.253529150076451
5772. 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each state in item	determine the ratio that the amount being allotted	is to the sum of the products for all the states.	12.139083445759365
5773. determine	the particular state's unadjusted allotment for the particular	fiscal year.	10.057988591011652
5774. determine if the particular	state's unadjusted allotment	is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted	allotment to its maximum allotment.	9.204594541311614
5775. for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described	in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times	the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23000000	determine if	the particular state's unadjusted allotment	is less than its minimum allotment and if so raise	its unadjusted	allotment to its minimum allotment.	7.241258880974982
5776. regardless of its unadjusted	allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment	each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954-	increased by a uniform percentage of 5.	9.95444201798498
5777. 4865771 which brings total	1954 allotments to all states up to $23000000.	9.345058977386529
5778. the funds	recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used: first to increase	the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states	where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment	; and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those	states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments	to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum.	8.151452003315745
5779. for the states which maintain	two separate agencies- one for the vocational rehabilitation of	the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the	blind- the act specifies that their minimum allotment shall	be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided	in fiscal year 1954.	9.30597395306136
5780. funds allotted in addition to their minimum	allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine.	11.200074597634769
5781. as	is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational	rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on	a statutory formula.	8.559198387484596
5782. prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for	the minimum allotment state funds had to equal 1954 state funds.	11.73595843132722
5783. prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched	at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot	of 40% state participation in total program	costs.	11.274329745485025
5784. the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any	state is referred to in the law as that state's federal share.	12.73502454301844
5785. for purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to	as the states unadjusted federal share.	9.93624279709495
5786. beginning in 1960 the	matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted	25% a year so that by 1963 the entire	support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot state	share with maximum and minimum state shares of 50% and 30% respectively.	8.788457445787696
5787. the pre-1960 rate of federal participation with respect	to any state's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect	during the 1960-1962 period is designated by the statute as that	state's adjusted federal share.	8.468860307301108
5788. the provisions for determining	a state's unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the	varying financial resources among the states.	11.555214117185374
5789. the purpose of the adjusted	federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition	provisions	for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent	method of computing	the method used for computing the respective	federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set	forth in the act.	8.45440102251321
5790. the term state means the several states	the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico;	the term united states includes the several states and	the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam	and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii.	8.490244807535843
5791. the following	steps are employed in the calculations:  for each state	determine the average per capita income for	the last three years.	8.828385447606417
5792. determine the average	per capita income for the united states for the last three years.	18.293290639721278
5793. same amount used in item 2 under method of computing allotments	determine the ratio of 40% to the average per	capita income of the united states.	9.062544843413813
5794. determine for each state		that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular	state's average per capita income bears to the average per	capita income of the united states.	9.747386709054068
5795. determine the particular state's federal share.	12.376656064195576
5796. by	law this is 70% for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico.	10.635267499930531
5797. in all other states it is the difference	obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4	above; except	that no state shall have a federal share less than	50% nor more than 70%.	9.129413826977089
5798. if the resulting difference for the particular	state is less or more than these extremes the state's federal	share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.	10.523207142376283
5799. at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested	on the inside 4 inches of the block wall.	12.339998269915275
5800. the outside 4-inch space is	filled by mortaring blocks on edge.	14.372902938789263
5801. the wooden bracing between the roof	beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall.	12.348049347545173
5802. mortar is poured	between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the	wall thickness for radiation shielding.	9.412054727957594
5803. the first one or two roof boards	are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside	the shelter.	11.206904706021351
5804. these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up	through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter.	10.65812633756548
5805. concrete	blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards.	10.008853968349761
5806. the	roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together.	11.61251669513205
5807. work on the roof continues in this way.	17.93090701348661
5808. the last roof boards are covered	with blocks from outside the shelter.	15.019529853689983
5809. when the roof blocks	are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position.	11.203493754399659
5810. building plans are	on page 21.	15.068811854765874
5811. solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense	are used for this shelter.	9.47672194126632
5812. these blocks are sold in various sizes	so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit.	11.41146346166163
5813. solid blocks	are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete	to give effective protection.	12.253182260041314
5814. if they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give	the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks.	14.089857553937915
5815. the	illustrations in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall.	9.517896601517975
5816. more	detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply	houses and craftsmen.	10.635267499930531
5817. other sources of information include the national	concrete masonry association 38 south dearborn street	chicago ill the portland cement association 33 west grand	avenue chicago ill and the structural clay products association	washington dc.	7.416997471078958
5818. an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete	blocks.	13.238298110776684
5819. most people would	have to hire a contractor to build this shelter.	11.732709775217158
5820. plans are on pages	22 and 23.	13.915190642667962
5821. this shelter could be built in regions where water	or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground	shelter.	10.94503319361734
5822. two walls of concrete blocks are constructed	at least 20 inches apart.	12.243711475928587
5823. the space between them is filled with pit-run	gravel or earth.	11.572314230763848
5824. the walls are held together with metal ties placed	in the wet mortar as the walls are built.	11.749988135922983
5825. the roof shown here	is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete covered with at	least 20 inches of pit-run gravel.	9.49264199883336
5826. an alternate roof perhaps more	within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof	beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing.	9.947670287615844
5827. it would have to be covered	with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel.	22.308761309602946
5828. the materials	for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700.	14.310793878502059
5829. contractors' charges	would be additional.	14.19641732877796
5830. the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout	protection.	16.386222825564015
5831. pre-shaped corrugated	metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either	above or below ground.	11.020932966818453
5832. these are particularly suitable for regions where	water or rock is close to the surface.	15.135573023435626
5833. they form effective fallout	shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure 10.	12.284259624616428
5834. materials for this shelter would cost about $700.	12.3482207866056
5835. a contractor probably	would be required to help build it.	12.655764899046629
5836. his charges would be added to	the cost of materials.	13.11972343880311
5837. this shelter as shown on page 24 would provide	almost absolute protection from fallout radiation.	10.101285660705964
5838. an alternate	hatchway entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials	$50 to $100.	11.893279583671644
5839. the national lumber manufacturers association	washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially	treated lumber for underground shelter construction.	9.549986384423683
5840. the structural	clay products institute washington dc is working to develop	underground	an underground reinforced concrete shelter	can be built by a contractor for about $1000 to $1500 depending	on the type of entrance.	10.046455101399992
5841. the shelter shown would provide almost absolute	fallout protection.	12.98623016976681
5842. the illustration shows this	shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over.	12.010194183656237
5843. the same shelter	could be built into an embankment or below ground level.	11.872547400905466
5844. plans	for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown	on pages 26 and 27.	9.723773562266802
5845. another type of shelter which gives excellent	fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement	of a home under construction.	9.295313130225562
5846. it would add about $500 to the total	cost of the home.	19.882880135522665
5847. the shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such	a room built in a new home in the washington dc area in the	spring of 1959.	11.572579455627626
5848. common	to each type of shelter are:  arrangement of the entrance.	12.179703636701324
5849. must have at least one right-angle turn.	18.11612891063498
5850. radiation scatters somewhat like light.	15.068811854765874
5851. some will go around a corner.	14.545311138544532
5852. the rest continues in a straight line.	18.292460757857103
5853. therefore sharp turns	in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter.	9.394451199360734
5854. is provided in a concrete block basement	shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance.	13.847484620298015
5855. a blower	may be installed to increase comfort.	13.395765942259846
5856. a blower is essential	for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters.	13.779737390339983
5857. it should	provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person.	13.12357666850652
5858. vent	pipes also are necessary but	filters are not.	13.037321475654965
5859. is cut down by the	shielding necessary to keep out radiation.	12.138661625646428
5860. as soon as the shelter is	completed a radio reception check must be made.	17.57669264436071
5861. it probably will be	necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad	broadcasts.	12.09254085852554
5862. continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the	shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere	flashlight-type bulb.	10.42648949891715
5863. tests have shown that such a device	with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least	10 days.	8.678901824196904
5864. with a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more	would be assured.	14.6305864037142
5865. a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available	for those periods when a brighter light is needed.	9.351955910568863
5866. there should	be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue	in many areas.	13.438484526484014
5867. if there	are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter	they should be shielded as shown in the appendix page 29.	11.077311570467865
5868. other basement	windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens.	12.957194890040192
5869. basement	walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the	appendix page 29.	10.050851074074574
5870. in these shelters the entrance should be	not more than 2 feet wide.	15.97491580446844
5871. bunks or materials to build them may have	to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed.	8.166228200570187
5872. the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado	or hurricane protection.	12.445450562798397
5873. the	radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first.	11.118618003375188
5874. forty-nine hours	after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent	of what it was an hour after the explosion.	9.922140392592352
5875. but the radiation may	be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous.	12.579678912663441
5876. therefore civil defense instructions received over conelrad	or by other means should be followed.	11.015620856498392
5877. a battery-powered	radio is essential.	18.34168694583862
5878. radiation instruments suitable for home use are	available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home	which offers the best protection against fallout radiation.	11.155597873565158
5879. there is	a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters	may become available.	13.147953068783316
5880. one instrument thus would serve both purposes.	17.615700666707628
5881. your local civil defense will gather its own information and	will receive broad information from state and federal sources.	8.893757339978972
5882. it	will tell you as soon as possible:   how long to stay in your	shelter.	13.365955789742959
5883. how soon you may go outdoors.	15.332896408532532
5884. how long you	may stay outside.	21.045855440501583
5885. you should be prepared to stay in your shelter	full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14	days or longer.	12.943850477287251
5886. a checklist in the appendix tells what is	needed.	14.647991031386455
5887. families with children will have particular problems.	14.371897095366824
5888. they	should provide for simple recreation.	15.068811854765874
5889. there should be a task	for everyone and these tasks should be rotated.	19.371055974023196
5890. part of the family should	be sleeping while the rest is awake.	28.53070592250698
5891. to break the monotony	it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy.	10.998398447997491
5892. records such as diaries can be kept.	13.472041276775048
5893. the survival of the family	will depend largely on information received by radio.	12.938783063703605
5894. a record should	be kept of the information and instructions including the time and	date of broadcast.	11.471009452944916
5895. family rationing probably will be necessary.	15.680739612173873
5896. blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule.	12.236716858040163
5897. there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation	has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement.	15.194599442386382
5898. however as	much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation	exposure to a minimum.	10.740735629072274
5899. the housekeeping problems of living	in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied.	11.625512872537108
5900. food medical	supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the	shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it.	9.317720268463072
5901. after	the family has settled in the shelter the housekeeping rules should	be spelled out by the adult in charge.	8.082367128027338
5902. sanitation in the confines	of the family shelter will require much thought and planning.	10.358652090748608
5903. provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human	wastes will be an unfamiliar problem.	9.378399679698203
5904. a covered container such as a kitchen	garbage pail might do as a toilet.	12.961848137953165
5905. a 10-gallon garbage can with	a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it	is safe to leave the shelter.	11.838448785669494
5906. water rationing will be difficult	and should be planned carefully.	14.031964115410089
5907. a portable electric heater	is advisable for shelters in cold climates.	11.516492904103949
5908. it would take the chill from	the shelter in the beginning.	25.511769805147683
5909. even if the electric power fails after	an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter	that much more comfortable.	10.890122593186716
5910. body heat in the close quarters will	help keep up the temperature.	10.957705180640192
5911. warm clothing and bedding of course	are essential.	11.118618003375188
5912. open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided.	13.037321475654965
5913. a flame would use up air.	14.566660921827188
5914. some families already have held	weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to	determine for themselves what supplies they would need.	10.057931786217031
5915. an attack finds you without a prepared shelter	few areas if any	are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about.	9.30507353824616
5916. a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding	from fallout radiation.	12.589811652562057
5917. on the ground floor the radiation would	be about half what it is outside.	19.84918981377598
5918. the best protection would be on	the ground floor in the central part of the house.	15.690984136666438
5919. a belowground	basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside	level.	10.238518070264613
5920. the safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows	and deepest below ground.	11.636095537390238
5921. if there is time after the warning	the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking	windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material.	11.877753862309392
5922. large apartment buildings	of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual	family dwellings.	10.284069625400775
5923. in general such apartments afford more protection	than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is	more space.	10.24939232288813
5924. the central area of the ground floor of a heavily	constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide	more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling.	11.65548334397526
5925. the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural	protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended	for the basement of a family dwelling.	8.786459635108981
5926. the federal	government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential	commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout	protection they would provide and for how many people.	10.081336928612803
5927. the	problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use	of existing space.	10.538228628536329
5928. such planning will require the cooperation of other	occupants and of the apartment management.	14.225349254636097
5929. a former du pont official became a general motors vice president	and set about maximizing du pont's share of the general motors	market.	9.694393284527111
5930. lines of communications were established between the two	companies and several du pont products were actively promoted.	9.936682898094263
5931. within	a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire	requirements of from four to seven of general motors' eight operating	divisions.	8.102912449005771
5932. the fisher body division long controlled by the	fisher brothers under a voting trust even though general motors owned	a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years	but by 1947 and 1948 resistance had collapsed and its purchases	from du pont compared favorably with purchases by other general	motors divisions.	8.241954020466393
5933. competitors came to receive higher percentage	of general motors business in later years but it is likely	that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general	motors outstripping du pont's capacity.	10.38111235512468
5934. the fact	that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du pont's	production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements	of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont	by a stock interest.	10.39792778275641
5935. the inference is overwhelming that du pont's	commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained	solely on competitive merit.	9.426462240452924
5936. 353 u s at 605.	15.068811854765874
5937. this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price	quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general	motors.	8.51373500565124
5938. 353 u s at 606.	15.068811854765874
5939. however it determined that	neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive	posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the	honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own	company and without any design to overreach anyone including du pont's	competitors 353 u s at 607 outweighed the government's	claim for relief.	8.267061450763965
5940. this claim as submitted to the district	court and dismissed by it 126 fsupp235 alleged violation	not only of  7 of the clayton act but also of   1 and 2 of	the sherman act.	9.858489165676556
5941. the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination	or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and	monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize	such trade.	8.635418435660345
5942. however this court put to one side without consideration	the government's appeal from the dismissal of its sherman	act allegations.	13.29998788862922
5943. it rested its decision solely on  7 which reads	in pertinent part:   no corporation engaged in commerce	shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of	the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in	commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially	lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired	and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce	in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any	line of commerce.	7.298321437865897
5944. this section shall not apply to corporations	purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same	by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about	the substantial lessening of competition h.	9.242603668562717
5945. the purpose	of this provision was thus explained in the court's opinion:	section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only	the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation	of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation	but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies	in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the	time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation	of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation.	7.993351860935518
5946. the section	is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial	lessening of competition have occurred or are intended h.	10.847318835526345
5947. 353 u s at 589.	12.851133807717682
5948. thus a finding of conspiracy to	restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the court's	decision.	11.216082767757548
5949. indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption	that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont	and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised	their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests	of their own companies.	7.408343833141947
5950. this however did not bar finding that du	pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and	finishes to general motors; that these products constituted a line	of commerce within the meaning of the clayton act; that general	motors' share of the market for these products was substantial;	and that competition for this share of the market was endangered	by the financial relationship between the two concerns:   the	statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered	when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition	of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned	by the statute.	9.132243731122273
5951. we repeat that the test of a violation of  7 is	whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that	the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints.	11.43041329194725
5952. the	conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved	as to this acquisition h.	10.188173486419053
5953. 353 u s at 607.	12.851133807717682
5954. on	the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the court remanded	the case to the district court to determine the appropriate	relief.	12.701915154497947
5955. the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed	to it was this:   the judgment must therefore be reversed	and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination	after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate	in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition	offensive to the statute.	7.424871137263504
5956. the district courts in the framing	of equitable decrees are clothed 'with large discretion to model	their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case'.	10.149796784726894
5957. international	salt co	v united states 332 u s 392	400-401.	10.530932308755343
5958. 353 u s at 607-608.	15.068811854765874
5959. this brings us to the	course of the proceedings in the district court.	14.81066287596369
5960. this	court's judgment was filed in the district court on july 18	1957.	12.363706091647037
5961. the first pretrial conference- held to appoint amici curiae	to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general	motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent	hearings- took place on september 25 1957.	8.259624843185112
5962. at the outset the	government's spokesman explained that counsel for the government	and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view	to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court.	10.6662080658619
5963. du pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its general	motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont-general	motors relationship.	8.420428627674902
5964. the government deeming these suggestions inadequate	had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du pont's	shares of general motors.	11.635943650809462
5965. counsel for the government invited	du pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program	but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont	thought further discussion would not be profitable the government	was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days.	7.7495992008110886
5966. counsel for	du pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by	both sides at an early date.	10.548248288235246
5967. no previous antitrust case he said had	involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems	of relief.	9.08533028224275
5968. the submission of detailed plans would place the issues	before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture	or disenfranchisement in the abstract.	9.861026361047744
5969. the court adopted this procedure	with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.	11.249858121504476
5970. the	government submitted its proposed decree on october 25 1957.	11.793662721363662
5971. the	plan called for divestiture by du pont of its 63000000 shares of general	motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders	as a dividend over a period of ten years.	8.346592520257799
5972. christiana securities company	and delaware realty + investment company major stockholders	in du pont and the stockholders of delaware were dealt with specially	by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee again over	a ten-year period of du pont's general motors stock allocable to	them as well as any general motors stock which christiana and delaware	owned outright.	8.148284135272347
5973. if in the trustee's judgment reasonable	market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to	be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the	ten-year period.	9.065334719689972
5974. in addition the right to vote the general motors	stock held by du pont was to be vested in du pont's stockholders	other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware;	du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring	stock in or exercising control over general motors; du pont	christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director	or officer in common with general motors and vice versa; and	general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement	that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified	percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product	or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general	motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any	chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any	joint commercial enterprise by the two companies.	9.015011694072749
5975. on motion of	the amici	curiae the court directed that a ruling be obtained from	the commissioner of internal revenue as to the federal income tax	consequences of the government's plan.	8.947779578724473
5976. on may 9 1958 the commissioner	announced his rulings.	20.830914874949087
5977. the annual dividends paid to du pont	stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary	income to the extent of du pont's earnings and profits.	9.665343753073625
5978. the	measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual	stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time	of each annual distribution.	10.55009558047057
5979. in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders	the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value	of the shares or du pont's tax basis for them which is approximately	$2.	11.43022065201815
5980. the forced sale of the general motors stock owned	by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of	delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those	parties at the capital gains rate.	9.336564421357682
5981. du pont's counterproposal	was filed on may 14 1958.	10.530932308755343
5982. under its plan du pont would retain	its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders	the right to vote those shares.	10.491378925182307
5983. christiana and delaware would	in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors	shares allocable to them to their own stockholders.	9.073608583513076
5984. du pont would	be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone	who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and	no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director	of general motors without court approval.	8.590219495695113
5985. du pont would be denied	the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except	through general motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights	to its stockholders.	7.576307155387862
5986. on june 6 1958 general motors submitted	its objections to the government's proposal.	13.923040828720318
5987. it argued inter	alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market	value of the stock of both general motors and du pont with consequent	serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent	investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions;	that there would be a similar decline in the market values of	other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders	of those companies; that the tremendous volume of general	motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts	of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise	equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect	on the entire stock market and on general business activity.	7.4011322107714514
5988. general	motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would	not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this	court.	11.992465099572996
5989. the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed	in august of 1958.	10.61385277229228
5990. these plans like du pont's contained provisions	for passing the vote on du pont's general motors shares on	to the ultimate stockholders of du pont christiana and delaware	except that officers and directors of the three companies their spouses	and other people living in their households as well as other specified	persons were to be totally disenfranchised.	9.652835661394754
5991. both plans also prohibited	common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana	and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the	other.	10.237997836203524
5992. it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense	to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such	a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger	the confidentiality of the marriage relationship.	12.500137184848692
5993. while it is easy	enough to ridicule hawkins' pronouncement in pleas of the crown	from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness	of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between	husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be	regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage.	8.533813192928882
5994. by	making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which	congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today	continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt	v united states 362 us 525 where the court held that	under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to	testify against her husband over her objection.	8.181112349045975
5995. one need not waver in	his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other	things in american life which are also of great importance and to which	even law enforcement must accommodate itself.	8.33679476614116
5996. one of these is the	solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage.	21.35934006449195
5997. the court's	opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine	does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine	enthrones an unreality into a rule of law.	7.9194897122132115
5998. i am not	easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries	can be so lightly dismissed.	13.176729684209526
5999. but in any event i submit that	the power to depose belongs to congress not to this court.	12.2985070892661
6000. petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted	of violating  12 of the universal military training and service	act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces.	9.483636604129078
6001. he claims	that he was denied due process of law in violation of the fifth amendment	because at a hearing before a hearing officer of the department	of justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed	to him by the local board and at the trial he was denied the right	to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of	the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim.	8.698475091892858

6013. the court of appeals affirmed.	28.133849091539645
6014. we granted certiorari in view of the importance of	the questions in the administration of the act.	17.98784913013346
6015. we have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale	of gonzales v united states 348 us 407		and united states v nugent 346 us 1	and therefore affirm the judgment.	8.616475584587207
6016. petitioner registered with	local board no 9 boulder colorado on march 17 1952.	10.635267499930531
6017. his	answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a	minister of jehovah's witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer.	9.11266620561054
6018. he claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion	devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching.	12.449495173396619
6019. on november	13 1952 he was classified in class 1-a.	14.340333782216247
6020. on november 22	1952 he wrote the board protesting this classification.	17.111647983976454
6021. he again stated	that he was a regular minister; that he was devoting	an average	of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to	50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in	any form.	8.699480064993272
6022. thereafter he was classified 1-o.	16.924785458084283
6023. on april 1 1953	after some six months of full-time pioneering petitioner discontinued	devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so	notify his local board.	8.896704076971135
6024. in a periodic review the local board on july	30 1953 reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification	after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness	to kill in defense of his church and home.	11.21626892404987
6025. upon administrative approval	of the reclassification he was ordered to report for induction on	june 11 1956 but failed to do so.	9.474773867270354
6026. he was not prosecuted however	and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella	v united states 348 us 385.	15.02578183737466
6027. he was again	reclassified 1-a by the local board.	17.03142404087202
6028. there followed a customary	department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared.	16.711785679905248
6029. in	his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that	the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service.	8.96148244585451
6030. on march 21 1957 however the department recommended approval of	the 1-a classification.	14.669560460890358
6031. its ground for this recommendation was	that while petitioner claimed before the local board august 17 1956	that he	was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters	of the jehovah's witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so	and on the contrary had relinquished both his pioneer and bible	student servant positions.	7.5074064250049535
6032. it reported that he now devoted only some	6-12 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per	month to church activities.	11.67469951003603
6033. his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated	the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his	veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith.	8.330312204375788
6034. the	appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation.	13.633467343793598
6035. in	his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement	in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to pioneering	was in 1952.	8.705729985553479
6036. the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the	department's recommendation.	15.239017861002042
6037. upon return of the file to the local	board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this	prosecution followed his failure to do so.	9.319640208927485
6038. petitioner first contends	that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving	him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal	board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim	of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching.	9.328207214832561
6039. but the statement of the	local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file.	12.540506396465574
6040. he	admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have	rebutted it before the hearing officer.	13.218834936103244
6041. this he failed to do asserting	that he did not know it to be in his file.	18.125588392217917
6042. apparently he never	took the trouble to find out.	16.207980682053886
6043. nevertheless he had ample opportunity	to contest the statement before the appeal board.	10.01381971267754
6044. after the recommendation	of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the	appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial.	12.00959658063547
6045. we found in gonzales v united states supra that this	was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be	furnished a registrant.	9.395944134311138
6046. we said there that it was necessary that	a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the department's	recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the	ultimate responsibility for classification.	12.063293010804998
6047. we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's	contention which was considered by the appeal board and	denied by it.	9.434373464433083
6048. as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board	which renders the selective service determination considered 'final'	in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact.	11.357225306546214
6049. estep v united states 327 us 114.	11.118618003375188
6050. 348	u	s at 412-413.	18.919390992859817
6051. but there are other contentions which might	be considered more difficult.	22.307369995297506
6052. at his trial petitioner sought to secure	through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the department's	hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon.	11.209689093614697
6053. petitioner	also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal	bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice.	11.135333448180393
6054. he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld; nor	did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of	investigation reports might disclose.	11.497671768514193
6055. section 6 of the	act	as we have held does require the department's recommendation to	be placed in a registrant's file.	8.536810242711947
6056. gonzales v united states	supra.	16.6462465444584
6057. but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing	officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant.	16.89030426295369
6058. while	the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report	be placed in the registrant's file this requirement was eliminated	in 1952.	10.199987225902532
6059. moreover the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental	is directed to the attorney general and of course is not	the recommendation of the department.	11.255335941528637
6060. it is not essentially different	from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of	which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give	his approval or rejection.	14.745929574137289
6061. it is but part of the whole process within	the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation	to the appeal board.	15.95279880239472
6062. it is also significant that neither this	report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal	board.	15.535634227469462
6063. hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only	conclusions of the department on file with the board.	11.06283852093769
6064. petitioner	knew that the department's recommendation was based not on the hearing	officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his	file.	11.010906136097084
6065. having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local	board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner	cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed.	8.006222804100185
6066. it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the	production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial.	12.591262364392456
6067. in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the	report and notes.	13.995829689404383
6068. while there are now allegations of the withholding	of favorable evidence developed at the hearing and a denial of	a full and fair hearing no such claim was made by petitioner at	any stage of the administrative process.	9.819745382407794
6069. moreover his testimony at	trial never developed any such facts.	12.132340491810675
6070. in the light of these circumstances	as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered	entirely on the department's recommendation which petitioner	repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found	supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's	report and notes.	11.508090407892787
6071. finally petitioner says that he was entitled	to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the	hearing officer as well as at the trial.	10.428950982850354
6072. he did receive a resume of	it- the same that was furnished the appeal board- and he made no	claim of its inaccuracy.	13.147535362247371
6073. even now no such claim is asserted.	14.459971960481784
6074. he bases	his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that	he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume.	11.402211918112066
6075. but this is fully	answered by united states v nugent supra.	18.224663534944504
6076. there we held	that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service	system h entitles conscientious objectors to no guarantee	that	the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection.	10.320575806130957
6077. even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner	here would not be entitled to the report.	13.524280778933955
6078. the recommendation of	the department- as well as the decision of the appeal board- was	based entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report.	11.82959558123692
6079. with this enlarged role in	mind i should like to make a few suggestions: what we in the united	states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what	happens in the rest of the world.	11.203710262542911
6080. we in this department must think about	foreign policy in its total context.	15.104909325408414
6081. we cannot regard foreign policy	as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal	policy has been extracted.	9.68848064886208
6082. foreign policy is the total involvement	of the american people with peoples and governments abroad.	12.931880155135639
6083. that	means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must	think in terms of the total context of our situation.	12.682240901842567
6084. it is the concern	of the department of state that the american people are safe and	secure- defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense.	20.454868256666852
6085. it is also the concern of the department of state that our	trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable	and active- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of	concern only to the department of commerce.	16.479694457271435
6086. we can no longer rely on	interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences	between this and other departments.	14.852792098802231
6087. assistant secretaries of	state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination	of policies.	8.875519561448924
6088. means must be found to enable us to keep in	touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues	in other departments concerned with foreign policy.	9.762220552947062
6089. i think we	need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action.	13.861459511745588
6090. every	policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer.	11.793662721363662
6091. unless we keep	our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target	with the present.	9.031328976717537
6092. the movement of events is so fast the pace so	severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are	to think accurately about the present.	9.733932821009546
6093. if there is anything which we	can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes	by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act	promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct	of our affairs.	11.4233974396433
6094. action taken today is often far more valuable than action	taken several months later in response to a situation then out of	control.	11.164335426742218
6095. there will of course be times for delay and inaction.	23.55710344705893
6096. what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act	we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic	or procedural difficulties.	11.36306486752645
6097. i also hope that we can	do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction	of all bureaucracies.	9.9789661687423
6098. we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom	to the top of the department.	23.79695113216575
6099. we want to make sure that our junior	colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right	down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top.	14.878925611842453
6100. i hope no one	expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources	of ideas.	13.674023786873345
6101. the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating	ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function	regardless of rank.	10.828137405184387
6102. further i would hope that we could	pay attention to little things.	13.886462683990771
6103. while observing the operations of	our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many	situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor	problems which spoiled our main effort.	9.722601367140374
6104. to cite only a few examples:	the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior	position	abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes	of a un delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate	housing in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar	circumstances in our capital can be easily be directed against the united	states and all that it stands for.	11.216442953007778
6105. dozens of seemingly small	matters go wrong all over the world.	11.489534800780755
6106. sometimes those who know about them	are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them.	16.179594062013816
6107. i	would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and	overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the	responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can	do something about them.	8.911462383944718
6108. if the department of state is to take	primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows	that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas.	12.880205965246638
6109. this does	not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational	interested responsible fashion.	10.31176917342438
6110. he is expected to know about what	is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed	in his country.	14.07927509760994
6111. he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct	to assist in any way he can.	15.162589916354984
6112. if any official operation abroad begins	to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and	to get suggestions for remedial action.	12.265355198300655
6113. it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts	which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing	up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy	is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion	for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government.	10.115173546987315
6114. i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems	that a senior departmental policy officer faces.	14.432342251449203
6115. this means practically	everybody in this room.	20.982394141929568
6116. whether it will strike home for you or not	will be for you to determine.	14.768817366925637
6117. the senior policy officer may	be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of	stimuli: an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague	a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another	department a communication from a foreign government or an american	ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the united	nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news	item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the	secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman	an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization	a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad	et cetera ad infinitum.	6.722010263771568
6118. the policy officer lives with his antennae	alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility.	11.128515815750879
6119. his first thought is about the question itself: is	there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is	it?	9.9067210934943
6120.  for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job	is to know what the question is- that when it is accurately identified	it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed	frequently shapes the answer.	17.260774358331712
6121. chewing it over with his colleagues	and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the	question- tentative because it may change as he explores it further	and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed	into one which can be answered.	8.714311256296062
6122. meanwhile he has been thinking	about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can	never be complete and the general background much of which has already	been lost to history.	10.003191755837623
6123. he is appreciative of the expert help available	to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine	at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently	policy-oriented conclusions.	9.443465480283738
6124. he knows that he must give the expert his	place but he knows that he must also keep him in it.	14.895250259945033
6125. he is	already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action	including doing nothing.	10.759594257906194
6126. he knows that he is thinking about action in	relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful	fog.	14.790062577577777
6127. but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy	well-established precedents the commitments of the united states	under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood	notions of the american people about how we are to conduct	ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security	council papers accumulated in the department.	9.443742552746961
6128. he will	not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting	results in the factual situation with which he is confronted.	12.178546429927634
6129. he must	think about which of these principles must take precedence.	12.382440355398003
6130. he will	know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his	problem because of crucial changes in circumstance.	11.457306183256179
6131. he is aware that	every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other	problem.	13.4600611637929
6132. he must deal with the question of how to manage a part	when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole- when the whole	is too large to grasp.	13.81699196938793
6133. he must think of others who have a	stake in the question and in its answer.	12.301958202762274
6134. who should be consulted among	his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies	of the government?	11.623830253822636
6135.  which american ambassadors could provide helpful	advice?	14.004241331408958
6136.  are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted?	16.264149153665286
6137. 	what is the probable attitude of other governments including	those less directly involved?	9.357564939293445
6138.  how and at what stage and in what sequence	are other governments to be consulted?	12.525716249817423
6139.    if action is indicated	what kind of action is relevant to the problem?	12.416327414980506
6140.  the selection	of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted	inflammation of the problem itself.	11.974844441450633
6141. can the president or the secretary	act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money	be required?	9.525730854698702
6142.  should the action be unilateral or multilateral?	15.477875701656684
6143. 	is the matter one for the united nations or some other international	body?	15.42817461977236
6144.  for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary	diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem.	11.361442171265466
6145. what type of action can	hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad?	11.940857385721461
6146. 	for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret	and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned	by the readiness of the country to sustain it.	10.332926875148294
6147. he is interested in	public opinion for two reasons: first because it is important in itself	and second because he knows that the american public cares about	a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.	13.092074065413986
6148. and given probable	public attitudes- about which reasonably good estimates can be made-	what action is called for to insure necessary support?	11.458221476138322
6149.    may	i add a caution on this particular point?	10.530932308755343
6150.  we do not want policy	officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves	too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign	policy action.	13.283409325621754
6151. in the first place our business is foreign policy	and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees	in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of	a problem.	11.619401093368626
6152. mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows	in the department of state don't know much about domestic politics.	11.331156745286023
6153. this is an important consideration.	34.87846511850071
6154. if we sit here	reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports	that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested	opinion expressed in the absence of leadership.	13.451467276997898
6155. what the american	people will do turns in large degree on their leadership.	11.9973409257314
6156. we cannot	test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country	have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them	for support for the necessary action.	13.2364198921653
6157. i doubt for example that	3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the	marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have said that the country	would have accepted such proposals.	9.343026098598246
6158. the problem in the	policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly	complicated factors- political military economic financial legal	legislative procedural administrative- to be sorted out and handled	within a political system which moves by consent in relation to	an external environment which cannot be under control.	9.377436891163361
6159. and the	policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels.	10.909539481296655
6160. while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one	sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and	some open only to men or to women.	10.185533197888695
6161. the peace corps should not pay	the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for	full-time peace corps work on the same project.	10.192665105455669
6162. there should	be no draft exemption because of peace corps service.	17.14451555367524
6163. in most cases	service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary	deferment.	13.796319945376338
6164. peace corps volunteers obviously should not	be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united	states.	10.983779669095595
6165. nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in	health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid.	9.405302737895367
6166. the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation	for individual services.	13.776721535290255
6167. rather the principle should be akin	to that of the allowance.	13.631155364961707
6168. peace corps volunteers should be given	just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living.	12.534532433412945
6169. they should	live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption.	12.728526236680905
6170. wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts.	11.461595236710806
6171. some special health requirements might have to be met.	13.73408483583184
6172. for example	it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to	pay medical expenses of volunteers.	12.616365367189958
6173. perhaps existing public health	service state department and armed services medical facilities	can be utilized.	10.496904995516093
6174. for readjustment to the us volunteers	should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas	service based on the length of time served.	17.758196950820967
6175. the government should the peace corps be established?	17.79787980104254
6176. 	the idea	of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people.	15.944507147604588
6177. support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines.	9.696852031587945
6178. the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension	to our approach to the world- an opportunity for the american	people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world	development.	10.775425919678217
6179. for this the peace corps should be administered	by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole	overseas operation.	10.201174941689553
6180. pending the reorganization of our foreign	aid structure and program the peace corps should be established	as an agency in the department of state.	10.378632112859073
6181. when the aid operations are	reorganized the peace corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional	unit.	13.27292152726367
6182. meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located	in ica's facilities and depend on the state department and	ica for administrative support and when needed program assistance.	12.035025316298146
6183. in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own	identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those	now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas	operations.	10.135970234308642
6184. the peace corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory	work undertaken between now and when congress finally appropriates	special funds for it- or it can be launched now and in earnest	by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from	existing mutual security appropriations to permit a number of substantial	projects to start this summer.	9.445579446743926
6185. the peace corps should	be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified	people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost.	9.076490714119794
6186. nor	should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university	campuses.	11.657344959009736
6187. if launched in a careful but determined way within	the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred	persons in training this summer for placement next fall.	8.781581112714779
6188. within a year	or two several thousand might be in service.	15.616036688852587
6189. it can then grow steadily	as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated.	16.886579020589977
6190. what would the first projects be?	20.77810422282325
6191. 	in the first year there should	probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects.	10.619749179851334
6192. the need here	is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified	volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.	14.595996195114672
6193. there would	however be a variety of other skills- medical agricultural engineering-	which would be called for in the first year through the private	agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers	to existing development projects.	11.835327002263341
6194. the first year's projects	should also be spread through several countries in latin america	africa and asia.	11.067559503896199
6195. although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every	newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to	receive it from the united states will vary from country to country.	10.215120473513949
6196. a certain skepticism about the coming of americans is to be expected	in many quarters.	14.609881020398726
6197. unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything	in their power to promote active hostility.	9.59515281521537
6198. but there are indications	that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers	and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate	their value and make many friends.	12.481671844971721
6199. it is important however	that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war	but as a contribution to the world community.	17.556530134819237
6200. in presenting it to	other governments and to the united nations we could propose that	every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the	united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating	committee.	12.72517734047417
6201. we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly	international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside	citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands.	8.674328034689054
6202. in any case our peace corps personnel should be offered as technician	helpers in development projects of the un and other international	agencies.	12.505795337226303
6203. the peace corps is not a diplomatic or	propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership.	11.083771744607661
6204. our aim must be to learn as much as we teach.	15.514388956008714
6205. the peace corps	offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems	of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country	needs for trained manpower.	0.0
6206. if presented in this spirit the response	and the results will be immeasurably better.	13.89810952822282
6207. financed?	24.303019953065355
6208. 	the already appropriated funds within the discretion of	the president and secretary of state under the mutual security	act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's	pilot programs of the peace corps.	9.436375160325522
6209. if it is decided to make a	small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance	funds in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security	act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign	to the world.	10.445235798347937
6210. congress should then be asked to give the peace corps	a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year.	12.321415233902583
6211. specifically	congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive	contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations	and the public at large.	8.907562454372828
6212. for this must be the project of the whole	american people.	20.050527392146098
6213. an advisory council of outstanding public figures	with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program	continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding.	9.444226275597444
6214. steps should also be taken to link the food for peace	program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated	by the sale of us surplus food under pl 480 can be	put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps	personnel.	9.451677151605837
6215. the extent to which participating bodies such as u	s voluntary agencies universities international organizations	and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should	share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully explored.	9.876369092471661
6216. no matter how well	conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures.	18.777303867980326
6217. these	could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad.	11.51101729069173
6218. but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the	peace corps is very great.	15.868078681324386
6219. it can contribute to the development of	critical countries and regions.	17.783580255549165
6220. it can promote international cooperation	and good will toward this country.	19.5088482139775
6221. it can also contribute to the	education of america and to more intelligent american participation	in the world.	14.490074136864681
6222. with thousands of young americans going to work	in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly	involved in the world than ever before.	12.348689548709578
6223. with colleges and universities	carrying a large part of the program and with students looking	toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational	curriculum and student seriousness.	13.472651034312994
6224. the letters home the talks later	given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on	the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad-	all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible	american policies toward the world.	11.500812774405567
6225. and this is meeting the world's	need too since what the world most needs from this country	is better understanding of the world.	12.173782759969203
6226. the peace corps thus can	add a new dimension to america's world policy- one for which people	here and abroad have long been waiting.	11.263883303335483
6227. as you said in your state	of the union message.	15.493303089797616
6228. the problems h are towering and unprecedented-	and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well.	11.560162828532382
6229. i recommend to the congress	the establishment of a permanent peace corps- a pool of trained	american men and women sent overseas by the us government	or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign	countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower.	8.650405350044208
6230. i	have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on	a temporary pilot basis.	11.438221319163278
6231. the temporary peace corps will be	a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more	effective plans for a permanent organization.	9.015864489495446
6232. in addition by starting	the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and	women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them	in overseas positions by late fall.	11.456381306652677
6233. this temporary peace corps is	being established under existing authority in the mutual security	act and will be located in the department of state.	11.001853610910823
6234. its initial expenses	will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign	aid program.	11.07093722802264
6235. throughout the world the people of the newly	developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which	reflects their deepest desires.	0.0
6236. our own freedom and the future	of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability	to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity	liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty.	10.86575793770652
6237. one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is	the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and	assist in the operation of development projects- men and women with	the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics	and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages	the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations.	10.159163988712244
6238. the vast task of economic development urgently requires	skilled people to do the work of the society- to help teach in the	schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of	sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling	for training and advanced knowledge.	10.183927776627685
6239. to meet this urgent need	for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a peace	corps- an organization which will recruit and train american volunteers	sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations.	10.37749845354295
6240. this organization will differ from existing assistance programs	in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the	specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical	advice to work.	10.091600097037954
6241. they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary	to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments	acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice.	8.976302854198767
6242. there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve	will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them.	27.50748823989477
6243. in 1960 one-quarter of the 92.	21.231002277360044
6244. 5 million	recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for	the primary purpose of hunting and fishing.	12.80790717720961
6245. hunter and fisherman visits	since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale	of hunting and fishing licenses.	8.848516328811625
6246. this use is expected to increase to	about 50 million visits by 1972.	14.46572768738462
6247. the long-range objective of habitat	management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and	game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment.	13.544208612067639
6248. the wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period	are:  revise and complete wildlife habitat management	and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination	between wildlife habitat management and other resources.	9.578073710136277
6249. inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation	with other federal agencies and with the states in which national	forests and grasslands are located as a basis for orderly development	of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs including	big-game gamebird and small-game habitat surveys and investigations	on the 186 million acres of national forests and grasslands	fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81000 miles	of national forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes	and impoundments and participation in planning inspection and	control phases of all habitat improvement land- and water-use projects	conducted on national forest lands by states other federal agencies	and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife	and be in harmony with other resource values.	6.868181156450315
6250. improve food	and cover on 1.	15.068811854765874
6251. 5 million acres of key wildlife areas.	20.154618752359333
6252. develop	wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation	by clearing or controlled burning on 400000 acres.	9.559225930701576
6253. improve	7000 miles of fishing streams and 56000 acres of lakes by stabilizing	banks planting streamside cover and constructing channel improvements.	7.9139724503302755
6254. the total adverse impact of disease insects	fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and	values of forest resources is not generally recognized.	10.04035265795844
6255. they kill and	destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage	values and disrupt uses.	9.92799960869505
6256. the loss in growth of sawtimber because	of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952	was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet.	13.497542232784289
6257. if it were not for the	effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly	twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952.	11.045019226426785
6258. about 45 percent	of the loss in growth was attributable to disease 20 percent to	insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and	various other causes.	9.401696669252939
6259. these destructive forces also have a seriously	adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows	and upon the other renewable forest resources.	8.841986639389681
6260. the long-range	objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below	the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management	of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and	high-level sustained yield of products and services.	9.104900688157647
6261. this can be accomplished	substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities	and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical	fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention	detection and control of insect and disease infestations.	9.23369746217839
6262. in	addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of	timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and	disease.	9.805230221104807
6263. in the 10-year period	it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest	system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and	control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce	the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial	period.	9.352346720382842
6264. this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present	level of protection.	13.780548764963143
6265. the work will consist of:  intensification	of present activities through quicker more extensive and	more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks; more reliable	evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread	damage; quicker and more effective control action in the initial	stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic.	8.135822393237163
6266. the initial suppression	activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated.	12.445450562798397
6267. continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension	of control to 250000 acres not now protected but which should	be managed for white pine production.	7.485565382198017
6268. the objective is to achieve sufficient	effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment	plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance	control will be needed.	10.51598678955206
6269. initiating a program to control	dwarfmistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better	stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites.	7.719095379114949
6270. coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities	to reduce losses.	10.957705180640192
6271. it is proposed	that in	10 years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and	other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for	intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the	fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads.	8.521132938697193
6272. this	will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving	such protection.	10.358652090748608
6273. an additional 15 million acres will be given	a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation.	9.369822837921769
6274. meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for:	expansion modernization and development of fire control	to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many	fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted	standards.	8.94695669099435
6275. this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present	level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews	and equipment use.	12.753785999289317
6276. this will include a stepped-up program of training	and development of personnel.	15.773973169612649
6277. adoption and use of new and	modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires	while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning	intensely.	7.681521373376816
6278. reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize	the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value	areas.	9.723773562266802
6279. this work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land	needing such treatment and will consist of burning 250000 acres of highly	hazardous debris concentration felling snags on 350000 acres of	high lightning-occurrence areas prescribed burning on 3.	7.842582842764774
6280. 5 million acres	removing roadside fuel on 39000 acres and clearing and maintaining	11000 miles of firebreaks.	13.348034631560463
6281. rodent	control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of	the most serious infestations of harmful rodents such as porcupines	and mice on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands.	7.357637118692662
6282. these	areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation	on the national forests.	14.48061217110424
6283. 8 million acres of rangelands	and 9.	15.25536203234011
6284. 4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period.	12.9935982280493
6285. control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means	of control are known.	11.420945864785486
6286. the transportation	system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and	access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions.	10.368542887931138
6287. this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by	the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system	administered by the secretary of agriculture.	9.560862227848798
6288. both of these	systems are essential for the production development and use of the	national	forests.	14.19498447227806
6289. in the forest highway system there are now	24400 miles of public roads.	14.66895635059169
6290. these are mostly through highways that	carry traffic going from one destination to another.	12.639509207762416
6291. because administration	of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary	of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties	this development program for the national forests does not include	estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system	nor to construct the additions to its that are needed.	8.58589157907418
6292. it is estimated	that about 70000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed	to fully serve the national forests.	14.257886077107297
6293. in the forest development	road and trail system there are now 162400 miles of roads and	106500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails.	10.903263476163234
6294. these roads are	largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which	is related to use of the national forests.	11.459020638261407
6295. construction and maintenance	of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture.	15.459184867039452
6296. it is estimated that about 542250 miles of forest development	roads and 80000 miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually	be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of	the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the	national forests on a continuing basis.	10.18612401084764
6297. the ultimate trail system	will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization	and fire protection.	9.646584389395406
6298. it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum	service to these important resources and watersheds.	17.650549974235176
6299. the presence	or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling	influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as:	and wildlife resources	from fire insects and disease;	the volume of timber that	can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent	the level	of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity	to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects	the protection of watershed lands from erosion	and overgrazing by animals.	7.052302139410064
6300. the existence of road systems	permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes	that is not otherwise possible.	10.552736946158015
6301. furthermore roads that give	access to national forest timber are investments which pay their own	way over a period of years.	9.383130922390524
6302. use of these roads by the public results	in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve.	11.852751233793766
6303. the	long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain	a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately	service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected	needs and optimum production of products and services.	7.157887019105229
6304. for the	year 2000 this means servicing the protection requirements of a watershed	producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year	recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors	a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board	feet and 60 million acres of rangelands.	8.552648919602813
6305. service at these	levels of production and utilization will eventually require the	construction of about 379900 miles of new roads and 6000 miles of new	trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105000	miles of roads and 10500 miles of trails.	7.185201728241583
6306. about 26500 miles	of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of	new roads.	12.188116717653141
6307. about 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be	met by the year 2000.	10.750197781886257
6308. program proposals for forest development	roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows:	complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79400	miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8000 miles of trails.	8.511813496058547
6309. this constitutes	about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities.	13.024388173904455
6310. approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on	roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed	by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by	the government through adjustment of stumpage prices.	10.679037667401245
6311. provide	maintenance to full standards on the 268900 miles of existing access	roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during	the period.	8.709896173564369
6312. within the	units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership	is quite irregular.	13.962026258073651
6313. in some units national forest ownership is well	blocked together.	15.376475610501938
6314. in many others the previous patenting of land	under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for	purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership.	12.396206978673883
6315. within	exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands	there are about 40000000 acres in non-federal ownership.	8.450640073948662
6316. one consequence	is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners	of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring	national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are	developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public	of neighboring national forest land.	8.763370826233546
6317. some privately held inholdings	are a source of direct damage to these federal lands.	11.075329357402437
6318. and some which	are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes	are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing	nothing to the economy; there are no reasonable prospects	that these conditions will be corrected or changed.	9.395919591964034
6319. lands in this last	category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern	states.	9.123795748372075
6320. the long-range objective is to bring about consolidation	of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through	purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts	for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development	or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests	and national grasslands.	8.754771969638025
6321. strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now	undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history.	10.445978550196845
6322. the change of	emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made	with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected	in favor of the other.	10.89846244057107
6323. our military forces must be capable of	contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon	us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war.	8.746321774054373
6324. the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately	the present level- a year-end strength of 2489000 men and	women in the active forces.	9.975619206466462
6325. the forces to be supported include an army	of 14 divisions and 870000 men; a navy of 817 active ships and	619000 men; a marine corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000	men; and an air force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men.	7.506372862869111
6326. if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war	their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing	character and missions of the active forces.	11.096974934687399
6327. quality and combat readiness	must take precedence over mere numbers.	10.057988591011652
6328. under modern conditions	this is especially true of the ready reserve.	15.302692004867998
6329. i have requested the	secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve	components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light	of the changing requirements of modern warfare.	10.76133408046316
6330. last year	the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength	limitations on the army reserve.	11.643390011935976
6331. similar restrictions on the	strength of the army national guard contained in the 1960 department	of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped.	10.205046331281359
6332. i strongly	recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on	the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility	to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity.	12.26219097173837
6333. i again	proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve-	from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 respectively	to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961.	10.174681773123066
6334. these	strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions	of the reserves in support of our national security objectives.	11.57264366579145
6335. about 30% of the expenditures for	the department of defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs	including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel.	8.0256804335791
6336. these	expenditures are estimated to be $12.	13.915190642667962
6337. 1 billion an increase of $187	million over 1960 reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel	more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency	pay and social security tax increases	.	8.65809274365107
6338. retired pay costs are	increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial	increase in the number of retired personnel.	12.084735104210335
6339. these increased costs	are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures	for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength	of the army reserve components during 1961.	8.390984762634526
6340. traditionally	rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate	to current rates of pay for active personnel.	9.559225930701576
6341. the 1958 military	pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6%	increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior	to its effective date of june 1 1958.	8.07465750136534
6342. i endorse pending legislation	that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and	active duty pay rates.	12.008358694542157
6343. expenditures	for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed	forces are estimated to be $10.	8.718911986576943
6344. 3 billion in 1961 which is $184	million more than in 1960.	13.986123044112725
6345. the increase stems largely from the growing	complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons	and equipment.	9.733439205766894
6346. a substantial increase is estimated in the	cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense	program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications	are essential.	12.3842593737271
6347. also the program for fleet modernization	will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures.	11.220819865417468
6348. further	increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted	by the congress last year.	10.358652090748608
6349. other factors increasing operating	costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up 11% in two	years and of each steaming hour up 15%.	7.819813301643807
6350. in total these increases	in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining	programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units	and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements	in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces.	9.060103348462347
6351. in the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 i recommended	immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 1951	.	10.541588958090149
6352. this section prevents the military departments and	the office of civil and defense mobilization from carrying out certain	transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement	with the committees on armed services of the senate and the house	of representatives.	9.307968576962482
6353. as i have stated previously the attorney	general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional	principles.	13.77184342876398
6354. accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress	at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but	to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless	a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.	11.040767162887139
6355. basic	long-line communications in alaska are now provided through federal	facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation	agency.	8.161708859576924
6356. the growing communications needs of this new state can best	be met as they have in other states through the operation and development	of such facilities by private enterprise.	10.284602819318303
6357. legislation has already	been proposed to authorize the sale of these government-owned	systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable.	8.56146549168591
6358. for the department of defense are for procurement research	development and construction programs.	16.955909390619336
6359. in 1961 these expenditures	are estimated at $18.	17.082886650303927
6360. 9 billion compared to $19.	16.39416094821138
6361. the	decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement	are offset in part by increases for research and development and	for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles	guns and electronic devices.	7.828053989621275
6362. expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated	at about the same level as in 1960.	12.16467872163988
6363. new obligational authority	for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement	totals $4753	million which is $1390 million below that enacted for 1960.	8.261632359299972
6364. on the	other hand the new authority of $3825 million proposed for missile	procurement in 1961 is $581 million	higher than for 1960.	11.871143346099638
6365. these contrasting trends in procurement reflect	the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our armed	forces in the years ahead.	9.743038339624356
6366. the department of defense appropriation	acts for the past several years have contained a rider which	limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain	military supply items.	13.476890931644855
6367. as i have repeatedly stated this provision is	much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy	american act.	12.975567681280939
6368. i urge once again that the congress not reenact	this rider.	15.196081178306065
6369. the task of providing a reasonable level of military	strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security	is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress.	8.950940478233589
6370. the	last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances	in military technology in history.	10.512387588911063
6371. some weapons systems have	become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under	development.	10.28238949363653
6372. furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a	technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often	diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems.	9.254023890597805
6373. this	has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense	program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important	weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems	which have been overtaken by events.	7.321981225721081
6374. thus in the last few years a	number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development	was commenced have since been completely eliminated.	15.744653062518728
6375. for example	the importance of the regulus 2 a very promising aerodynamic	ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines	was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more	advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines.	7.649772078391847
6376. another example is the recent cancellation of the f-108	a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed	of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the	period of the mid-1960's.	9.75842002511081
6377. the substantial progress being made in ballistic	missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned	bombers to missiles.	9.43281219160674
6378. considering the high cost of the f-108	system- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned- and	the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to	stop further work on the project.	11.993470766982032
6379. meanwhile other air defense forces	are being made effective as described later in this message.	9.106623935092388
6380. the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from	earlier plans.	16.57589883076356
6381. notable in this category are the jupiter and thor	intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed	produced and deployed but the relative importance of which	has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile.	7.624343070487837
6382. the impact of technological factors	is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program.	17.200143473521717
6383. this project was started at a time when there was a critical need for	a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance	aircraft particularly our heavy bombers.	9.759189138408797
6384. continuing technical	problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant	improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious	questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program.	12.32064222608408
6385. as	a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed.	10.308751498281113
6386. these examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations	of new major development programs and even more penetrating and	far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology.	10.270362670278223
6387. the	cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the	greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development	in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in	deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production	or to abandon it.	6.960994771428205
6388. the deterrent power	of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability	and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any	form of war.	9.602164633469624
6389. the first capability is represented by a combination	of manned bombers carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate	range missiles.	11.434756280856513
6390. the second capability is represented by our	deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together	with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement.	10.316523895376763
6391. the strategic air command is the principal element	of our long-range nuclear capability.	10.924225450335342
6392. one of the important and difficult	decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role	of the b-70 a long-range supersonic bomber.	18.267655175291047
6393. this aircraft which	was planned for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary	to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile	systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier.	8.789127801431237
6394. the first atlas icbm's are now operational the first two	polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year	and the first titan icbm's next year.	11.72530621692234
6395. the minuteman solid-fueled	icbm is planned to be operational about mid-1963.	11.572314230763848
6396. by	1965 several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and	their reliability established.	11.705406275320591
6397. thus the need for the b-70	as a strategic weapon system is doubtful.	15.040027455715425
6398. however i am recommending	that development work on the b-70 air-frame and engines be continued.	13.003061406111586
6399. it is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available	for flight testing.	14.929520727844796
6400. by that time we should be in a much better	position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system.	17.9770757180962
6401. i am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version	of the b-52	and procurement of the b-58 supersonic medium bomber together with	the supporting refueling tankers in each case.	8.83016101805919
6402. these additional modern	bombers will replace some of the older b-47 medium bombers;	one b-52 can do the work of several b-47's which it will replace.	12.72854536690647
6403. funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping	of the b-52 wings with the hound dog air-to-surface missile.	8.452240474971315
6404. in the coming fiscal year additional quantities of atlas titan	and polaris missiles also will be procured.	14.950907460670404
6405. purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale	and delivery of commodities including the classes types andor varieties	of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees	accruing	from such sale and other relevant matters.	7.267272540130052
6406. the united states	recognizes the desire of india to accumulate as quickly as possible	a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice	provided for in this agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal	markets for this commodity in india.	10.860971410274235
6407. under this agreement the first	annual review of rice availabilities will be made in august 1960.	13.244576275685455
6408. at that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of	the united states supplies of rice available for title 1 disposal	india's production consumption and stocks of food grains other	imports from the united states and countries friendly to the united	states india's storage capacity and other related factors any	increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed	which is currently planned for procurement during the first year.	0.0
6409. the two governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations	for wheat and rice providing for purchase after june 30 1961	shall be dependent upon the determination by the united states	government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available	under title 1 of the act at that time.	8.42849722714796
6410. the united states government	shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales	under this agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time	after june 30 1961 that such action is necessitated by the existence	of an international emergency.	10.328213905878275
6411. the two governments agree that the rupees accruing to the government	of the united states of america as a consequence of sales	made pursuant to this agreement will be used by the government of	the united states of america in such manner and order of priority	as the government of the united states of america shall determine	for united	states expenditures under subsections	of section 104 of the act or under	for grant to the government of india under subsection	of section 104 of the act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538	million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development	for loan	to the government of india under subsection of section 104	of the act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for	financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may	be mutually agreed.	9.30161959594001
6412. the terms and conditions of the loan and other	provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two governments.	12.212997045118417
6413. in the event that agreement is not reached on the use	of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date	of this agreement the government of the united states of america	may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by section	104 of the act.	10.406765915619621
6414. in the event the total of rupees accruing	to the government of the united states of america as a consequence	of sales made pursuant to this agreement is different from the rupee	equivalent of $1276 million the amounts available for the purposes	specified in paragraph 1 article 2 will be adjusted proportionately.	12.824659172335624
6415. the deposit of rupees to	the account of the government of the united states of america in payment	for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed	by the government of the united states of america	costs resulting from the requirement that united states flag vessels	shall be made at the rate of exchange for united states dollars	generally applicable to import transactions	in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement	by united states banks or by the government of the united states	of america as provided in the purchase authorizations.	12.193788392737838
6416. 4 general undertakings	the government of india agrees	that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or	transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes	of	the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions	of this agreement and to assure that the purchase of such commodities	does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities	for export from india.	8.833240247170044
6417. the two governments agree that	they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases	of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the agreement	will not displace usual marketings of the united states of america	in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural	commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries.	8.710107734546797
6418. in carrying out this agreement the two governments	will seek to assure to the extent practicable conditions of commerce	permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their	best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural	commodities.	9.728163946089595

6424. for the government of the united states of america:	dwight d eisenhower   for the government	of india:   s k patil	excellency:   i have the honor to refer to the agricultural	commodities agreement signed today between the government of the	united states of america and the government of india	and with regard to the rupees accruing	to uses indicated under article 2 of the agreement to state	that the understanding of the government of the united states of	america is as follows:  with respect to article 2 paragraph	the government	of india will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent	of $4 million accruing	under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes	into currencies other than united states dollars on request of	the government of the united states of america.	12.869726854022426
6425. this facility is	needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market	development activities of the government of the united states in	other countries.	15.640422740544041
6426. the government of the united states of america	may utilize rupees in india to pay for goods and services including	international transportation needed in connection with market development	and other agricultural projects and activities in india and	other countries.	14.268322278971274
6427. but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the agreement	will be used for loans to be made by the export-import bank	of washington under section 104 of the agricultural trade	development and assistance act as amended	and for administrative expenses of the export-import	bank of washington in india incident thereto.	9.114424597509965
6428. it is understood that:	such loans under section 104 of the act will	be made to united states business firms and branches subsidiaries	or affiliates of such firms in india for business development and trade	expansion in india and to united states firms and to indian firms	for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization	distribution or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets	for united states agricultural products.	9.260326946150725
6429. in the event the rupees set	aside for loans under section 104 of the act are not advanced	within six years from the date of this agreement because the export-import	bank of washington has not approved loans or because proposed	loans have not been mutually agreeable to the export-import bank	of washington and the department of economic affairs of the government	of india the government of the united states of america	may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by section 104 of the	loans will be mutually agreeable to the export-import	bank of washington and the government of india acting through	the department of economic affairs of the ministry of finance.	8.35113149932066
6430. the	secretary department of economic affairs or his designate will	act for the government of india and the president of the export-import	bank of washington or his designate will act for the export-import	upon receipt of an application	which the export-import bank is prepared to consider the export-import	bank will inform the department of economic affairs	of the identity of the applicant the nature of the proposed business	the amount of the proposed loan and the general purposes for which the	when the export-import	bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application it will so notify	the department of economic affairs and will indicate the interest	rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed	loan.	9.067800936592743
6431. the interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in india	on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the	within sixty days after the receipt	of notice that the export-import bank is prepared to act favorably	upon an application the department of economic affairs will indicate	to the export-import bank whether or not the department of	economic affairs has any objection to the proposed loan.	8.046084692665126
6432. unless within	the sixty-day period the export-import bank has received such	a communication from the department of economic affairs it shall be	understood that the department of economic affairs has no objection	to the proposed loan.	9.825668480487627
6433. when the export-import bank approves or declines	the proposed loan it will notify the department of economic	affairs.	12.06833005405757
6434. with respect to article 2 paragraphs 1	and 1:	uses of section 104 rupees: the	government of india will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned	to it by the united states pursuant to paragraphs 1	for projects to promote economic development with emphasis upon	the agricultural sector including food reserve storage structures and	facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the authorized	representatives of the united states and the authorized representatives	of the government of india in the following sectors:	agriculture.	11.133538308741338
6435. industry including the production of fertilizer	irrigation and power transport and communications and credit institutions.	10.411485227453653
6436. other economic development projects consistent with the purposes	of sections 104 of the act.	11.131427923863393
6437. the government	of india further agrees in cooperation with the government of the	united states to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided	for in paragraphs 1	and 1 of article 2 with such direct	dollar assistance as may be made available by the government of	the united states of america so that both sources of financing may	be channeled to specific and clearly identifiable economic development	programs and projects.	8.392755929362185
6438. it is agreed that any goods delivered	or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects	within categories a b and c under paragraph 2 above which	may later be approved by the united states will be eligible for financing	from currency granted or loaned to the government of india.	11.914944962262345
6439. with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under	article 2 of the agreement the understanding of the government	of the united states of america with respect to both paragraphs 1	local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the government of india	for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1	of article 2 of the agreement upon the presentation of such	the	government of india shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and	records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed	projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 of article	2 of the agreement to disclose the use thereof in the projects	and to record the progress of the projects.	8.313606808933057
6440. the books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained	for the duration of the project or until the expiration of three	years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the united	states whichever is later.	12.51958959128086
6441. the two governments shall have the	right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and	all other documents correspondence memoranda and other records involving	transactions relating to agreed projects.	8.10400052573215
6442. the government of india	shall enable the authorized representatives of the united states	to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and	services financed under the projects and shall furnish to the united	states all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning	the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto.	9.850194182312832
6443. this broad delegation leaves within our discretion	both the determination	of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the	methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided.	8.001514491340126
6444. the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast	band from 540 kc to 1600 kc.	15.126708397176124
6445. whenever two or more standard	broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent	frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of	the other.	9.449610226019214
6446. the extent of such interference- which may be so slight	as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders	a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service	areas of both stations- depends on many factors among the principal	ones being the distance between the stations their respective	radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day.	9.443967957665402
6447. other factors playing a part in the the extent of am service	and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position	of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along	the	transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others.	9.084147796518598
6448. with the	existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously	has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments	of am stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure	against any interference in any circumstances.	9.775002288578413
6449. rather such assignments	are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules	and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to	the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables	and averaging out others	in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection	against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of	stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation.	8.894553069669048
6450. an example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established	for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference	which is regarded as objectionable.	11.279609109597365
6451. by this standard it is determined	that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved	objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within	the service area of station b where station a's signal	is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station b's	signal at that point.	8.398680149620548
6452. the 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel	interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which	we must always take into account in am assignments and allocations-	that signals from a particular station are potential sources	of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within	which they provide useful service.	8.896253630473446
6453. a second fundamental principle	is that involved particularly in the present proceeding- the difference	between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect	to the standard broadcast frequencies.	9.169145758850293
6454. this is a phenomenon familiar	to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at	night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere.	12.358023437490031
6455. all am stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals	at all hours; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave	radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during	this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference	are in general negligible.	8.524306027239053
6456. but during nighttime hours the skywave	radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility	of one station's rendering service via skywave at a much	greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the	same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the	still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference	to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent	frequencies.	8.968911785749434
6457. because of the difference between daytime and nighttime	propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation	structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am	band with many more stations operating during the day than at night.	10.571946320261931
6458. it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime	to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous	process but takes place over periods of time from roughly	2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from	roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise.	9.767726963148593
6459. during	the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions	are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail; during	the same period around sunrise skywave transmission is declining	until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes	of little practical significance.	7.180054594365896
6460. however in this case as elsewhere	it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to	all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to	fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points	between daytime and nighttime conditions.	11.508139669295277
6461. it was determined that	the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this	purpose.	16.540937586475135
6462. accordingly the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations	upon the operation of daytime stations.	12.955202999815834
6463. class 2 stations	operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate	under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset	or sunset at the location of the dominant	class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station	.	0.0
6464. the same restrictions apply	after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on	regional channels which after that time are required to operate under	nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other.	12.473885301655931
6465. with respect	to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference	is determined by skywave curves	giving average skywave values.	10.051081963911168
6466. these curves were derived	by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data.	13.034410421526688
6467. it was recognized	that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great	variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength.	11.856977005260697
6468. for this	reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary	in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave	primary service and for both skywave service and skywave	interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of	time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded- 50 percent of	the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference.	9.873232745033398
6469. as mentioned the allocation	of am stations represents a balance between protection against	interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number	of stations.	9.250609199572734
6470. the rules and policies to be applied in this process of	course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired	if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation.	11.801029566924171
6471. our objectives	to provide some	to provide as many choices of	to provide service	of local origin to as many listeners as possible.	8.66762321517122
6472. since broadcast	frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some	extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and	to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction	of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others.	10.357631976064532
6473. accordingly	the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern	for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern	for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use	by different classes of stations.	7.213992261087735
6474. some 45 frequencies are assigned for	use primarily by dominant class 1- a or class 1-	b clear-channel stations designed to operate with adequate	power and to provide service- both groundwave and skywave-	over large areas and at great distances being protected against	interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective.	8.896344352702915
6475. in dealing	with these frequencies the objective listed first above- provision	of service to all listeners- was predominant; the other objectives	were subordinated to it.	8.856646330041947
6476. the class 1 stations on these clear	channels are protected to their 0.	13.2746380816454
6477. 1-mvm groundwave contours	against daytime cochannel interference.	11.867291106449708
6478. with respect to skywave service	rendered at night class 1- a stations are the only stations	permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified	for class 1- a operation and so render skywave service	free	from cochannel interference whereever they may be received; class	1- b stations are protected at night to their 0.	9.833815705634343
6479. 5-mvm	50-percent	time skywave contours against cochannel interference.	11.867291106449708
6480. since	the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference	only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service.	10.011221978713197
6481. but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course	entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which	is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it.	9.622584461095489
6482. with	respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local	and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively	stations operating generally with lower power.	8.826896954946323
6483. in the allocation	pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range	service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives-	assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations	in as many communities as possible.	9.157738782043996
6484. as mentioned the primary	allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations	on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from	destructive interference.	10.249471396796938
6485. during nighttime hours because of the intense	skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can	be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area	service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily	by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render	it.	9.07102439897389
6486. therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of	these channels no station other than the dominant	station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1- a	station can render service interference free wherever it can be received.	9.728813572038947
6487. on the remainder of the clear channels the dominant	stations are protected as described above and the relatively	small number of secondary stations permitted to operate	on these channels at night are required to operate directionally	andor with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations.	9.68367688182339
6488. in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively	inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number	of stations on these channels.	16.28786343257252
6489. additional class 2 assignments	for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference	to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation	provide additional service on these channels and additional local	outlets for a large number of communities.	9.79535765295793
6490. such additional daytime	class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made	of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large	number of them.	10.826514245884367
6491. similarly on the regional channels many class 3	stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate	nighttime with directional antennas andor lower power.	7.828810831110529
6492. essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime	skywave proceeding is whether our decision in 1938-1939 to	assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset	is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light	of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission	is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and	after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and	some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these	hours.	0.0
6493. the decision	reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount	of data and thorough study thereof.	10.43135427689265
6494. since then there has been a notable	increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional	data and the development of new techniques for using it leading	to a better understanding of propagation phenomena.	13.258531228906566
6495. in 1947 affidavits	were filed with the commission by various clear-channel stations	alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service	areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations	whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to	create skywave intereference.	7.494465246344
6496. if you elect to use the standard deduction or the tax table and	later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by	filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim	for refund.	10.87481322869868
6497. see you may claim a refund page 135.	13.048558257328207

6579. you may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to	purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally	obligated to furnish him and even though you may be entitled to his	services.	9.16690485505515
6580. the one- or two-season hunt of which there have been too many recently	may do more harm than good; for such programs raise hopes of assistance	toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which	are dashed when the programs are discontinued; and they are dashed	no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development	toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit.	9.250744817540506
6581. for	the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any	foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments	of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good: such judgments	can be known to be good only by the records of those selected	by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods	of time.	7.810590022855699
6582. the central group of the foundation's advisors	are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board	consisting now of thirty-six men and women.	14.034995925326276
6583. they are chosen by the	foundation's board of trustees on the bases of their own first-rate	accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts.	10.072722102499608
6584. their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations	in the several kinds of educational and research institutions	that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths	also are factors in the trustees' minds.	12.953867914434229
6585. for this concept of an	advisory board ancillary to the board of trustees we are indebted	to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell	a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions	and their administration.	11.075051688149248
6586. that we had the wit and wisdom to adopt mr	lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection	is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly	pretty uniformly good.	11.743190323077632
6587. for in accordance with mr lowell's	concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced	selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes	and our choices.	9.549348483160792
6588. and lest we should become too consistent in the	sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points	of view in the arts the foundation's board of trustees maintains	a trickle- not a flow!- of new members through the advisory board.	10.140376776070358
6589. two committees of members of the advisory board constitute	the committees of selection- one for the selection of fellows	from canada the united states and the english-speaking caribbean	area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american	republics and the republic of the philippines.	9.86184859464356
6590. to the members	of our advisory board and most specially to its members who constitute	our committees of selection the foundation is indebted for its	successes of choice of fellows.	10.421433360798918
6591. we are as we know utterly dependent	on the quality of advice we get; and quality of advice added to	devotion to the foundation's purposes and ideals we do get from	our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated	only by those of us who work here every day.	10.295624666042489
6592. but the facts about	our advisory board and its members' duties are only one of several	sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative	on which to base our selections of fellows.	11.251112306494027
6593. for example the	interest of past members of the foundation's advisory board remains	such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal	much as they had done when they were formally members of that board.	9.094093793828431
6594. and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers	of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants	of government and men of affairs- hundreds indeed- who serve	the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis	out of their experience.	11.247546619711121
6595. to all the foundation gives the kind	of thanks which are more than thanks: to them we are grateful beyond	the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are.	8.490600739721163
6596. it is a truism of business that no business can be better than	its board of directors and its top management.	15.425044969414909
6597. the same is true of	every foundation.	21.168577419809772
6598. during the biennium reviewed in this report our	board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the	board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class	administration of the foundation's affairs:   dr	james brown fisk physicist president of the bell telephone laboratories	was elected to the board of trustees.	11.575833744012263
6599. he is a member	both of the national academy of sciences and of the american philosophical	society; and he has served our country well as a scientific	statesman on international commissions.	12.636970711815833
6600. dr gordon n	ray provost vice-president and professor of english in the university	of illinois was appointed associate secretary general.	10.188749122868447
6601. the trustees of the foundation appointed dr ray to that position	with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present secretary	general upon the latter's eventual retirement.	8.939964905138517
6602. dr ray is	a fellow of the foundation- appointed thrice to assist his studies	of william makepeace thackeray and of h g wells- and	before his appointment to the foundation's executive staff had been	given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the advisory board.	8.320524254217032
6603. referring further to the foundation's officers dr	james f mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as	associate secretary was promoted to be secretary.	8.308506731501172
6604. he is a historian	with the great merit of a historian's long view.	17.7129700558099
6605. also appointed	to the foundation's staff as assistant secretary is mr	j kellum smith jr.	9.557776961493426
6606. mr smith like the present secretary	general is a lawyer; and lawyers- with the great virtues	that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are	able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions	to difficult problems in many fields- are indispensable even in a foundation	office.	9.124083815723493
6607. the present secretary general has been the	foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the	foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago.	9.862715469176807
6608. but even he will	not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are quite	simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the foundation's	policies and practices.	11.120736351476541
6609. the effective recognition of excellence and	its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even	in a year.	10.710501671803797
6610. we are not given to lamentations neither personally	nor in these reports.	19.421987438886447
6611. on the contrary if this be an apocalyptic	era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity.	13.050635763265506
6612. for	granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved these	problems make great demands; and by their demanding tend to create	resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers	do not bring forth.	8.671127844238192
6613. of this examples are legion: pericles speaking	his funeral oration in ancient greece's extremity after thermopylae	and making it a testament of freedom; jefferson writing the	declaration of independence amid the catastrophes of revolution;	christ preaching the sermon on the mount close to his ultimate sacrifice;	shakespeare speaking with the indescribable gusto of the	elizabethan voice- keats's words- in the days of the spanish	armada's threats; isaac newton at the age of twenty-three	industriously calculating logarithms to two and fifty places during	the great plague year in england 1665; winston churchill's	olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when britain stood alone	against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago; the	present-day explorations of outer space answering age-old questions	of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of extinction.	7.874787023876288
6614. forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the roman poet	virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers	of today.	9.159936216703418
6615. it gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many	catastrophes of the past produced; and it is to be noted also that	confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared	in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind.	9.609707845223838
6616. for example out of the social evils of the english industrial	revolution came the novels of charles dickens; and his genius	moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all western men-	until today- in the industrialized west these social evils	substantially do not exist.	10.15291995380078
6617. the solutions were not arrived at by any	theoreticians of the karl marx stripe but by men of government- lawyers	most of them- and men of business.	8.359991737733168
6618. these were educated men	who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions	out of experience under the burden of responsibility.	10.504187999104893
6619. that is	to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit	or they had to get the votes to get elected.	10.023415787128986
6620. nevertheless they made	naught of marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers-	to use marx's word- more than a subsistence wage with	the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its	way into the capitalists' pockets with the result in turn that the	gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery	of the poor increase.	8.614574151534347
6621. but as all understand who have eyes	to see nothing of the kind has happened; indeed the contrary has	happened.	11.876074675428354
6622. the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed	in the industrialized western world to the point that the word	poor is hardly applicable.	11.43780070793399
6623. and the reason this could happen is	clear: men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned	themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their	concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of	freedom and opportunity.	8.729079799651423
6624. some would say that they were not permitted	to run their businesses only for profit; and even putting it that	way would not prove that marx was anything but wrong.	10.696305438763272
6625. sir henry	sumner maine a hundred years before communism was a force to be	reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that the	progress of society is from status to contract.	8.152056347706267
6626. the essence of contract	is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not	do.	13.645408673629904
6627. hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice.	12.490219319538266
6628. the greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater	the range of choice; the greater the range of choice the greater	the rate of change.	12.11117703556191
6629. for change is dependent on the possibilities that	individual men glimpse for the future.	12.716147131389784
6630. but when there is not freedom	and opportunity to choose men- individual men- must remain in status	and society does not cannot progress.	13.10279699675769
6631. the eternal truth	is that progress- due as it always is to individual creative genius-	is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the	beating of the heart.	8.072426973448911
6632. and lest anybody think that considerations	such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten	them with the truths that under communism there would have been	no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would	not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed	untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative	efforts for the good of mankind.	9.954020696235105
6633. during the year 1959	we granted 354 fellowships; in 1960 we granted 334.	16.6071571266639
6634. as heretofore	our fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of	knowledge and creative effort in all the arts.	12.279296993448352
6635. we do not favor one field	over another: we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic	creation is good- provided only that it contributes to a sense	and understanding of the true ends of life as all first-rate scholarship	and artistic creation does.	9.48985075247035
6636. indeed if pressed we would say what	the late robert henri american painter said to a pupil anything	will do for a subject: it's what you do with it that counts.	9.93652802870721
6637. thus we have no part and want none in current discussions	of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities	the creative arts.	9.044680852979823
6638. we want no part in such discussions because	we think them largely futile; and we think them largely futile because	for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every	artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of	view.	10.153090345443246
6639. when the brown + sharpe manufacturing company reached its	125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 it became an almost	unique institution in the mechanical world.	9.461465633075361
6640. with its history	standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution	brown + sharpe has become over the years a singular monument	to the mechanical foresight of its founder joseph r brown and	a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology.	9.636632839289195
6641. joseph r brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise	of new england between 1810 and 1830.	9.430392941896105
6642. he was early exposed to	the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father david	brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade.	11.149943584214672
6643. at the	age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott +	harris in valley falls rhode island and following two or three	other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business	for himself in 1831 making lathes and small tools.	7.76534377925249
6644. this enterprise	led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 under the name	d brown + son a business which eventually grew into the modern	corporation we now call brown + sharpe.	9.200619687972655
6645. the years of joseph's	partnership with his father were numbered.	15.746249834817961
6646. in 1838 a devastating	fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved	west to illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years.	9.939143676091746
6647. joseph brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding	the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those	first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the	standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world.	7.732741736410697
6648. much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with	clock movements.	15.165781587677479
6649. during these early years the repair of watches and	clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed	an important part of the young man's occupation.	10.3648053924128
6650. he became particularly	interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's	and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during	this period.	10.88941294141472
6651. but his business also grew and we are told that mr	brown found it	increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his	creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire.	9.40659364799978
6652. it must have	been with some pleasure and relief that on september 12 1848 joseph	brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically	cryptic style lucian sharpe came to work for me this day	as an apprentice.	10.450607206973826
6653. the young apprentice apparently did well	by mr brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship lucian	was offered a full partnership in the firm; the company became j	r brown + sharpe and entered into a new and important	period of its development.	8.805168422160763
6654. mr sharpe's arrival in the business	did indeed provide what mr brown had most coveted- time for tinkering	and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those	developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that	time.	9.895102405621952
6655. by 1853 the new partnership announced the precision	vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts.	9.836452891194703
6656. the basic	significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855	by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing	engine.	11.08406054990517
6657. that development in turn formed the foundation of still more	significant expansions in later years- in gear cutting in circular	graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy	was a paramount requirement.	7.8894667845432265
6658. throughout their careers both	mr brown and mr sharpe were interested in the problem of setting	up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades.	12.449911227816324
6659. several	efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive	to this day the brown + sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted	as the american standard and is still in common use today.	8.80380372954626
6660. as one development followed another the company's reputation for	precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities	for expansion in precision manufacture.	10.160821930547701
6661. in 1858 the partnership	began manufacturing the willcox + gibbs sewing machine.	12.08839462150559
6662. as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back	counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a	magazine of the famous howe sewing machine.	11.237740531795883
6663. curious as to what made	it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel	until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling	the crude machine to take stitches.	8.239943154124234
6664. when he showed this model as his	solution as to how the howe sewing machine operated he was	told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the howe	machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while	the one that he had perfected used only one.	10.544721445705257
6665. thus was invented the	single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with	mr willcox decided to bring to brown + sharpe with the proposal	that the small company undertake its manufacture.	7.607276063861843
6666. the new work	was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly	for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r	brown toward yet further developments for production equipment.	11.087556851560851
6667. the turret screw machine now known as the brown + sharpe hand	screw machine takes its ancestry directly from mr brown's efforts	to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing	machine.	9.152653344923385
6668. mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine	design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret	by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible	tap and die holders.	9.865546657586746
6669. in 1861 mr brown's attention	was called to yet another basic production problem- the manufacture	of twist drills.	10.058592376379565
6670. at that time during the civil war union muskets	were being manufactured in providence and the drills to drill them	were being hand-filed with rattail files.	0.0
6671. this process neither satisfied	the urgent production schedules nor mr brown's imagination	of the possibilities in the situation.	10.051040398458198
6672. the child of this problem was	mr brown's famous serial no 1 universal milling machine	the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type	milling machine used throughout the world.	10.120535695754949
6673. the original machine bearing	its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the brown + sharpe	precision center in providence.	9.522921261660029
6674. during the civil war	period mr brown also invented the brown + sharpe formed tooth	gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's	gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics.	10.478819940522483
6675. up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear	teeth but they were good for only one sharpening.	11.033431375044579
6676. as soon as the	time came for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost	and a new cutter had to be made.	12.439279240351798
6677. this process made the economical	manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit	the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss	of the precision form.	7.921239730935255
6678. mr brown's invention achieved this and	as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown + sharpe's position	of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until	the 1920's when superceded by other methods.	8.78929651784104
6679. the micrometer	caliper as a common workshop tool also owes much to j r brown.	10.490169973236336
6680. although mr brown was not himself its inventor	it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance	of mass producing this basic tool for general use.	9.582871675199902
6681. so it was	that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool	on exhibition in paris in 1868 they brought a sample with them to the	united states and started brown + sharpe in yet another field where	it retains its leadership to this day.	7.6923073885944335
6682. the final achievement	of mr brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a	close second in importance to his development of the universal milling	machine.	11.148636256668306
6683. that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding	machine which made its appearance in 1876 at the philadelphia centennial	exposition.	9.07564579801177
6684. this machine like its milling counterpart was	the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision	metalworking shops throughout the world.	10.248186645599432
6685. along with j r brown's	other major developments the universal grinding machine was profoundly	influential in setting the course of brown + sharpe for many	years to come.	9.757349826153904
6686. following mr brown's death there came	forward in the brown + sharpe organization many other men who contributed	greatly to the development of the company.	11.44658609222022
6687. one such man was samuel	darling.	23.051606381223657
6688. as head of the firm darling + swartz mr	darling began by challenging brown + sharpe to its keenest competition	during the 1850's and early 60's.	12.7122635581675
6689. in 1868 however a truce	was called between the companies and the partnership of darling brown	+ sharpe was formed.	9.566762736688997
6690. between that year and the buying out of mr	darling's interest in 1892 a large portion of the company's precision	tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown	+ sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still	bearing that famous trademark.	9.162792673865829
6691. perhaps the outstanding standard	bearer of mr brown's tradition for accuracy was mr oscar	j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of	mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly	accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown + sharpe	to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding	anything then available elsewhere in the world.	7.702498743356058
6692. also important	on the brown + sharpe scene at the turn of the century was	mr richmond viall works superintendent of the company from	1876 to 1910.	13.147290636889343
6693. mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership	and development of men.	10.74730553741912
6694. he was an ardent champion of the brown	+ sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able	men who first developed their industrial talents with the company.	10.924596016381054
6695. in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown + sharpe	products over the years has been the men who began work with the	company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout	the nation and even abroad.	12.341181339329454
6696. commencing with the death of	lucian sharpe in 1899 the name of henry d sharpe was for more	than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company.	9.574012663971168
6697. during	his presidency the company's physical plant was enormously expanded	and the length and breadth of the brown + sharpe machine tool	line became the greatest in the world.	8.234763109989746
6698. during the early part of this	century the brown + sharpe works in providence were unchallenged	as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to	precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world.	12.226865256473316
6699. during these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets	laid down by mr brown.	12.23648868965027
6700. it expanded from hand screw machines	to automatic screw machines from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines	to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing	business from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to	a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type	milling machines.	9.116328473445664
6701. in the grinding machine field expansion went far	from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface	grinders and a wide variety of special and semi-special models.	10.025360777648663
6702. in 1951 henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and	continued	the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working	equipment business.	13.22900151590984
6703. the company is still broadening its line and	is now active on four major fronts.	11.155794075537496
6704. the machine tool division	is currently producing brown + sharpe single spindle automatic screw	machines grinding machines of many types and knee and bed-type	milling machines.	10.002420989471982
6705. recently added is the brown + sharpe turret drilling	machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool	development.	8.469502572884027
6706. in the industrial products division the company	manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection	equipment machinists' tools- including micrometers vernier	calipers and accessories.	10.980975046643774
6707. in the cutting tool division	the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling	cutters end mills and saws.	11.497787447509404
6708. sales and net income for the year ended december 31 1960 showed an	improvement over 1959.	11.56850266326969
6709. net income was $2557111 or $3.	13.609978613797669
6710. 11 per share	on 821220 common shares currently outstanding as compared to $2323867	or $2.	10.358652090748608
6711. 82 per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares.	12.781891317460722
6712. sales and other operating income increased 25.	13.037321475654965
6713. 1% from $24926615	in 1959 to $31179816 in 1960.	10.530932308755343
6714. this increase was sufficient to	overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and	increased expenditures on research and development.	10.550574306815017
6715. in spite	of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected	substantially by the current decline in business activity we have	been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960	at a rate materially higher than during 1959.	8.551829191403485
6716. year	our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and	unless this trend can be reversed our production for 1961 will be lower	than for 1960.	9.067115710793145
6717. however the healthy inventory position of	the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that	improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961.	11.541851954542572
6718. in connection with our continuing	development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u	s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling	the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic	basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesona's	business in the next few years.	9.631297639375768
6719. such a depreciation policy would	also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the	competitive position of the u s textile and other industries	thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange.	12.192707255003656
6720. our research and development program	serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost	production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis	at leesona.	0.0
6721. this program is based on the policy of designing	and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile	values- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility	provide the consumer with better textile products for the money.	9.634534749864875
6722. such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing	mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility.	12.537773030127076
6723. but more important	we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely	new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and	our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine.	9.554389950032304
6724. on this basis our already substantial budget for research and	development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance	the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesona's	future growth in sales and earnings.	11.079984465531915
6725. much of this necessary	increase in research and development though properly chargeable to	current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed	and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of	several years.	10.160644798903705
6726. in december we began to	ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines.	14.93878135815493
6727. these machines produce	the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured	fabrics.	9.775343801927475
6728. during the past year great progress has been made by	the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics.	17.359231758769784
6729. fashion	centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and	improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics.	7.811867791937725
6730. this machine operating at speeds up to 350000 revolutions	per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations	in industry today.	12.983343400439292
6731. it transfers yarn directly from the producers'	largest package into ideal supply packages for use on unifil loom	winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics.	9.374113263794747
6732. our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing	well in our customers' mills.	10.54197857609304
6733. later in the year additional types	of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other	man-made fibers and natural yarns.	12.040018990384246
6734. these machines are designed to provide	higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility	of application to different types of yarn.	11.532587301821676
6735. this we believe will	substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment.	12.993941511256484
6736. major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled	completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic	coning machine.	10.371128011716554
6737. this work is progressing on schedule and we expect to	make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year.	10.909154667622097
6738. this machine	was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and	was well received by the industry.	13.05252587691908
6739. the potential market for the machine	should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder.	12.918557773721508
6740. the	uniconer has several outstanding features- it operates with much	greater efficiency than existing equipment; it incorporates an automatic	knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in	the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end	is exhausted.	8.49529490330463
6741. because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a	relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation	provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile	production at the same time upgrading quality.	9.644149615779131
6742. many mills have already	placed firm orders for this machine.	14.116321443953554
6743. a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling	for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment.	9.693265344290788
6744. machines	a new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate	the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic	yarns.	10.522299039044025
6745. it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to	hold precise tension and speed.	16.457740815224653
6746. this new machine takes up filament	yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds	up to 6000 feet per minute.	10.761139328463498
6747. it is equipped with an automatic threading	device to reduce waste and handling time.	17.188124262963882
6748. our take-up machines	and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing	for application with new high polymer yarns in several fiber producing	plants.	9.487332935537388
6749. we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding	field.	15.055950008614664
6750. we are interested in further diversification	into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial	products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction.	10.975718676002144
6751. our patterson moos research	division has made further very encouraging progress in development of	fuel cells.	9.212581032246536
6752. the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt	+ whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation	has been important in this work.	10.598666299105574
6753. in addition to its major effort on fuel	cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry	on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department	other government agencies and for our own account.	9.748407943904178
6754. pmr	is currently supplying components vital to the titan and minuteman	programs.	12.119060878322763
6755. we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie	generale de telegraphie sans fil of france for	the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials.	9.537367886102787
6756. the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing	of such materials in the united states.	14.69656490775156
6757. initially we will import the	thermoelectric materials and modules from france but later we will	manufacture in this country.	8.21143988341501
6758. there is a rapidly growing demand for this	material primarily from the military.	22.07673355500511
6759. further research we believe	will develop important commercial applications.	11.474859965212314
6760. a project for	the air force has been completed in which the nair infrared	detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous	gases.	10.597937594533452
6761. we are initiating research on the use of solid state	materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require	cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity.	9.762790804626132
6762. the rapid	advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation.	12.957840546200554
6763. our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development	those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities.	8.145653505631783
6764. early in august we broke ground	for a new $3500000 plant in warwick rhode island which will house	our textile and coil winding machinery operations.	10.337967289334943
6765. construction is	well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of	this year.	9.266406483345829
6766. all operations now carried on at our plant at cranston will	be transferred to warwick.	11.624899770272005
6767. operations in the new plant should be	producing efficiently early in 1962.	10.829505516904343
6768. an architect's sketch	of the new plant is shown on the front cover.	13.394136458439329
6769. the building will contain	430000 square feet approximately the same as our present plant.	11.622762941893921
6770. however	its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production	capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially	reduce current repair and maintenance costs.	9.902244203311184
6771. a major consideration	in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was	the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly	skilled work force.	10.01205230088331
6772. we have entered into an agreement for the	sale of the present cranston properties effective as soon as we have	completed removal to our new plant.	12.835021031978624
6773. during	the year our british subsidiary leesona-holt limited expanded	its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity.	8.51756835771507
6774. the	operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesona's former operations	in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant	in the adjoining town of heywood.	8.777324869432913
6775. layout and equipment were modernized	and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis.	8.62963042412541
6776. the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size	of the former rochdale and manchester locations.	12.076670445350091
6777. in addition land	has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future.	16.286338422202352
6778. the new warwick plant is being built	at our expense and under our direction.	13.420431847658831
6779. it will be transfered on	completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a non-profit	organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction.	12.585864908419323
6780. we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase.	13.627622882803255
6781. these arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to leesona.	11.385936387311666
6782. interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short	term loan from the chase manhattan bank.	10.125879532997674
6783. in addition to expenditures	on the warwick plant we have invested approximately $1961000	for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery	plant and equipment at leesona-holt limited.	10.812001423236792
6784. we believe that these	improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which	will fully justify the investment.	13.461272447435297
6785. long term loans have been	reduced by $395000 to $2461000.	13.595479304289531
6786. inventories increased $625561 to	$8313514 during the year and should decline in coming months.	12.526055398170822
6787. thus	we enter 1961 in a strong financial position.	10.530932308755343
6788. in accordance with the two-year contract signed in may 1959 with	the international association of machinists afl-cio wages	of hourly employees were increased by 4% in may 1960 and pay levels	for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately.	10.351692472176985
6789. in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their dependents	was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital	accommodations.	11.159543923350752
6790. in addition to direct salaries	and wages the company paid or accrued during the year the following	amounts for the benefit of employees:    during the pension	year ended december 31 1960 23 employees retired making a total	of 171 currently retired under the company's pension plan.	11.753329174153313
6791. at	december 13 1960 the fund held by the industrial national bank of	providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions	to qualified members of the plan totaled $2412616.	8.569283661554616
6792. the basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of	the population that began 20 years ago.	12.02693549509071
6793. another growth factor is increased	consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics	that go with a rising standard of living.	8.066200373475011
6794. as in many other	industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and	foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry	in recent years.	11.725119078938283
6795. in textiles as elsewhere	a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and	higher productivity.	13.601124686558515
6796. as a designer and manufacturer of textile	production machinery leesona and other companies in its industry have	sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods	that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility.	9.40077983457555
6797. the problem of efficient	production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves	large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel	or home decoration.	11.073416458244264
6798. production must be adjusted accordingly at	minimum cost and quickly.	11.793662721363662
6799. in addition production machinery must	in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural	fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends.	11.226609519359554
6800. following the term of service in japan each emissary returns for a	brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college	community.	10.953759832794928

6891. week-end activities for the entire	campus are planned by the co-op board.	9.345058977386529
6892. in recent months much attention has been given to the probable	extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat	divided as to the outlook for the near future.	13.124502048245562
6893. and yet despite some	disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new	decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures	of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole.	10.176005965936906
6894. the	shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the	present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has	prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized	many previous swings in the business cycle.	11.208404538925953
6895. this caution	has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors	to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact	stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because	of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level.	8.018456095511068
6896. in	the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories	of tv sets.	11.677228063474185
6897. factory stocks in recent months have been the	highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below	1959.	10.405380809049037
6898. the total value of our industry's shipments at factory prices	increased from $9.	13.456289063716659
6899. 2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.	14.654916068530095
6900. 1 billion	as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business-	home entertainment military industrial and replacement.	15.197290832047422
6901. i believe	a further gain is in prospect for 1961.	13.319440967794202
6902. up	reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as	consoles and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment	electronics in 1960 was about $1.	8.860944413918231
6903. 9 billion compared to $1.	13.981431186566345
6904. sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months	of 1959 through july; set production	also ran ahead in the early months but was curtailed	after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence	that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic.	10.282226773352646
6905. for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came	to 5.	15.711850977810844
6906. 7 million in 1959; however production came	to only 5.	13.474507479147913
6907. 6 million compared to 6.	13.663406256419398
6908. in contrast to the	lower turnout of tv total radio production increased from 15.	15.914160834864521
6909. 4	million sets to 16.	14.19641732877796
6910. both home and auto	radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead	of 1959 in every month of the first eleven; sales and production of	home sets were about equal at 10.	9.579449803568448
6911. auto set production	came to about 6.	11.867291106449708
6912. 3 million compared to 5.	20.160372938460274
6913. separate	phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of	stereo	sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade	that characterized the radio-tv market.	10.882108730659565
6914. the outlook	for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present	but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers	to step up their buying plans for durable goods.	10.891901702159098
6915. i would expect that	sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some	10-15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison	with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business	conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will.	10.20971993905613
6916. i	look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.	10.635267499930531
6917. 7	million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from	the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.	8.266264097402926
6918. i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop	in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.	11.656188952968495
6919. 8	million slightly below 1960 but above 1959.	11.118618003375188
6920. to grow	1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's	shipments of military electronics which totalled about $5.	11.442874694680068
6921. 4 billion	compared to $4.	17.500626603105413
6922. it is interesting to note that	the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than	the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 which were good	years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period	of rapid consumer acceptance.	10.184171211601045
6923. it has been correctly pointed out by well-informed	people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to	expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized	the decade of the 1950's and that our military markets	may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons	systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas	of our defense capability.	8.612759315231143
6924. while this may well be true in general i	believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments	suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be	one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding	rapidly in other directions.	10.156150825915207
6925. among the items scheduled	for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b70	programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic	air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems.	0.0
6926. research	and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite	samos and the future development of ballistic missile	defense systems such as nike-zeus are expected to increase substantially.	10.080255198040946
6927. research development test and evaluation funds devoted	to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft	and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement	by 1963.	7.958705388343163
6928. still later the realm of space technology will show	substantial gains; it has been estimated that spending by the national	aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than	$500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 and that	the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer	to 50% than the current 20%.	8.789628195641042
6929. the stepped up defense procurement	called for in the 1961 budget has already begun to make itself	felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and	the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional	$2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested	for fiscal 1962.	8.362988332678515
6930. although the impact of these increases on our industry's	shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good	increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $6 billion.	0.0
6931. electronic equipment	paced by the continuing rapid growth	of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic	equipment totalled $1.	8.790701476788914
6932. 8 billion compared to $1.	18.699008690942197
6933. the market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand	at the rate of about 30% annually reaching some $450 million in	1960.	9.237991029205283
6934. informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple	by the late 1960's under the stimulus of new applications in	the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information	storage and retrieval.	8.339227866400645
6935. in the industrial field prospects	for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment	are also quite bright.	11.347168302294769
6936. for the near term however it must be realized	that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive	to general business conditions than is the military market and for this	reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller	than those of recent years; sales should slightly exceed 1960 however	and reach $1.	8.890679773661455
6937. in addition to	the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business	the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues	year by year.	10.460672799683465
6938. this is now a $1.	32.46393678960074
6939. 0 billion business up from $0.	11.867291106449708
6940. 9 billion	in 1959 and should reach $1.	13.575937806513588
6941. the markets	for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of	the various end equipment segments of the industry.	8.828385447606417
6942. demand for parts	for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were	cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced	their own operating rates.	10.14810197469997
6943. in the military field incoming orders turned	down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall	when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt	in rising orders for components.	10.18561372543662
6944. sales of transistors in 1960	exceeded $300 million compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial	price reductions in virtually all types.	9.159936216703418
6945. production totalled about	123 million units against 82 million in 1959 and i look for a further	gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961.	8.300915794117344
6946. sales of passive components such as capacitors and resistors although	not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of	1959 this year and should increase again in 1961.	9.162866165339619
6947. in sum i	look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with	total sales increasing about 7% to $10.	9.96834619455293
6948. 8 billion despite the uncertainties	in the business outlook generally.	13.694473218483978
6949. as i have indicated above	i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market	for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of	the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on	to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects	for continued increases in defense spending; and on continued growth	in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing	and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.	7.798704382698253
6950. the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager	of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading	manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical	controls has been announced by david b peck vice president	special products.	10.371188098061493
6951. mr devey will be responsible for the	commercial expansion of vectrol's line of electronic and electrical	power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers	working closely with walter j brown president and director	of engineering of the recently acquired sprague subsidiary.	7.308680250719062
6952. mr	brown will at the same time undertake expansion of vectrol's custom	design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased	engineering staff.	11.138736169412995
6953. mr devey's new responsibilities are	in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of	sprague's special products group which manufactures a wide line	of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and	high temperature magnet wires.	8.129771736823663
6954. mr devey first came to sprague	in 1953 as a product specialist in the field engineering department	coming from the office of naval research in washington d	c where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare	studies.	10.497194434329039

6958. mr devey is a member of the institute	of radio engineers and is chairman of the electronic industries association	committee p-9 on printed and modular components.	15.310353934489825
6959. mr brown well-known english-born inventor prior to founding	vectrol was at various times section leader in radio research at	metropolitan vickers electrical co ltd; chief engineer	of the radio set division of electric and musical industries ltd	the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in great britain;	director of engineering at philco of great britain ltd and	vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president	at the brush development co cleveland ohio.	6.906475385916051
6960. he has a bachelor	of science from the university of manchester england.	21.090093134927226
6961. mr	brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923.	8.834168570742513
6962. he is a fellow of the american institute of electrical engineers	and a senior member of the institute of radio engineers.	17.95842500841572
6963. he	is a member of the institution of electrical engineers london a	registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio and a chartered	electrical engineer in great britain.	10.262506620266949
6964. the promotion of robert e swift to the position of assistant	manager of the interference control field service department	was announced early in december by frederick s scarborough	manager of interference control field service.	9.8140889081348
6965. the appointment was	made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers	of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability	problems.	10.06903129142662
6966. between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters.	13.197394827863333
6967. since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential	aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both	jobs.	10.297490061613567
6968. since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals	rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is	proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing	in the decisions that govern its course.	9.969842942386489
6969. the faculty	believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching	and scholarship.	11.088794059303522
6970. the president expects faculty members to remember	in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility	for the university's income nor are they personally accountable	for top-level decisions.	10.552084601106309
6971. he may welcome their appropriate participation	in the determination of high policy but he has a right to	expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the	administration.	10.177211840318872
6972. how well do faculty members govern themselves?	21.180548006999295
6973. 	there is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought	to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in	government.	8.836065776167137
6974. they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than	to their own internal problems of government.	12.278301081853314
6975. they too need to learn	to delegate.	21.416561049623652
6976. letting the administration take details off their hands	would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a	whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention.	9.01586446085065
6977. although	faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige	to a member who actively participates in college or university	government.	8.026882005052693
6978. there are nevertheless several things that the president	can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those	who are willing to exercise their privilege.	13.558932233645178
6979. he can for example	present significant university-wide issues to the senate.	14.205982182204066
6980. he can encourage	quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to	it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as	well as the action-oriented faculty; by making certain that no faculty	member has too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison	between the committees and the administration; by minimizing the	number of committees.	8.961203674350529
6981. despite the many avenues for the exchange	of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack	of communication persist.	9.552706491355512
6982. the cause is as often neglect as hesitance	to disclose.	14.310793878502059
6983. a busy president conversant with a problem and its ramifications	and beset by pressures to meet deadlines tends naturally to	assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is.	7.658887938677735
6984. the	need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all	methods of consultation.	10.278872163761433
6985. to increase faculty influence and decrease	tension many presidents have established a standing advisory	committee with which they can discuss problems frankly.	10.353934935875303
6986. the president	has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes but if	he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw	out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can	also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take.	10.01882961249648
6987. success	will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and	persistence.	10.057988591011652
6988. the critical task for every president and his	academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university	continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance	will match changing social demands h great professors do not automatically	reproduce themselves.	9.123470614752504
6989. deans can form an important bridge	between the president and the faculty.	11.899597251443236
6990. they serve not only as spokesmen	for their areas but they also contribute to top-level decision	making.	13.436365909927197
6991. the president who appoints strong men who have an all-college	or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration	can count on useful assistance.	10.810124899611989
6992. faculty members depend on	their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration.	10.358652090748608
6993. the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen	for strategic aid in building stronger departments.	14.542864855723751
6994. one way that this	can be done other than by hiring new high-priced professors is by constantly	encouraging the department members to raise their standards	of performance.	11.461172068083576
6995. the quality of a president's leadership is	measured first by his success in building up the faculty.	11.10327347799234
6996. by supporting	the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever	higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership.	12.196046656431044
6997. indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for	appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to.	7.719095379114949
6998. the academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty	development.	13.6413735903419
6999. an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel	needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job	and bright prospects elsewhere.	9.394718411596463
7000. for the maintenance of a long-term	program the departments and particularly their chairmen are	strategic.	16.62105366665757
7001. they evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and	promotion.	13.591145231254554
7002. to provide an independent judgment for the president the	academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly.	11.749419108229892
7003. at some	colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports	to the administration on the qualifications of candidates.	9.738694549834424
7004. some faculty	members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because	they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma.	10.324125400517442
7005. they	can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates	and devote substantial time to the work.	8.026882005052693
7006. at one university	the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner	of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the	faculty.	12.994467001329737
7007. before the president recommends a candidate to the	trustees the administration collects the views of colleagues in the	same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere.	9.900878302688586
7008. the president or dean	reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation	of the quality of his mind.	14.242064929497671
7009. no good way to evaluate teaching ability	has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets	for a list of criteria.	9.798286149829659
7010. to avoid passing over quiet unaggressive	teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review	of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should	be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for	advancement by their departments.	11.186264297654349
7011. there are certain aspects of	personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly.	15.002304288709311
7012. he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member	proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly	serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements.	10.614850516279654
7013. no one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older	men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to	their specialties is quite different.	9.35571131729191
7014. in particular the president	may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members	to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale.	10.487540043510378
7015. on	those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the	standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate	burden of decision and action.	8.097733225328785
7016. a true university like most	successful marriages is a unity of diversities h without forcing	all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan	is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest	level which a university- in contrast to a multiversity- should	stand for.	9.018525908732675
7017. recently colleges and universities have begun	to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals.	0.0
7018. each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as:	shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core	for all undergraduates?	10.278900140167488
7019.  or shall we permit early specialization in	scientific and technological subjects?	11.76182168428188
7020.  in the first instance adequate	appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be	planned.	19.474586497185648
7021. in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required.	15.621667455251627
7022. for the president a master plan looking ahead five years	offers several practical	advantages.	14.764529683428195
7023. trustees faculty and administration can consider the	consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards.	9.749195664455767
7024. physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed.	13.420908135108755
7025. proposed	new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present	and future financial fitness.	8.450640073948662
7026. more than one president has found	that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts.	14.70870446485877
7027. it inspires	confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and	to achieve them.	12.661487393665382
7028. before deciding where it is going however	a college	or university must know where it is.	14.34578883566302
7029. the first step is a comprehensive	self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination	of the two.	11.042765842666894
7030. it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization	buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in	stature and size.	14.589561747544824
7031. implementation of the master plan will inevitably	be uneven.	11.604312792294035
7032. some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically;	others may drag their feet.	12.077597585951064
7033. funds may be readily donated	for some purposes but not others.	9.986424155012855
7034. a plan must therefore be brought	up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent	planning officer.	10.90185277624836
7035. to provide the continuous flow of information	basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established	offices of institutional research.	10.437651300670238
7036. some offices have very broad	responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a university's	instructional program.	11.329871780112745
7037. their duties include evaluation of the information	collected and preparation of recommendations.	11.022172810728076
7038. more often these	offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data.	15.754002647458892
7039. h the president's opportunity for influencing education reaches	its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which	he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts.	8.022193134430319
7040. no matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget	making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents.	14.275853917675377
7041. when	the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget	to which his faith and credit are committed; its principal features	should be a product of his most considered judgment.	7.990511853339171
7042. he cannot	of course examine each proposal from scratch.	16.477994707361407
7043. he reviews and shapes	the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote	the aims of the institution.	9.660036261160776
7044. budgeting must be flexible to	allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological	scholarship.	10.552977879488086
7045. because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly	large sums of money an institution should choose its fields	of prominence.	10.25618714490991
7046. otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst	and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and	culturally indispensable branches of learning.	11.922268580129181
7047. in the national interest	even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor	among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses	in all branches.	11.065797647826225
7048. supporting activities- business	management public relations fund-raising- offer presidents one of	their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education h here	the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much	to free a president for his primary role.	8.62407661427095
7049. in the areas that	do	not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will	serve the college or university better than close presidential attention.	10.82396144438628
7050. the president should find strong subordinates and delegate the	widest discretion to them.	14.67203415395187
7051. higher education cannot compete with the	salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can	offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business	community that will offset the differences in income.	8.406421987915866
7052. just as	the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy	and objectives so should non-academic officers.	11.373105428390762
7053. they will better	understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program	and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of	mutual goals.	11.36052465617011
7054. a president is frequently besieged to serve in	non-academic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay	groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus.	10.685156072981178
7055. since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed	by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations.	9.716692206067727
7056. declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains	why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance.	9.559225930701576
7057. by sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues	the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to	create a public perception of the university as an institution something	more than the lengthened shadow of one man.	8.49651560670459
7058. it has recently become practical to use the	radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information	about these bodies and their atmospheres.	12.744952019855319
7059. the results of present observations	of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with	the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived	from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses	.	8.441525329057413
7060. when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements	are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal	and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials	of the moon.	10.947480131905102
7061. observations of the radio emission of a planet	which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater	extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases	give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics	of the solid surface.	7.145093857896968
7062. radio observations of venus and jupiter have	already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions	of these planets.	11.541507868946683
7063. the observed intensity of the radio emission of	venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity although the	spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and	1o cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo` k.	8.252317097651158
7064. this result	suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet	although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be	a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the	observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence.	10.45637808092411
7065. for	the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like	the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seems very likely that	the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation	from the atmosphere and non-thermal components.	7.589591346138123
7066. of the remaining	planets only mars and saturn have been observed as radio sources	and not very much information is available.	12.014100819552848
7067. mars has been observed	twice at about 3-cm wave length and the intensity of the observed	radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which	might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of mars.	8.162315066654749
7068. the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observations	but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal	origin.	11.006863256042703
7069. no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining	planets have been reported and because of their distances small	diameters or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths	reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very	low intensity.	9.081728533801066
7070. in spite of this the very large radio reflectors and	improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should	make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets	in a few years.	12.10963773578497
7071. the study of the radio emission of the moon	and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon	at 1.	12.596287178507753
7072. 25-cm wave length by dicke and beringer.	13.037321475654965
7073. this was	followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.	11.28868602154132
7074. 25-cm	emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by piddington and minnett	.	11.597841447637746
7075. they deduced from their measurements that the radio emission	from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly	sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably	less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission	as measured by pettit and nicholson;	and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-12 days after	full	moon which is again in contrast to the infrared emission which reaches	its maximum at full moon.	7.213373089591529
7076. piddington and minnett explained	their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely	to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent	to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation.	10.928964628505279
7077. the infrared	emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon	while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface	where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced	in amplitude and shifted in phase.	8.163758222309843
7078. since the absorption of radio waves	in rocklike material varies with wave length it should be possible	to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface	and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the	lunar surface material.	9.5191942547028
7079. the radio emission of a planet was	first detected in 1955 when burke and franklin identified the	origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15	meters wave length as emission from jupiter.	7.98423808682447
7080. this sporadic type of	planetary radiation is discussed by burke and gallet	.	13.236737574390107
7081. steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was	observed from venus at 3.	8.834168570742513
7082. 4 cm and from mars and jupiter	at 3.	14.19670681060324
7083. 15 cm in 1956	and from saturn at 3.	10.860837018830757
7084. 75 cm in 1957	.	17.434561775113806
7085. in the relatively short time since these early observations	venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from	0.	10.144875890468164
7086. 2 cm and jupiter has been observed over the wave-length	range from 3.	12.609447510967088
7087. the observable characteristics of	planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the	direction of arrival of the waves.	8.998955821926716
7088. the maximum angular diameter of	any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc.	10.551876137849225
7089. this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very	large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission	of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved.	9.562158089400938
7090. it should	be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio	sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers.	11.08299120998455
7091. measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity	and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the	planetary radiation at the earth.	8.18182507659557
7092. there have been few measurements specifically	for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation.	19.177398912897083
7093. the measurements made with the nrl 50-foot reflector	which is altitude-azimuth-mounted would have shown a systematic change	with local hour angle in the measured intensities of venus and jupiter	if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized.	8.316722027230588
7094. recent interferometer measurements	have shown the 960-mc emission of jupiter to be partially	polarized	and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible	disk.	9.781632829737031
7095. other than this very significant result most of the information	now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted	to the intensity of the radiation.	8.487262251156995
7096. the concept of apparent	black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from	the moon and the planets.	15.052873959572166
7097. the received radiation is compared with the	radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid	angle as the visible disk of the planet.	8.18901342307388
7098. the apparent black-body	disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the	black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that	of the observed radiation.	10.561191715767016
7099. the use of this concept does not specify	the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates	as a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond	to the physical temperature of the emitting material.	8.55628574761116
7100. the radio	radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should	be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter	wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar	radio noise.	8.99860236604713
7101. the quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation	would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less	than 1` k.	8.998955821926716
7102. at meter wave lengths and increase of the order of	10` k in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would	be expected.	12.170124863118888
7103. therefore neglecting the extreme outbursts reflected	solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements	of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length	range.	8.988956359708466
7104. radio observations	of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.	14.673065557626568
7105. 3 mm	to 75 cm and the results are summarized in table 1.	11.381099552923361
7106. observations	have also been made at 1.	15.414979738583925
7107. 5 mm using optical techniques	.	19.85960171961108
7108. not all the observers have used	the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness	distribution when reducing the data and this together with	differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers	must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness	temperatures.	10.155593360335622
7109. in the observations at 4.	25.798020808256386
7110. 3 mm	the diameter of the antenna beam 6'.	16.699139230332868
7111. 7 was small enough	to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface	and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution	at three lunar phases.	11.784625582625097
7112. these observations indicate that the lunar	maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do	the mountainous regions.	9.840910608950786
7113. mare imbrium seems to be an exception and	remains cooler than the regions which surround it.	10.226140954077309
7114. these contour diagrams	also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with	latitude.	11.46224284727585
7115. very recently observations have been made at 8-mm	wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant	beam width of only about 2'	.	8.769013887745691
7116. the constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those	observed at 4.	13.569310574206803
7117. 3 mm by coates and apparently the emission	at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface	features.	8.868763096989959
7118. such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several	wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can	be properly	interpreted.	11.562588789299342
7119. the observations of mayer mccullough	and sloanaker at 3.	12.98623016976681
7120. 15 cm and of sloanaker at 10.	13.483502230391252
7121. 3 cm have not	previously	been published and will be briefly described.	13.334259382904596
7122. 15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval may 3	to june 19 1956 using the 50-foot reflector at the u s naval	research laboratory in washington.	10.735326757445518
7123. the half-intensity diameter	of the antenna beam was about 9' and the angle subtended by the moon	included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes.	9.370144489791423
7124. the	antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both	measured so that	the	absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle	of the moon was known.	9.123830587761875
7125. the ratio of the measured antenna temperature	change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature	of the moon over the antenna beam	was found by graphical integration	of the antenna directivity diagram to be 0.	7.546641295900295
7126. the measured	brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature	at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna	beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion	of the moon's disk is nearly uniform.	11.008948687311678
7127. the result of the observations	is f where the phase angle |qt is measured	in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute	as well as relative errors.	10.328592008039125
7128. this result is plotted along with the 8.	18.290163779918153
7129. 6-mm	observations of gibson in figure 1 a.	11.118618003375188
7130. the variation	in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much	less than the variation in the 8.	10.776715553015368
7131. 6-mm emission as would be expected	from the explanation of piddington and minnett.	9.070074471681158
7132. in the discussion	which follows the time average of the radio emission will be	referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic	variation will be called the variable component.	10.827361998695597
7133. 3-cm	observation of sloanaker was made on may 20 1958 using the	84-foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the u	s naval research laboratory.	7.556878632736834
7134. the age of the moon was about 2	days.	19.872538563786115
7135. the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was	about 18'.	12.609363080288524
7136. 5 and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming	a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for	the moon.	10.407531990444394
7137. experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous	graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas.	8.29272515769823
7138. thus the	energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into	the arc.	11.057874562640393
7139. it was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss	of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the	total arc energy a detailed energy balance of the anode was established.	9.451939416166258
7140. the anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount.	18.132911305128204
7141. the dependence	of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating	gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between	100 amp and 200 amp.	8.27425730033199
7142. qualitative observations were made and	high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the	arc at various mass flow velocities.	9.159936216703418
7143. the high heat	fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate	extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation.	10.523674005895941
7144. the cooling requirements	are particularly severe at the anode.	15.227221353292695
7145. in free burning electric	arcs for instance approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred	to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of	f as measured by the authors- the exact value depending on the arc	atmosphere.	8.15861915858892
7146. in plasma generators as currently commercially available	for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than	50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the co0ling	medium of the anode.	9.843864423210972
7147. the higher heat transfer rates at the anode	compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical	phenomena occurring in free burning arcs.	9.576736697071984
7148. in plasma generators the	superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat.	14.174449266743885
7149. the heat	transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1.	13.771085206143976
7150. heat	of condensation plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging	on the anode.	10.957705180640192
7151. this energy transfer depends on the current the	temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions	in the anode sheath.	9.739751097545792
7152. heat transfer by molecular conduction as well	as by radiation from the arc column.	10.550898587259717
7153. the heat transfer to	the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from	the cathode towards the anode with velocities up f.	8.197614673473888
7154. this phenomenon	has been experimentally investigated in detail by maecker	.	14.666783238248009
7155. the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the	magnetic field in the arc	.	15.399089633120147
7156. hence the flow conditions at the anode of free	burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point.	11.791527870581819
7157. it is apparent	from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements	for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with	those for the cathode.	10.142795113481844
7158. the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify	these conditions; however the anode is still the part receiving	the largest heat flux.	10.951222191930302
7159. an attempt to improve the life of the anodes	or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at	a reduction of the anode loss.	10.27094378511282
7160. the following possibilities exist for	achieving this: 1.	18.43958767319159
7161. the use of high voltages and low currents by proper	design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given	power output.	9.548243461765395
7162. continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode	by flow or magnetic forces.	10.23294824414389
7163. feed back of the energy transferred	to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode.	10.096308098400353
7164. the third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for the	first time by c sheer and co-workers.	13.972026857148693
7165. the purpose of	the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish	an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect	of blowing on the arc voltage.	9.433384028542411
7166. gas injection through a porous anode	not only feeds back the energy transferred	to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions	in the arc itself.	8.944329220900824
7167. a detailed study of this latter phenomenon	was not attempted in this paper.	10.30958330947291
7168. argon was used as a blowing gas to	exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction.	12.109129107062502
7169. the anode	material was porous graphite.	16.994033841028205
7170. sintered porous metals should be usable	in principle.	13.037321475654965
7171. however technical difficulties arise by melting at local	hot spots.	12.141374508485978
7172. the experimental arrangement as described below is based	on the geometry of free burning arcs.	12.199018492189309
7173. thus direct comparisons can	be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during	the past years and decades by numerous investigators.	8.615922849087879
7174. figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic	views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode	holder.	9.159936216703418
7175. the cathode consisted of a 14'' diameter thoriated tungsten	rod attached to a water cooled copper tube.	9.807189848231515
7176. this tube could be	adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the	required electrode spacing.	11.180928482489401
7177. the anode in figure 2 was mounted by means	of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk.	8.535996319710994
7178. the	transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially	towards the cathode below.	10.11881746645696
7179. inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere	was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2.	8.48618656922105
7180. argon was also	blown at low velocities through a tube coaxial	with	the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the	arc by air.	9.051154372622117
7181. the anode consisted of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite	plug 14 inch long.	10.761390730989845
7182. the graphite was national carbon nc	60 which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 this	small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving	the anode.	9.180020345648183
7183. the anode plug was inserted into a carbon	anode holder.	12.204673387645432
7184. a shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream	temperature of the transpiring gas.	14.682190090406031
7185. it was exposed to a high velocity	gas jet.	21.806435865059278
7186. a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided	the chamber above the porous plug into two parts.	9.976524862873173
7187. this arrangement	had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by	natural convection.	11.120434022336902
7188. two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2	served for simultaneous measurement of	the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along	the anode holder.	9.543738616748717
7189. three thermocouples were placed at different locations	in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its	temperature.	9.139904230977155
7190. another anode holder used in the experiments is shown	in figure 3.	13.738447406896437
7191. in this design the anode holder is water cooled and	the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring	the temperature rise of the coolant.	9.584337342654337
7192. to reduce heat transfer from	the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon	shield was attached tothe surface providing an air gap of 116	inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder.	9.77308098157711
7193. in addition	the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil	to reduce radiation.	12.129103256214078
7194. temperatures of the shield and of the surface	of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account	for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode	plug.	9.540119122922215
7195. the argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated	by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator.	9.341088212809698
7196. the power	source was a commercial d c rectifier.	15.227221353292695
7197. at 100 amp the	360 cycle ripple was less than 0.	12.624949301740195
7198. 5 v with a resistive	load.	23.28670810692865
7199. the current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and	measured with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter.	10.730509960333407
7200. the arc voltage	was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode	and cathode holders.	11.488689464864123
7201. because of the falling characteristic of the	rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation.	13.169092703863464
7202. a high frequency starter was used to start the arc.	16.51015764543132
7203. procedure and error analysis	_1.	14.19641732877796
7204. transpiration cooled anode with	the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed	with two goals in mind.	9.723773562266802
7205. the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced	as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat	balance can be made.	9.960180737675252
7206. in order to reduce the number of variable parameters	all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.	16.84118903560228
7207. 5''	and a current of 100 amp.	11.867291106449708
7208. the argon flow through the porous anode	was varied systematically between f.	12.957840546200554
7209. the lower limit	was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started	to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug	and that it became highly unstable.	9.017455867395439
7210. the upper limit was determined by	the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature	since only a small region of the anode was struck by the	arc.	9.923976444371773
7211. this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the	anode surface changed size and location continuously.	12.182315078124573
7212. for each	mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured.	14.943161474898726
7213. to measure the surface	temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer.	11.344091367937802
7214. as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug.	21.028218398817984
7215. its temperature	was denoted by f.	14.57117964671506
7216. the size of this hot region was estimated	by eye.	23.832974834320147
7217. the rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards	the outer diameter of the plug.	13.767638729082309
7218. the mean temperature of this region	was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the	edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug.	9.602164633469624
7219. it was denoted by f.	30.904122386255487
7220. the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to	the following relation: f where x is the fraction of the plug area	covered by the hot spot.	9.591283174148115
7221. assuming thermal equilibrium between the	anode surface and the transpiring argon the gas enthalpy rise through	the anode was calculated according to the relation f whereby the specific	heat of argon was taken as f.	7.6443760161527905
7222. this calculation results in	an	enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally	distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass	velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.	9.584848211266216
7223. the upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple	shown in figure 2 was f.	10.242653103537407
7224. the f values are listed in table 1	together	with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages.	11.536112936634531
7225. simultaneously	with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer	readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode	holder as indicated on figure 2.	8.081648018519873
7226. some of these temperatures are plotted	in figure 4.	23.25580014657967
7227. they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate	within the accuracy of these measurements.	13.240780072072212
7228. thus the dotted line shown	in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for	all blowing rates.	11.365391386226362
7229. the thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown	in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of	f.	9.189554574368655
7230. this temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which	the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned.	11.666612896958698
7231. it	is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode	holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward	the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements.	9.487848351745853
7232. the reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder	and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also	be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces	and of the specific geometry.	10.579250780043779
7233. the total heat loss through the anode	holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical	piece into the adjacent metal parts.	9.640681629986016
7234. it was calculated from the	temperature gradient f at f inch as f.	17.422203738568914
7235. the total heat flux from	the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby f the temperature	distribution of figure 4 gives f for all blowing rates assuming f.	8.245206785023827
7236. the temperature dependent value of |e was taken from ref	7.	14.131605150252852
7237. the radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to	f where f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures f	and f calculated analogously to equation.	8.740905451858895
7238. a band viscometer is shown in figure 2.	18.635873179024852
7239. it consists of two blocks	with flat surfaces held apart by shims.	17.35627838807679
7240. there is a small well in	the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed.	18.382589151011874
7241. a tape	of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the	fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks.	8.243158953099586
7242. in	normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull	the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks.	11.212205361765832
7243. after it	has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known	distance is recorded.	11.631289171578754
7244. by the use of various weights data for a force-rate	of shear graph can be obtained.	14.972497867572779
7245. the instrument used for this	work was a slight modification of that previously described.	10.242653103537407
7246. in	this test a f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and	pulley at a rate of f with a clearance of 0.	10.249986732088232
7247. 002'' on each side of	the tape.	15.27570505724882
7248. this gives a rate of shear of f.	23.577851872083787
7249. this however can only	be considered	approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the	build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley	during the runs.	8.651327976846721
7250. the face of one block contained a hole 116''	in diameter which led to a	manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.	11.984747810028223
7251. although	there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were	two distinct types.	9.367881756719601
7252. two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure	when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures	which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures	generated by the other two.	11.991686161888168
7253. figure 3 shows the data on	a silicone fluid labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal	pressure.	8.1523940120599
7254. although the tape was run for over 1 hr a steady	state was not reached and it was concluded that the reason for this was	that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material	fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow	rate.	10.77230966276907
7255. a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of	the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure	were to be made in a reasonable time.	11.233265297118443
7256. a back pressure was then introduced	and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated	which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure.	11.070810315764804
7257. by this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted	by a sample of polybutene was	over half an atmosphere.	10.754459671001449
7258. the actual pressure was not determined because	the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand.	10.744351510671057
7259. the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes	with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300.	9.0221396376245
7260. these are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more	newtonian because of their lower molecular weight.	12.752577480597076
7261. the maximum suction	was 3.	19.440309286487764
7262. 25'' of test fluid measured from the top of the block	and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids.	12.677169127058999
7263. it is presumed	that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor	of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same	fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly	of the apparatus.	9.9431060332894
7264. this negative pressure is not explained by the	velocity head f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings	by several magnitudes.	11.974578365374883
7265. these experiments can be considered	exploratory only.	14.095951777047294
7266. however they do demonstrate the presence of large	normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast	by the theory in the first part of the paper.	12.820272416174024
7267. they also give information	which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument	for the measurement of the normal pressures.	13.54207268830873
7268. such an instrument would	be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well	as theoretical studies.	11.906931238058396
7269. the elasticity as a parameter of fluids	which	is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter	which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial	materials.	9.198850262501198
7270. such an instrument is expected to be especially useful	if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as	printing inks paints adhesives molten plastics and bread dough for	the elasticity is related to those various properties termed length	shortness spinnability etc which are usually judged	by subjective methods at present.	11.15212060460836
7271. the actual change f	caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential	times the volume just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic	pressure head.	10.453417457247811
7272. if the volume is the molal volume then f is obtained	on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists.	12.591667943744202
7273. although the f calculation is obvious by analogy with that	for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm	it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects.	8.675835649138152
7274. consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional	area of a opposed by a manometer with a height of h	and a cross-sectional area	of a.	9.380711003487045
7275. if f is the change per unit volume in gibbs function	caused by the shear field at constant p and t and |r	is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of	the system above the reference height is f.	7.484073064013415
7276. f is the work necessary	to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h.	10.513597756619538
7277. the total volume of the system above the reference height is f and	h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential	energy of the system in terms of h.	11.703095490297812
7278. the minimum total potential	energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to h	and equating to zero.	12.537225661047579
7279. this gives f which is the pressure.	20.87344283115268
7280. this	is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum	gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential	energy for equilibrium.	10.300739380639236
7281. this method can be extended to include the	concentration differences caused by shear fields.	12.14633511222647
7282. the relation between	osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be developed in an	analogous way.	13.094610608105638
7283. in the above development we have applied the thermodynamics	of equilibrium to	the steady state.	13.462398065252112
7284. this can be justified thermodynamically in this case	and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared.	16.126474021123233
7285. this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by philippoff	that the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be	applied to flowing solutions.	9.471473601085673
7286. there is one exception to the above	statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax	by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should	be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar.	12.864290532327239
7287. if the mechanics	are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also	be similar.	12.013114742461532
7288. the concept of the strain energy as a gibbs function	difference f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is	compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies	of fluids undergoing shear.	10.323294145086495
7289. essentially these birefringence studies	show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45` to	the direction of shear and as the rate of shear increases the direction	of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction	of shear.	7.527889799951739
7290. according to philippoff the recoverable shear s is	given by f where |c is the angle of extinction.	12.375568673691198
7291. from this and	the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic	energy of deformation which should be equal to the f calculated from	the pressure normal to the shearing face.	9.630220677358354
7292. there is another	means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses	in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature	and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids	in shear fields.	12.562553456363341
7293. these droplets are distorted by the normal forces	just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's	hands.	8.269200667624936
7294. these droplets appear to be ellipsoids and it is mathematically	convenient to assume that they are.	14.736405086281387
7295. if they are not ellipsoids	the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation.	21.52475312919603
7296. the direction of	the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction	of the major axis of the ellipsoids.	12.44718525536182
7297. mason and taylor both show that	the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates of shear and	that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear.	7.939289136388504
7298. this is	of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence	studies.	12.237996316355508
7299. the relative forces can be calculated from the various	radii of curvature if we assume: the surface tension is uniform	on the surface of the drop.	9.99883011800778
7300. that because of the low viscosity	of the fluid the internal pressure is the same in all directions.	13.299413482529776
7301. the kinetic effects are negligible.	16.994033841028205
7302. since the	shape of the drop conforms to the force field it does not appreciably	affect the distribution of forces in the fluid.	11.711023842629515
7303. these are reasonable	assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity	fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear.	9.168015382925445
7304. just as the pressure	exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is f and the pressure	exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is f the	pressure exerted by any curved surface is f where |g is the interfacial	tension and f and f are the two radii of curvature.	9.060452140754217
7305. this	formula is given by rumscheidt and mason.	11.118618003375188
7306. if a is the major	axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes	the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis	is f and the difference in pressure along the a and b	axes is f.	10.810138282892003
7307. there are no data published in the literature on	the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas.	12.836151129851304
7308. however	there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate	suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper	by mason and bartok.	9.051154372622117
7309. this viscosity of the material in the drops	is of course not negligible.	11.30987269845192
7310. measurements on the photograph in this	paper give f at the maximum rate of shear of f.	9.723773562266802
7311. if it is assumed	that the formula given by lodge of f cosec 2|c applies the	pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle	of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension	can be calculated.	9.173756341670515
7312. its value was f from the above data.	13.568109391227477
7313. this	appears to be high as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity	of the material in the drops.	8.1523940120599
7314. it is appropriate to call attention	to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous	to rubber-like deformation.	13.988906111898736
7315. the internal energy of an ideal	gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume.	9.583841731351152
7316. in other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant	temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted	into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink.	11.219262618190356
7317. this means that	work equals q which in turn equals f.	16.315838657667353
7318. there is a	well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that	f where \q is the probability that state	could be reached by chance alone.	12.774473763300312
7319. this is known as	conformational entropy.	27.686217044145977
7320. this conformational entropy is in this case	equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other	energies involved.	11.63887496948825
7321. note that though the ideal gas itself contains no	additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure.	8.97435326272621
7322. the energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come	as thermal energy from its surroundings.	11.39238632669359
7323. a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline f as a	function of magnetic field and temperature is presented.	8.988146053999083
7324. f is paramagnetic	and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects	lead to line broadening.	11.998810066534144
7325. the lines are asymmetric and over the	range of field f gauss and temperature f the asymmetry increases with	increasing f and decreasing t.	8.927223049409468
7326. an isotropic resonance shift	of f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine	contact interaction.	10.778841644232193
7327. the general theory of resonance shifts is used to	derive a general expression for the second moment f of a polycrystalline	paramagnetic sample and is specialized to f.	9.156627877341547
7328. the theory predicts	a linear dependence of f on f where |j is the experimentally	determined curie-weiss constant.	11.026675696446196
7329. the experimental second moment	f conforms to the relation f in agreement with theory.	10.773909915228293
7330. hence the	electron paramagnetic effects can be separated from the nuclear	effects.	13.197551318871865
7331. the paramagnetic dipole effects provide some	information on the particle shapes.	11.572314230763848
7332. the nuclear dipole effects provide	some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry	of the f bond in f remains in doubt.	9.837597303679503
7333. the	magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a	tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei.	8.658102213766103
7334. it	is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since	quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations	of structure.	9.966230810348796
7335. f appeared to be well suited for the study	of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired	electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple	and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong f bond provides	structural interest.	9.024929830157934
7336. we first discuss the f bond in f.	16.40332215830258
7337. we	then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles	with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment.	8.796191904281224
7338. indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from	nuclear effects.	21.496909254129122
7339. the information provided by the electron paramagnetic	effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted	in terms of various motional-modified models of the f bond	in f.	8.829990875858757
7340. theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond	generally agree that the f bond will be linear in the absence of	peculiarities of packing in the solid.	9.312524486475198
7341. moreover it will be asymmetric	until a certain critical f distance is reached below which it will	become symmetric.	10.06918050612486
7342. there is ample evidence from many sources that the	f bond in f is symmetric.	19.340474868355315
7343. the f distance in f is 2.	13.974661317959146
7344. there is evidence though less convincing than for f that the f	bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric.	16.504805992998328
7345. here the f distance	is 2.	22.336144017307205
7346. a number of semiempirical estimates by various workers	lead to the conclusion that the f bond becomes symmetric when the	f bond length is about 2.	12.88462726218942
7347. 5 a but aside from the possible	example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports	of symmetric f bonds.	11.461071032961241
7348. douglass has studied the crystal structure	of f by x-ray diffraction.	12.04824024138872
7349. he finds the structure contains an f	bond with the f distance of f.	11.212744175303172
7350. there is then the possibility that	this f bond is symmetric although douglass was unable to determine	its symmetry from his x-ray data.	15.079661113893051
7351. douglass found f to be	trigonal laue symmetry f with f f.	9.345058977386529
7352. x-ray and experimental	density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic	ion density of f.	10.39007490549619
7353. the x-ray data did not permit douglass	to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity	led him to assume a center of symmetry.	8.091940198210692
7354. under this assumption	the space group must be f and the following are the positions	of the atoms in the unit cell.	12.862386215306818
7355. this space group requires the hydrogen	bond to be symmetric.	12.508271769542546
7356. douglass found powder intensity calculations	and measurements to agree best for f.	10.957705180640192
7357. these data lead to a structure	in which sheets of cr atoms lie between two sheets of o	atoms.	9.603799495988738
7358. the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each cr	atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of o atoms.	10.00902523148988
7359. the f	layers are stacked normal to the 111 axis with the lower oxygens	of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower	layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers.	8.246294031693187
7360. the	separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds.	12.3482207866056
7361. a drawing of the	structure is to be found in reference 6.	18.355682290407742
7362. the gross details	of the structure appear reasonable.	16.386222825564015
7363. the structure appears to be unique	among rooh compounds but is the same as that assumed by	f.	12.569286625881515
7364. the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits	and the volume per oxygen is about normal.	10.859656698832586
7365. however the possible absence	of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off f	but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent with f at	f and f at f where f represents the oxygens	on one side of the f layers and f those on the other side.	8.535953209490687
7366. however	any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely	short f interlayer distance of 2.	10.11881746645696
7367. 55 a or the non-hydrogen-bonded	f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.	8.62963042412541
7368. hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in	this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence.	11.372521301750167
7369. the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release	the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions	along the 111 axis.	9.256494152193717
7370. if the f bond is linear then there	are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms: the hydrogen	atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the	oxygen sheets; all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet	is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other; hydrogen atoms	are asymmetrically placed either randomly or in an ordered way so	that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others	are closer to the lower oxygen atoms.	8.491474003720306
7371. position appears to us	to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on	general chemical structural grounds.	11.85232368342204
7372. a randomization of ups and	downs is more likely than ordered ups and downs in	position since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the	position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also	since ordered up and down implies a larger unit cell for	which no evidence exists.	9.140702030357984
7373. therefore the only unknown structural feature	would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically	or asymmetrically.	9.431321226778913
7374. douglass prepared his sample of f by thermal decomposition of	aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`c.	10.11881746645696
7375. dr douglass was kind enough	to lend us about 5 grams of his material.	10.620519506382909
7376. this material proved	to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on	various portions of the sample.	11.475366539285668
7377. subsequently we learned from douglass	that his sample contained a few percent f impurity.	8.834168570742513
7378. since f	is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically	contaminated f would be suspect.	10.946756482514818
7379. plane suggested another	preparation of f which we used here.	10.28210569291062
7380. 500 ml of 1m aqueous	f	with 1 g f added are heated in a bomb at 170`c for 48 hours.	9.450320846690861
7381. a very fine gray solid is formed water-washed	by centrifugation and dried at 110`c.	10.802469928742852
7382. differential thermal	analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340`c and	a large endothermic reaction at 470`c.	9.97366183335997
7383. this latter reaction is	in accord with the reported decomposition of f.	11.784617104097071
7384. thermogravimetric analysis	showed a weight loss of 1.	13.037321475654965
7385. 8% centered at 337`c and another	weight loss of 10.	10.057988591011652
7386. the expected weight loss for	f going to f and f is 10.	13.352361954146192
7387. mass spectrometric analysis of	gases evolved upon heating to 410`c indicated nitrogen oxides	and water vapor.	8.768080565580217
7388. the small reaction occurring at 337`c is probably	caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates and perhaps by a small	amount of some hydrous material other than f.	9.655840715408686
7389. all subsequent measurements	were made on material which had been heated to 375`c for	one hour.	10.725808692298266
7390. emission spectra indicated f calcium and all other impurities	much lower.	11.33819267263277
7391. 8% cr as compared	with 61.	12.851133807717682
7392. however f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and	this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight	loss.	11.25406238834106
7393. the x-ray diffraction pattern of the material taken with	cuk|a radiation indicated the presence of no extra lines and	was in good agreement with the pattern of douglass.	9.571045531788405
7394. magnetic analyses	by r g meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic	impurities.	10.957705180640192
7395. f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired	electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of f	where f.	8.65648301887914
7396. for exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would	be 3.	14.943161474898726
7397. an infrared spectrum obtained by h a benesi and	r g snyder of this laboratory showed bands in the positions	found by jones.	8.22887656506603
7398. electron microscopic examination of the f	sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.	10.648502350386371

7413. the value derived was 16 microseconds.	25.265014690262312
7414. field	shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined	as the field about which the first moment is zero.	10.218056556086722
7415. second moments	of the spectra were computed by numerical integration.	11.04478591840596
7416. corrections	were applied for modulation broadening apparatus background and	field shift.	11.793662721363662
7417. spectra were obtained over the temperature range	of 77-294`k.	10.530932308755343
7418. for the low-temperature measurements the sample was	cooled	by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and	eades.	13.518069090823824
7419. the temperature was maintained to within about f for the	period of time required to make the measurement.	10.310212220619867
7420. one sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation	at 375`c showed the presence of adsorbed water	as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow	at room temperature and which disappeared due to broadening at low	temperature.	9.627828376754186
7421. the data reported here are either from spectra from which	the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra	of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375`c which contain no	adsorbed water.	7.641768130568167
7422. the measured powder density of the f used	here was about f approximately one-third that of the crystal density	.	11.632688439971043
7423. such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of	about f.	12.112266368323835

7429. this sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to	that described above.	10.827878305075057
7430. polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants	were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates	spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates	and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited.	9.551444678102422
7431. the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse.	12.204673387645432
7432. the best	known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty spray-dried	detergent formulations for household use.	11.311263844877574
7433. these widely advertised	products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on	high-sudsing	synthetic organic actives	and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture	of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate.	7.41787420340271
7434. in the	household market there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations	based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder;	light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder; and the	dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none	of which are now nationally advertised.	10.061310595158055
7435. a well-publicized entrant	which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent	with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and	active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builderactive	ratio.	7.779756800585804
7436. hard-surface cleaning in household application is	represented by two classes of alkaline products: the formulations	made expressly for machine dishwashers and the general-purpose	cleaners used for walls and woodwork.	8.628793231021637
7437. the better quality products in	both of these lines contain phosphate builders.	11.588541694865107
7438. in addition many of	the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis	in trisodium orthophosphate which is still the major ingredient of	a number of such products.	11.537671318807684
7439. many scouring powders now also contain phosphates.	13.750506835456118
7440. these hard-surface cleaners are discussed in chapter 28.	14.252467543607985
7441. cleaning process	cleaning or detergent action is entirely	a matter of surfaces.	9.669550099771405
7442. wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid	substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or surface-active	material.	10.275148787433828
7443. an oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface	cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved.	9.448931136160429
7444. one	gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of f.	14.095402737210627
7445. in contrast a metal coupon f in size would have a magnitude from	100000 to a million less.	11.015172621747404
7446. even here there is room for some variation	for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical	reactivity.	11.20041829942327
7447. spring used a brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning	study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending	upon surface roughness.	8.184135532387398
7448. there are considerable differences between	the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning.	18.888187688000517
7449. exclusive	of esthetic values such as high- or low-foam level perfume content	etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles	are high.	7.925570784545837
7450. no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic	actives are simply not suitable for this application since they	do not give adequate soil removal.	16.102279306781025
7451. this is best demonstrated by practical	washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with	the same detergent formulation.	10.987678664162617
7452. a good formulation will keep the clothes	clean and white after many washings; whereas with a poor formulation	the clothes exhibit a build-up of tattle-tale grey and dirty	spots- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash.	9.410677233372525
7453. since	practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number	of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation	of detergents.	8.601214925068845
7454. harris has indicated that two devices the launder-ometer	and terg-o-tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent	testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled	fabrics.	9.635941364435878
7455. also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general	use.	11.148661269589907
7456. the soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations	are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by	even the best detergent formulation in a single wash.	12.566111174549633
7457. in this way	numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations	can be obtained by measuring the reflectance of the	cloth swatches before and after washing.	10.27570407431981
7458. soil redeposition is evaluated	by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones.	11.175553353780858
7459. as is the case with	the surface-active agent the requirements for builders to be used in	detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high.	10.605529868979302
7460. large numbers	of potential builders have been investigated but none have been	found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide	range of conditions met in practice.	8.917599095874623
7461. the problems of hard-surface	cleaning are not nearly as complex.	16.259636474982464
7462. in hard-surface cleaning the	inorganic salts are more important than the organic active.	15.06948834586479
7463. indeed	when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any	wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present	in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation.	8.002060821154368
7464. hydroxides	orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important	inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners.	10.957705180640192
7465. in addition the	polyphosphates are also used probably acting more as peptizing agents	than anything else.	12.611571129779488
7466. the importance of the inorganic constituents in	hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers.	14.859532411162435
7467. chemistry of washing	although there is no question	but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena	which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that	these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the	present this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture	of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces.	7.404339574899309
7468. the purpose of washing is obviously to remove soils which are arbitrarily	classed in the four major categories given below:	dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually	inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit	colloidal properties.	9.583224589561302
7469. greasy soils which are typified by	hydrocarbons and fats.	10.530932308755343
7470. stains which include the wide variety of nonparticulate	materials which give color even when present in very low concentration	on the soiled object.	10.06418306575053
7471. miscellaneous soils which primarily	include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave	a residue.	8.62963042412541
7472. the dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically	held by surface irregularities to some extent.	11.636095537390238
7473. however a major factor	in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under	the name of van der waal's forces.	8.650471366243508
7474. this is a theoretically complicated	dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle	to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick	to an uncharged surface.	11.747058638310094
7475. obviously if colloidal particles bear charges	of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is	not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate	will be greatly reinforced.	8.04768341219779
7476. likewise a charged particle will tend	to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charged particle	will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite	charge.	8.877257962845048
7477. in addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface	by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including	liquid greases.	9.927809287838631
7478. greases stains and miscellaneous soils	are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface.	10.957705180640192
7479. in most cases these soils	are taken up as liquids through capillary action.	13.718019134696515
7480. in an essentially	static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless	the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active	agent.	11.315919095932841
7481. the washing process whereby soils are removed consists	basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles	and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off	the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating	agent.	7.9548766281895205
7482. greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water;	and	natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium	salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove.	8.801760919635912
7483. the detergent active is that substance	which primarily acts to remove greasy soils.	10.61385277229228
7484. the other constituents	in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains	and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils.	12.293451215129286
7485. as is well known	detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately	high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the	property of forming micelles in solution.	8.759286319902372
7486. physicochemical investigations	of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there	is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below	a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration.	8.67961849226925
7487. below the critical micelle concentration monomers and some	dimers are present.	11.384626257889217
7488. in the critical micelle region there is	a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles which have	a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80.	12.0129040801555
7489. for anionics	these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which	the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups	face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase.	9.282293058334462
7490. obviously	hydrophobic	substances such as greases oils or particles having	a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle	than in the aqueous phase.	12.99056785477373
7491. micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable	amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be	increased as much as approximately two-fold.	8.868940334070393
7492. although the matter has	not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles	in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process.	10.459184728109657
7493. related to micelle formation is the technologically important	ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces	in such a manner that the polar end of the molecule is directed	towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the	oily phase.	7.657284361601814
7494. in the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated	in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant.	12.88628409926433
7495. then during washing	the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets	can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of	mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase.	8.766228733348418
7496. obviously a substance	which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of	the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off	the greasy soil.	9.190725948301429
7497. substances other than detergent actives also	tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other	contiguous condensed phases.	7.9139724503302755
7498. this is particularly true of highly charged	ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes.	18.093766510194094
7499. whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly	sorbed at oil-water interfaces the highly charged ions are most strongly	sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting	an ionic structure.	7.69669906756698
7500. thus for aqueous	media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic	or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealized builder as	a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.	10.76134079109159
7501. from the equilibrium	sorption data which are available it seems logical to expect	that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of	the dirt so as to give it a greatly increased	negative charge.	10.85845971070765
7502. the charged particles then repel each other and are	also repelled from the charged surface which almost invariably bears	a negative charge under washing conditions.	10.28790619381961
7503. the negatively charged dirt	particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase.	10.157971055885024
7504. this	hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic	actives in detergency.	10.94268621302811
7505. it does not consider the kinetic effects	of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will	be discussed later.	13.006423405750578
7506. the crude picture of	the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as: f	the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may	be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale.	9.61775181549428
7507. freed soil	must be dispersed and protected against flocculation.	10.530932308755343
7508. cleaned cloth	must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil.	11.33819267263277
7509. it is	evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one	detergent constituent acting alone are severe.	10.511513581761168
7510. upon consideration	of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing	process it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent	constituents having synergistic properties has gained widespread	acceptance.	11.246203135657286
7511. in the over-all process it is difficult to assign a	pure role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation;	and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles	of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there	is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making	up a given commercial organic active.	8.573689240405079
7512. the thermal exchange of chlorine between f and liquid f is	readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180` and above.	11.257371233191828
7513. the	photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of	unity in the liquid phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the f.	9.226348002797831
7514. in the gas phase with f of f and f of f quantum yields	of the	order of f have been observed at 85`.	11.898021903107828
7515. despite extensive attempts	to obtain highly pure reagents serious difficulty was experienced in	obtaining reproducible rates of reaction.	9.170114922632786
7516. it appears possible to set	a lower limit of about f for the activation energy of the abstraction	of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine	atom to form f radical.	9.830894265792951
7517. the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction	appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light	intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at	the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular	radical combination reactions.	8.749689595510578
7518. because of the simplicity	of the molecules isotopic exchange reactions between elemental	halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer	particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic	kinetic data.	11.943151313391144
7519. it would appear that it should be possible to determine	unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both	the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies	of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals	as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen	bond.	9.152731898730075
7520. the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed	particularly suited for such studies.	14.398846034872733
7521. it should be possible to prepare	very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum	system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid.	11.625013049622803
7522. it should be	possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by	the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to	addition of radioactive chlorine.	12.311052817791758
7523. furthermore the exchange would not	be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it	would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for	abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be	too high; also it would be expected that f would compete very effectively	with any impurities as a scavenger for f radicals.	7.641103479500217
7524. contrary	to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree	of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare	especially pure reagents.	8.979646662218858
7525. we are reporting these investigations	here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently	simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results	furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of	chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride.	8.910437715208882
7526. matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a	tube of resublimed f into an evacuated pyrex system where it was condensed	with liquid air.	9.191353124727307
7527. it was then distilled at least three times	from a trap at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction	being retained in each distillation.	9.741461107858996
7528. the purified product was	stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break seal.	12.76064779398364
7529. of several	methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange	of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature	was found to be the most satisfactory.	9.498189857875069
7530. to prepare the latter	silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing f obtained	from the oak ridge national laboratory.	11.367085707854784
7531. the silver chloride was	fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant	product of f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line.	8.788781651253771
7532. previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange	was allowed to take place.	10.939563857684846
7533. the radiochlorine was stored at -78`	in a tube equipped with a break seal.	11.293659732530976
7534. liter quantities of mallinckrodt	low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated	with f and f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt	tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches.	9.195576178786364
7535. the mixture was then extracted	with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride	was distilled on a vigreux column a 25% center cut being retained	which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of f.	8.274092162766381
7536. purified	inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described	above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with	a break seal.	11.113862934260096
7537. this chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated	for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum	system and the excess chlorine distilled off.	8.393287213964337
7538. the required amount of	carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on	a manifold on a vacuum line.	11.21085363349137
7539. the desired amounts of inactive chlorine	and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on	the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold	as a whole was sealed off.	8.153804970151215
7540. the contents of the manifold for liquid phase	experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction	tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off.	9.5205401460022
7541. the reactants	for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm	attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold	of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off.	7.834386371692603
7542. this method	in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations	reaction conditions	- the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction	studies were prepared in pyrex capillary tubing 2.	10.07314636824454
7543. 5 mm id and	about 15 cm long.	15.87489909169074
7544. in a few experiments the tubes were made from	standard 6 mm id pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness.	13.060814882161921
7545. both	types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres	exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`.	9.293512427319497
7546. the photochemical reaction	cells consisted of 10 mm id pyrex tubing 5.	12.957840546200554
7547. 5 cm	long diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed	through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces.	11.757834924568776
7548. these cells were used rather than square pyrex tubing because	of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon	tetrachloride.	11.31937716336351
7549. the round cells were reproducibly positioned in the	light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window.	9.342569745452384
7550. two types of light source were used a thousand watt projection	lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc.	10.151813520155626
7551. the light was filtered	by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that	only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride	could enter the reaction cell.	8.198776256310808
7552. relative incident light intensities	were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system.	12.193457689852373
7553. changes of intensity	on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying	the distance of the light source from the cell.	9.101332456526885
7554. following reaction	the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous	sodium iodide solution.	10.748698481168157
7555. carrier f was added and the aqueous and	organic phases were separated	.	9.345058977386529
7556. after	titration of the liberated f with f aliquots of the aqueous and	of the organic	phase were counted in a solution-type geiger tube.	9.051154372622117
7557. in the liquid	phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was	determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments	after emptying.	9.916642691257344
7558. the fraction of exchange was determined as the	ratio of the countsminute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the	countsminute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for	equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon	tetrachloride empirically determined correction being made for the	difference in counting efficiency of f in f and f.	8.62201841102976
7559. in studying the liquid phase thermal	reaction some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared	and analyzed.	10.202796960999127
7560. experiments were done at 180 200 210 220`.	12.3482207866056
7561. following	observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly	identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and	exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per	cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether	the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine	to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface	to volume ratio in the reaction tubes.	9.144177720779327
7562. in addition to the method	described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared	by the electrolysis of a f eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange	of f with molten f.	11.78227235335409
7563. calcium hydride was substituted for f	as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride.	9.156393179952055
7564. no correlation between	these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found.	12.26051854500987
7565. the reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from f of the chlorine	exchanged per hour to 0.	9.839001967566796
7566. in most cases the	chlorine	concentration was about f.	23.798079105360348
7567. sets of reaction tubes containing 0.	11.867291106449708
7568. 2 of	an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another	both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.	11.838734232621587
7569. 4 of the chlorine	exchanged per hour.	14.02979963027766
7570. no detectable reaction was found at room temperature	the liquid	- the liquid phase photochemical	exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible	than the thermal exchange although still erratic.	9.214653385773627
7571. the improvement	was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells	prepared as a group on the same manifold.	11.587150348670166
7572. rather large differences were	still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings.	12.560363306429132
7573. some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in	the temperature range from 40 to 85` in a further endeavor to determine	the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on	the activation energy and the effect of light intensity.	8.041349960725526
7574. in all cases	there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of	illumination.	15.738871780223164
7575. by comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold	temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging	from 11 to 18 f was observed while dependence on the first power of	the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases.	8.78399957285806
7576. it	was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent	of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated	for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions	based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl	oxalate and of chlorine and considering the spectral distribution of	the light source.	8.51501742145494
7577. these estimates indicated that the quantum yield	for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65`	is of the order of magnitude of unity.	10.487168748944082
7578. when typical reaction	cells to which 0.	19.74916432353296
7579. 3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated	chlorine and phosgene were produced.	10.668819146338782
7580. exchange was also observed	the photochemical	- although there was some variation	in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or	to variation in wall effects the photochemical exchange in the gas phase	was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare	the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose	of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration	and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate.	8.534936141214091
7581. data	on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity	are given in table 1.	10.227545505240789
7582. in series 1 the relative light	intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the	reaction cell over the range from 14.	10.536087323936263
7583. the last column	shows the rate of exchange that would have been oserved at a relative	intensity of 4 calculated on the assumptions that	the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square	of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly	proportional to the incident light intensity.	8.12396816300354
7584. direct proportionality	of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining	the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2	where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen.	9.53180024566152
7585. the poynting-robertson effect	which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles	by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging	solar radiation causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much	shorter than the age of the earth.	7.619548827671368
7586. the radial velocity varies inversely	as the particle size- a 1000-|m-diameter particle near the	orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years.	10.095713654014379
7587. whipple	extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation	pressure which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag.	8.489296170455487
7588. further the corpuscular radiation ie the solar-wind protons	must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow	diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson	effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational	force.	8.909545720156059
7589. the poynting-robertson effect causes the semi-major	axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis	with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move	toward the sun.	7.842562774759641
7590. also planetary gravitational attraction increases	the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is	approached.	11.80928840443105
7591. at one astronomical unit from the sun	the dust orbits are probably nearly circular.	13.262619217504918
7592. if such is the case	the particles within a distance of about f km of the earth	will	have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential	energy and they will be captured into orbits about the earth.	10.80460466684659
7593. de	jager has calculated the times required for these particles	to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the poynting-robertson	effect which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more	eccentric	without changing the semi-major axis.	8.440801552716241
7594. this effect can give rise to	a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth.	12.696409780395436
7595. since there is	a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the	radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise	micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space.	9.107855191980358
7596. there	are several possible sources.	18.969942067020153
7597. according to whipple cometary	debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the	sun maintaining a fairly steady state.	10.526441708826486
7598. asteroidal collisions are also	thought to contribute material.	13.037321475654965
7599. it is also possible that some of	the dust in the vicinity of the earth originated from meteoritic impacts	upon the moon.	17.397991170956
7600. one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite	flux in space.	14.138958740472301
7601. even in the neighborhood of the earth where information	has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux	values vary by at least four orders of magnitude.	12.511225063413253
7602. this large discrepancy	demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the	lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved.	12.380444581336214
7603. beyond a	few million kilometers from the earth but still in the region of the	earth's orbit a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable.	9.133778889202572
7604. at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less	certain.	16.45768016552597
7605. there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite	environment.	18.8521949047822
7606. direct information has been obtained from rockets	and satellites equipped with impact sensors.	10.635267499930531
7607. in addition the size	distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may	be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain.	11.844575242639491
7608. from the brightness of	the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal	light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial	distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic	plane.	10.250058571776036
7609. another important source of evidence only recently receiving	much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic	component.	8.43828865832834
7610. the cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors	in remote regions are valuable in this category.	11.026675696446196
7611. the data provide a	measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth.	10.374937985916516
7612. the direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the	earth is	obtained from piezoelectric sensors	and from wire gages; these instruments are installed on rockets satellites	and space probes.	9.488339800308188
7613. statistically the most significant data have	been collected from the sensors on 1958 alpha	1958 delta 2.	8.555377644495325
7614. these	vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough	times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure.	9.051154372622117
7615. many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products	contribute some information.	11.93359137447661
7616. the impact rate on 1958 alpha	for 153 events was f for particles of mass greater than f	; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration	and an assumed impact velocity of f.	9.3455990821362
7617. the data show daily and diurnal	variations.	15.260583014183545
7618. ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred	between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate	was as much as an order of magnitude.	11.721528631222956
7619. one may conclude that most	of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams	which intersect the earth's orbit.	9.697817997121184
7620. there have been contradictory	reports from 1958 delta 2 and the data quoted here are believed	to be the more reliable.	15.599016037989214
7621. on may 15 a very large increase occurred	with f of mass between f and f; for the next two days	the impact rate was f; and for the next nine days the impact rate	was less than f.	9.899124088627955
7622. the data for the first day indicate	a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may	have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux.	14.084104365356053
7623. preliminary	data from 1959 eta give an average impact rate of f for masses	larger than f for about 1000 events in a 22-day period	.	7.556878632736834
7624. the day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor	of 4.	15.208693456981273
7625. the data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations.	11.572314230763848
7626. note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 alpha and	that the flux is one fifth as large.	10.537423870286824
7627. if one assumes that the average	flux did not change between measurements a mass-distribution curve is	obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius	to the inverse 72 power of the radius.	8.898996600707044
7628. space probes have	yielded little information.	15.735288950689954
7629. pioneer 1 recorded a decrease in flux	with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours.	9.765313024377575
7630. with	detectors	sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts	the second and third russian space probes indicate that the flux	of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones.	9.748715660353241
7631. being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity.	9.786836046724925
7632. the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle	parameters is very uncertain.	15.38689237768782
7633. many workers believe that the response	is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation	deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic	velocities.	8.832395447430896
7634. however one must expect that vaporization and ejection	of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear	relationship.	10.7316486677115
7635. in the united states most of the sensors are calibrated	by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces.	16.077961038593674
7636. the	russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse	from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder	being momentum of ejected material from the sensor.	10.185528811930448
7637. this ejection	momentum is linearly related to the particle energy.	14.522221352171046
7638. they quote	about the same mass threshold as that of the us apparatus but	a momentum threshold about 40 times greater.	14.120087845428735
7639. there is a difference	in the experimental arrangement in that the us microphones are	attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments	are isolated from the skin.	13.03903766420415
7640. the threshold mass is derived from the	momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of f	in the us work and f in the	ussr work.	9.383320969345357
7641. the threshold	mass of about f corresponds to a 10-|m-diameter sphere of	density f.	10.61385277229228
7642. however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable	since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound	meteorite structure with densities as low as f.	11.178129340298947
7643. to what extent	such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown.	12.612810545255888
7644. the velocity	value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction	of the dust is orbiting about the earth only about one third the above-mentioned	average velocity should be used in deriving the mass.	0.0
7645. zodiacal	light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust	blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture	is in circular orbits about the sun as indicated by the trend of the	smaller visible meteors.	8.114641972117399
7646. the diurnal variation in the observed flux	may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the	incident velocity.	11.028588892868669
7647. the flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood	of the earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and	visual meteor data.	9.025768581614551
7648. a summary of meteorite data prepared by whipple	on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence	is given in table 5-1.	10.922772903777382
7649. from an estimated mass of 25 g for a	zero-magnitude meteorite the other masses are derived with the assumption	of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.	8.449815832267134
7650. 512 for each unit increase in	magnitude.	13.915190642667962
7651. the radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres	of density f except for the smallest particles which must have a	higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of	solar-radiation pressure.	9.208374757430414
7652. the flux values are for all particles with	masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the	numbers of visual meteors.	10.521269240431813
7653. it is assumed that the flux values increase	by a factor of 2.	18.022828241229305
7654. 512 per magnitude in accordance with the opinion	that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant.	10.234601587964507
7655. the values agree with the data from 1958 alpha and 1959 eta.	11.110131585198689
7656. the figures	in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50	per cent shielding by the earth; hence these figures apply immediately	above the earth's atmosphere.	9.488339800308188
7657. the unshielded flux is given	in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the	flux in interplanetary space near the earth.	8.409778452916047
7658. of course if there	is a dust blanket around the earth the fluxes in interplanetary space	should be less than the figures given here.	13.242520286389306
7659. note that the mass	scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously	used; for example jacchia derived a scale of 0.	8.878766917997735
7660. 15 g for	a f zero-magnitude meteorite.	14.439924787463871
7661. the older scales were based on theoretical	estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into	light.	9.97313087631216
7662. the mass scale used in table 5-1 was derived on the assumption	that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum	transfer to the trail by the meteorite permitting the calculation of	the mass if the velocity is known.	9.12015798582493
7663. a concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations	sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude.	9.966061740790925
7664. extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers	the range of micrometeorites.	10.635267499930531
7665. the approximate equation is f	where n	is the number of f with electron line-density greater than	or equal to f and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite.	8.344888215513386
7666. therefore n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed	and in fair agreement with the inverse 72 power derived from 1958 alpha	and 1959 eta data.	9.111216528013157
7667. at the fifteenth magnitude f and at the twenty-fifth	magnitude f.	17.684722299428916
7668. these extrapolated fluxes are about an order	of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the	figures in whipple's table.	10.413748162343712
7669. the extrapolation may be in error for	several reasons.	15.70353153522731
7670. the observational data determining the concentration	distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension	into the micrometeorite region.	10.552736946158015
7671. the solar-electromagnetic- and	corpuscular-radiation	pressure and the associated poynting-robertson effect	increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify	the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns.	8.138215495683314
7672. also	it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may	not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites	and the same distribution would not be expected.	11.863369686035151
7673. of micrometeorite flux	a measure of the total mass accretion	of meteoritic material by the earth is obtained from analyses of	deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions	.	8.6965454070931
7674. most meteoritic material by the time it reaches the earth's	surface has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material	in its passage through the atmosphere.	11.357879883540681
7675. for all meteorites the average	nickel content is about 2.	14.969097324807317
7676. this is much higher than the	nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis	for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx.	12.396211040527273
7677. present data	indicate an accretion of about f tons per year over the entire globe	or about f.	8.629891865543991
7678. biological warfare is the intentional use of	living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying	or reducing the military effectiveness of man.	9.878197341912797
7679. it is the exploitation	of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific	research and development resulting in the production of bw	weapons systems.	12.804536574791952
7680. man may also be injured secondarily by damage to	his food crops or domestic animals.	13.25433223931114
7681. biological warfare is considered	to be primarily a strategic weapon.	10.057988591011652
7682. the major reason for this	is that it has no quick-kill effect.	17.285116122372166
7683. the incubation period of infectious	disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect	render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter.	8.409778452916047
7684. a man	can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period	of most infectious diseases.	11.339107725659472
7685. thus an enemy would probably use this weapon	for attack on static population centers such as large cities.	9.399299589835328
7686. an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would	be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area.	9.519639727796076
7687. this	concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of	particulate biological materials the pathogenesis of respiratory infections	the medical management of such diseases and defense against their	occurrence.	7.358893154931528
7688. the biological and physical properties of infectious	particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen	years.	12.605919892000712
7689. much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed	for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols	of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional	characteristics.	7.977690681124178
7690. much information has been gathered relative to quantitative	sampling and assesment techniques.	12.878017281082306
7691. much of the older experimental	work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial	procedures.	15.796891661003519
7692. the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious	agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure	through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms.	9.725942325839862
7693. the	importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated.	9.528667773037851
7694. the natural anatomical and physiological defensive features	of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and	the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging	out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily	existence.	9.617278231652884
7695. very small particles however in a size range of 1 to	4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers	and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs.	7.816023603538525
7696. this area is highly susceptible	to infection.	18.474861091230572
7697. the entrance and retention of infectious particles	in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation.	11.5768921603531
7698. the	relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated	in table 1.	10.957705180640192
7699. in considering bw defense it must be recognized	that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for	an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect.	9.99023649078237
7700. for example bright sunlight	is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air.	15.485394254321793
7701. there	are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne.	10.900188788523568
7702. neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a	cloud to travel along the surface.	10.63218492720835
7703. it will rise during lapse conditions.	26.45803100104439
7704. there are of course certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle	when most of these conditions will be met.	15.805057507923273
7705. certain other properties	of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in	connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy	in defense considerations.	9.086003269368616
7706. the smaller the particle the further it will	travel downwind before settling out.	12.445450562798397
7707. an aerosol of such small particles.	13.924735272543572
7708. moreover diffuses through structures in much the same manner as	a gas.	20.738805175618904
7709. there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion	through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens	restaurants food stores hospitals etc.	12.258648180472937
7710. depending on the organism	there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products ie	in milk for example.	10.547945318673932
7711. the secondary consequences from this could	be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for	defense.	14.338101317261026
7712. something of the behavior of clouds of small particles	can be illustrated by the following field trials:   in the	first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling	some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological	conditions.	9.453893945641962
7713. zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were	disseminated.	9.345058977386529
7714. this material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which	facilitates its sampling and assessment.	13.236737574390107
7715. four hundred and fifty pounds	was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156	miles.	10.65637107945682
7716. figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial.	11.793662721363662
7717. the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles.	11.050834287616778
7718. from these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000	square miles was covered.	14.434639754256331
7719. these dosages could have been increased	by increasing the source strength which was small in this case.	9.720789525590934
7720. the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated	by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism.	10.330612848793074
7721. an aqueous suspension of the spores of b subtilis var	niger generally known as bacillus globigii was aerosolized	using commercially available nozzles.	8.706102967351535
7722. a satisfactory cloud was produced	even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in	producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns.	10.972548037353597
7723. in this	test 130 gallons of a suspension having a count of f organisms	per ml or a total of approximately f spores was aerosolized.	9.322660983633986
7724. the	spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval	vessel cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze.	9.376668190559428
7725. spraying continued along a two-mile course.	11.867291106449708
7726. this operation	was started at 5:00 pm and lasted for 29 minutes.	13.236737574390107
7727. there was	a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative	humidity.	13.593870648562953
7728. a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore.	15.395477400205008
7729. these	were located at the homes of government employees in government	offices buildings and reservations within the trial area.	8.1523940120599
7730. a rough	attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by	taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth	floors of a government office building.	11.118226796951603
7731. all samplers were	operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated	for four hours.	11.776955636074408
7732. in this instance there was a dosage of 562 during the	first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period	a four-fold increase.	11.806182882212001
7733. this suggests that the sampling period particularly	at the more distant locations should have been increased.	10.591869705701038
7734. as can be seen from figure 2 an extensive area was covered by this	aerosol.	15.964626374702071
7735. the maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source.	11.572314230763848
7736. as can be seen from these dosage isopleths approximately 100 square	miles was covered within the area sampled.	13.616846817336778
7737. it is quite likely that	an even greater area was covered particularly downwind.	17.507815094431344
7738. the dosages	in the three levels of the vertical profile were: f   this was	not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description	of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol.	9.921756739191414
7739. a number of unique medical	problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious	agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal	of entry.	10.31653320765105
7740. some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious	to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle	size than by the natural portal.	9.956533265375025
7741. botulinal toxin for example is several	thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os.	8.29272515769823
7742. in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from	this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult.	13.404419283147236
7743. in tularemia produced	by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical	ulcer of rabbit fever on a finger.	11.028226782847888
7744. an enemy would obviously	choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious.	15.008294463525765
7745. agents	that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers	such as those causing q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders	coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category.	7.8554728956294655
7746. an agent	would	likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence	stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements.	10.315426272035957
7747. it	is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property.	10.050130201827185
7748. in this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without	excessive destruction.	22.656214084886525
7749. moreover it should not be so fastidious in	its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant	scale improbable.	10.419475369222518
7750. an aggressor would use an agent against	which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced	immunity in a target population.	10.495558630917538
7751. a solid immunity is the one effective	circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized.	10.523112268714994
7752. it must be remembered however that there are many agents for which	there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be	broken by an appropriate dose of agent.	12.355503056825265
7753. there is a broad spectrum	of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose	might be made.	14.874637500988793
7754. an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism	a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality.	10.364937814119978
7755. it is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced	such as antibiotic resistant strains.	18.34742613882179
7756. mutants may also be developed	with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in	identification.	11.226523635125076
7757. all of these considerations are of critical importance	in considering defense and medical management.	13.512077245205779
7758. biological agents	are of course highly host-specific.	13.915190642667962
7759. they do not destroy physical	structures as is true of high explosives.	18.01451992530244
7760. this may be of overriding	importance in considering military objectives.	25.225175657833617
7761. the question	of epidemic disease merits some discussion.	13.974661317959146
7762. only a limited effort has	been devoted to this problem.	16.541722145750583
7763. some of those who question the value	of bw have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment	of epidemics.	14.324119255288176
7764. they then point out that with our present lack	of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall	of epidemics it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated.	10.303506456107511
7765. they argue further that our knowledge	and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control	such an outbreak of disease.	9.291205925491846
7766. this is why this approach to bw	defense has not been given major attention.	18.08716967382576
7767. our major problem	is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target.	9.78291066135918
7768. this	of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose	agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease.	9.559225930701576
7769. a hypothetical	example will illustrate this point.	14.566660921827188
7770. let us assume that it would	be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent	of epidemic typhus over city a and	that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom.	11.294562035884969
7771. no epidemic	was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city	a was not lousy.	9.5257324697952
7772. lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus.	13.037321475654965
7773. in this case then the military objective was accomplished with	an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial	attack.	10.958776729892339
7774. this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic.	21.30702490312707
7775. on the other hand a similar attack might have been made on city	b whose population was known to be lousy.	16.541850880272378
7776. one might expect some	spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness	of the attack.	14.157298824281892
7777. the major defensive problems are concerned	with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from	appropriate disseminating devices.	10.329414882029608
7778. it should be no more difficult	to deliver such devices than other weapons.	23.084780744738566
7779. the same delivery vehicles-	whether they be airplanes submarines or guided missiles- should	be usable.	11.382045727296116
7780. if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on	a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent	over that city.	14.183885418709913
7781. biological agents are moreover suitable	for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense.	8.450640073948662
7782. a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned.	14.741680090071405
7783. the air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are	subject to attack.	11.889408092888727
7784. america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses	processed precooked and even predigested foods.	12.11855572438216
7785. this is an enormous	industry that is subject to sabotage.	20.436910423801155
7786. one must include the preparation	of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products.	12.803869227519057
7787. huge	industries are involved also in the production of biological products	drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack.	9.867242652498833
7788. a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation	and study of blood group antibodies.	12.169727202411908
7789. these include low-temperature	ethanol fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and	column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses.	11.682949598435764
7790. modifications of	the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators.	10.635267499930531
7791. abelson and rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated	whole sera containing abo and rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl	deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose.	7.719095379114949
7792. speer	and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole	sera used a series of gradients for elution from deae-cellulose.	10.144361964210074
7793. fahey and morrison used a single continuous gradient at constant	ph for the fractionation of anti-a and anti-b agglutinins	from preisolated |g-globulin samples.	7.719095379114949
7794. in the	present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on	deae-cellulose	using single gradients similar to those described	by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological properties	of the fractions containing antibodies of the abo and rh	systems have been described.	8.835383382553985
7795. serum samples were obtained from normal group a group b	and group o donors.	8.834168570742513
7796. three of the anti-rh sera used were taken	from recently sensitized individuals.	14.895993363220112
7797. one contained complete antibody	and had a titer of 1:512 in saline.	11.65298483791174
7798. the second contained incomplete	antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by	the indirect coombs test.	11.578416938866729
7799. the third containing the mixed type of complete	and incomplete antibodies had titers of 1:256 in saline 1:512	in albumin and 1:1024 by the indirect coombs test.	8.487927448492893
7800. in addition	one serum was obtained from a donor who had been sensitized	6 years previously.	13.566369494314458
7801. this serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin	and 1:256 by the indirect coombs test.	10.101285660705964
7802. these antibody titers	serological	anti-a and anti-b activities were determined	in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o	donors by the following tube agglutination methods.	9.13827729073226
7803. one drop of each	sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group f or	group b red cells in a small f test tube.	8.875175775920653
7804. in several instances	group o cells were also used as controls.	17.292312378278723
7805. the red cells were used	within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline	before use.	9.367160585846518
7806. the mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed	to stand at room temperature for 1 hr.	11.81809839144493
7807. the tubes were then	centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for	agglutination.	10.10542895720565
7808. for the albumin method equal volumes of 30% bovine	albumin sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to	stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000	rpm for 1 min.	9.770918679928545
7809. all samples were tested by both the saline and	albumin methods.	11.558000542550099
7810. the activities of fractions of sera containing rh	antibodies were tested by the saline albumin and indirect coombs	techniques.	11.23769389194712
7811. homozygous and heterozygous f cells f and homozygous	and heterozygous f cells were used to test each sample; however	in the	interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with	homozygous f and homozygous f cells will be presented here.	7.187902839610151
7812. the saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the abo	samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37`c	before centrifugation.	10.209732062935885
7813. the saline tubes were saved and used	for	the indirect coombs test in the following manner.	11.282657674173056
7814. the cells were washed	three times with saline anti-human serum was added the cells were	resuspended and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min	and examined for agglutination.	9.4317506244252
7815. the anti-human sera used were prepared	by injecting whole human serum into rabbits.	10.61385277229228
7816. those antisera shown	by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type were	selected for used in the present study.	14.611395736223441
7817. the red cells for the	rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except	for the f cells which had been glycerolized and stored at -20`c	for approximately 1 year.	8.111823447878326
7818. these cells were thawed at 37`c for 30	min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing	with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions	.	9.696189528033115
7819. the cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended	to 2% in saline.	9.923610580026844
7820. blood samples were	allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuged and the	serum	was removed.	10.856086341601213
7821. the serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently	dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes	approximately 750 ml each of starting buffer.	9.70373704535279
7822. 6 was 0.	20.470558830993955
7823. 005 m in f and 0.	11.867291106449708
7824. 039 m in	tris-aminomethane	.	18.919390992859817
7825. after dialysis the sample was centrifuged	and the supernatant placed on a f cm column of eeae-cellulose	equilibrated with starting buffer.	9.301133292014152
7826. 78 meq of ng was prepared in our laboratory	by the method of peterson and sober from powdered cellulose 100-230	mesh.	10.385249077038035
7827. the small amount of insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer	centrifuged resuspended in 2.	8.71104106059315
7828. 5 ml of isotonic saline and tested	for antibody activity.	15.940979230200977
7829. the chromatography was done at 6`c	using gradient elution essentially according to sober and peterson.	9.923610580026844
7830. the deep concave gradient employed was obtained with	a nine-chambered gradient elution device	and has been described elsewhere.	11.409754061963985
7831. the other a shallow concave	gradient was produced with a so-called cone-sphere	apparatus the cone being a 2-liter erlenmeyer flask	and the sphere a 2-liter round-bottom flask.	8.107205345898912
7832. each initially contained	1700 ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and	in the cone was final buffer 0.	9.994688367003084
7833. 50 m in both f and tris ph	4.	12.56147126011629
7834. a flow rate of 72 f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected.	12.018427013475849
7835. approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column.	10.530932308755343
7836. these were read at 280 m|m in a beckman model du spectrophotometer	paper	electrophoresis.	12.317014505865435
7837. fractions from the	column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5`c	or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted	simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic	saline.	7.111943144360655
7838. during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained	at 2`c by surrounding the apparatus with ice.	13.912635800246496
7839. because negative	pressure	dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection	of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler	procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments.	9.716225939310448
7840. paper	electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a spinco	model r cell using barbital buffer ph 8.	10.339192617247583
7841. 075 at room temperature on whatman 3mm filter paper.	11.189828893719817
7842. five	milliamperescell were applied for 18 hr after which the strips	were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using	a spinco analytrol.	8.951887347307554
7843. when paper electrophoresis was to be	used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic	fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were runchamber	under the conditions described above.	8.169161821673285
7844. at the end of the run	the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried	stained for 1 hr washed and dried while the other strips were	maintained in a horizontal position at 1`c.	12.01494507152131
7845. the unstained strips	were	then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely	so as to separate the various protein bands.	8.680665962472078
7846. the strip sections containing	a given protein were pooled eluted with 0.	12.957840546200554
7847. 5 ml of isotonic	saline and the eluates were tested for antibody activity.	11.586165172313304
7848. fractions from the column which were to be subjected	to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500	volumes of phosphate-buffered saline ph 7.	9.31474302481151
7849. they were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min	at 20`c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration	of 1.	8.779981884884032
7850. sedimentation coefficients were computed	as f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated	from the schlieren patterns.	9.872676576334475
7851. for preparative ultracentrifugation	fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less transferred to cellulose	tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline.	7.904482161713711
7852. ultracentrifugation	was then carried out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at	40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min refrigeration being used throughout	the run.	9.64012345421199
7853. successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a	hypodermic syringe starting at the top of the tube and tested for agglutinin	activity.	11.678273778841445
7854. other methods will be described below.	15.725705363633404
7855. the insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin	activity regardless of the blood group of the donor.	9.962656751443156
7856. with either	of the gradients described chromatography on deae-cellulose	separated agglutinins of the abo series into at least three regions	: one of extremely low anionic binding capacity	one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding	capacity.	9.888366350338126
7857. these have been labeled regions 1 2 and 4 respectively	in fig 1.	10.420642243356971
7858. when the early part of the gradient was flattened	either by using the gradient shown in fig 2 or by allowing the cone-sphere	gradient to become established more slowly region 2 activity	could sometimes be separated into two areas	.	12.271586389140486
7859. the latter	procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak between	regions 1 and 2.	12.349704046457687
7860. in 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of	agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected	.	10.97580523298895
7861. moreover after concentration using negative	pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected	in the region designated 2a	.	9.367614614804978
7862. not all these regions exhibited equal	agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the	active areas.	13.763951338406928
7863. in all cases most of the activity lay in the region of	high anionic binding capacity.	15.343402655044008
7864. this was particularly noticeable in group	a and group b sera in which cases activity in regions 1	and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally	could not be detected at all.	9.556589666771359
7865. there appeared to be no difference	in the distribution of anti-a and anti-b activity in group	o serum though in two group o donors	only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic	binding capacity.	10.233187436152765
7866. several samples of	citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by method 6 of cohn	et al.	10.658425710564716
7867. these fractions were tested for abo agglutinin	activity using fractions from group ab plasma as a control.	9.037923827668624
7868. as expected most of the activity was found in fraction f with	slight activity seen in fraction 4-1.	13.1912848104154
7869. a sample of fraction f	from group o plasma was dissolved in starting buffer dialyzed against	this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown	in fig 2.	8.36886144432519
7870. once again both anti-a and anti-b activities	were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis.	13.949433576505239
7871. similarly both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the	chromatographic eluate having extremely low low and high anionic	binding capacity respectively.	8.105337966302569
7872. chromatography of	whole sera revealed that the areas of rh antibody activity were generally	continuous and wide.	10.407659722371127
7873. the incomplete antibody activity appeared	in the early part of the chromatogram; the complete in the latter	part.	12.818373166344816
7874. the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete	antibodies showed activity in both regions.	11.311263844877574
7875. in all cases	the activity against f cells was spread over a wider area than that	with f cells regardless of the type of test	used for comparison.	11.173344653863879
7876. the insoluble material resulting	from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity.	12.445450562798397
7877. in	fact agglutination of f cells in saline could be produced by the	insoluble material from sera containing only incomplete antibody	activity.	7.96629078878188
7878. this was later known to be the result of concentrating the	minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera; when the insoluble	fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of	the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected.	10.41727721043954
7879. apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees	hibernate in a state of torpor.	14.190474580174778
7880. occasionally you may come across one	or two bumblebees in the cold season when you are turning over sods	in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them	at all.	11.173924409947338
7881. they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their	bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well	mistake them for lumps of dirt.	8.884397900653026
7882. i must add at once that these animals	are what we call queens young females that have mated in the previous	summer or autumn.	10.96361225419634
7883. it is on them alone that the future of their	race depends for all their relatives	have perished with the arrival of the cold weather.	14.387778554040327
7884. even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling	prey to enemies or disease.	12.751945476594434
7885. the survivors emerge on some nice sunny	day in march or april when the temperature is close to 50` f	and there is not too much wind.	10.83931799697532
7886. now the thing for us to do is to find	ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the	red ribes sanguineum of our pacific northwest or otherwise a	good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably	one with male or staminate catkins.	10.18408943168061
7887. the blooms of ribes and of	the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects	will assemble: honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and	also various kinds of flies.	8.393062588562403
7888. it is a happy buzzing crowd.	39.89123106056627
7889. each	male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers.	14.821308925565956
7890. it is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always	arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one	such pair standing on a green black-tipped little scale.	13.686187497372426
7891. by scrutinizing	the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two	tiny warts.	9.379267787495897
7892. those are the nectaries or honey glands	.	16.11857002761021
7893. the staminate willow catkins then provide their visitors with	both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement for it provides	exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination	of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.	7.660537958543056
7894. the	only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites.	11.06897560844949
7895. i	will deal with these later on.	11.867291106449708
7896. quite often honeybees form a	majority on the willow catkins.	12.827017622004428
7897. as we have already seen in the first	chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees	exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and	orange.	11.512210872174442
7898. let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and	let us just call them bombus; there must be several dozen species	in the	united states alone.	12.024189266469763
7899. if you really insist on knowing their names	an excellent book on the north american species is bumblebees and	their ways by o e plath.	10.779725954329056
7900. if we manage to keep track	of a bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may	discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself	when she woke up from her winter sleep.	9.783843956273879
7901. as befits a queen a bumblebee	female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for	a suitable nesting place.	9.232528732235574
7902. most species seem to prefer a ready-made	hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made	by a woodpecker; some show a definite liking for making their nest in	moss.	9.320679599087798
7903. once she has made up her mind the queen starts out by constructing	in her chosen abode a small floor of dried grass or some	woolly material.	8.158319700067347
7904. on this she builds an egg compartment or egg	cell which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture	called beebread.	12.03831392629446
7905. she also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills	with honey.	12.819930202168532
7906. then a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the	beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed.	11.543089521841024
7907. the queen afterward	keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip	from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots.	9.100518993237722
7908. when	the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive	extra honey meals from their mother.	9.960270133986333
7909. she continues to add to the	pollen supply as needed.	15.499492439725875
7910. the larvae kept warm by the queen	are full grown in about ten days.	12.010194183656237
7911. each now makes a tough papery cocoon	and pupates.	12.141006964183084
7912. after another two weeks the first young emerge four	to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees	collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young	generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying.	10.916522572436179
7913. the first	worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and mating females do not	emerge until later in the season.	9.497720915943663
7914. the broods of workers that appear	later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are	better fed.	12.119337550618875
7915. by the middle of the summer many of the larvae apparently	receive such a good diet that it is optimal and it is then	that young queens begin to appear.	12.920090175852236
7916. simultaneously males or drones are	produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a	few may be produced by the queen.	9.239528494510049
7917. the young queens and drones leave the	nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilized	young	queens will begin to dig in for the winter.	8.840766393113183
7918. it is an amazing fact that	in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full	swing for instance in august.	14.73048796887976
7919. the temperature then is still very	high.	16.15319076460511
7920. at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay	the fertilized eggs that will produce females.	12.83699352915984
7921. as a result the proportion	of males increases and eventually the old	colony will die out completely.	14.163441042575835
7922. the nest itself the structure that	in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its	peak is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain	beetles and moths.	9.279183334061178
7923. not always though does the development of	a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described.	11.76962088072691
7924. some members of the bee family have become idlers social parasites	that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives.	15.359459221121792
7925. bumblebees	can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of psithyrus the	cuckoo-bumblebee as it is called in some european countries.	9.146705695508242
7926. female individuals of psithyrus look deceptively like the workers	and queens of the bumblebees they victimize.	9.908939338115298
7927. the one sure way to tell	victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the	case of the idler psithyrus lack the pollen baskets- naturally!	the female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest	of her host.	8.539089432876999
7928. when she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively	to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the	bumblebees seal the egg compartment.	10.377239877710995
7929. the hosts never seem to recognize	that something is amiss so that the compartment afterward is sealed	normally.	10.327694244401066
7930. thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense	of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread.	11.785676951088865
7931. later on they	and the mother psithyrus are fed by the bombus workers.	11.909192886702892
7932. worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the psithyrus	female kills off the bombus queen.	11.376049534454378
7933. but let us return	after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring;	there are other wild bees that command our attention.	9.450727253726056
7934. it	is almost certain that some of these usually a trifle smaller than the	honeybees are andrenas or mining bees.	12.45445246066886
7935. there are about 200 different	kinds of andrena in europe alone.	18.355309196898887
7936. one of my favorites is a	armata a species very common in england where it is sometimes	referred to as the lawn bee.	14.604908143886247
7937. the females like to burrow in the short	turf of well-kept lawns where their little mounds of earth often appear	by the hundreds.	8.535996319710994
7938. almost equal in size to a honeybee.	15.540642501959478
7939. a armata	is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species:	a rich velvety rusty red.	11.404815684809401
7940. the males are much duller.	19.926638570224114
7941. after having mated an andrena female digs a hole straight down	into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil.	10.771961283601271
7942. the bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or cells	each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread.	12.87772895002187
7943. the	development of the andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the	end of spring they have already pupated and become adults.	7.97789933048673
7944. but they	are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout	the summer fall and winter.	11.827068246062383
7945. their appearance next spring coincides	in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants.	9.164617100996999
7946. in the sacramento valley in california for instance it has been observed	that there was not one day's difference between the emergence	of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins.	13.563131764945668
7947. this must be	due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and	the animal.	11.5451381833246
7948. after the male and female andrenas have mated	the cycle is repeated.	15.196421165643706
7949. although andrena is gregarious so that we	may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call	it a solitary bee.	8.468305173730915
7950. its life history is much simpler than that of the	truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life	cycle of many other species.	13.168709101888469
7951. after all social life in the group of	the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking	feature.	14.638729544406177
7952. on the basis of its life history we like to think that andrena	is more primitive than the bumblebees.	16.411019383973493
7953. the way in which it transports	its pollen is not so perfect either.	22.777478160221424
7954. it lacks pollen baskets	and possesses only a large number of long branched hairs on its legs	on which the pollen grains will collect.	14.068492561076694
7955. still andrena will	do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks	like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind.	8.693107184615842
7956. closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees.	13.359497576365479
7957. nomia	melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of	the united states west of the great plains for example in utah	and central washington.	11.765389673962064
7958. in the united states department of agriculture's	yearbook of agriculture 1952 which is devoted entirely	to insects george e bohart mentions a site in utah which	was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females.	11.974080177948375
7959. often the burrows	are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres.	9.249540383940145
7960. the life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of andrena	but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer	and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage.	10.950543737959357
7961. in most places	there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing	late in the summer.	10.533854592986541
7962. i must plead guilty to a special sympathy	for nomias.	17.68995883069911
7963. this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington	but certainly i love to visit their mound cities near yakima and	prosser in july or august when the bees are in their most active	period.	8.332785025599273
7964. the name alkali bee indicates that one has to look for	them in rather inhospitable places.	14.71351022218605
7965. sometimes although by no means	always these are indeed alkaline.	11.299183009606992
7966. the thing is that these bees love	a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should	not be stagnant either.	11.853416344108572
7967. where does	one find such conditions?	16.395301430259657
7968.  the best chance of course is offered by	gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and	where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits	which permit only sparse plant growth.	10.935624007198443
7969. many other snakes at maturity are already more	than half their final length.	10.903229058624204
7970. laurence m klauber put length at maturity	at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes and charles	c carpenter's data on michigan garter and ribbon snakes	show that the smallest gravid females are more than	half as long as the biggest adults.	8.878242117176734
7971. felix kopstein states that when	the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal	length but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception	with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity.	7.246741796690732
7972. it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow	appreciably after attaining maturity; he was working with species	of java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect.	13.13901640509693
7973. certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable	difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this	is due to captive conditions.	9.19732181283435
7974. additional records of slow growth have	been omitted.	14.101411152628298
7975. it is possible to make a few generalizations about	the six giants themselves.	25.426892672098766
7976. there seems to be a rough correlation	between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest	and ending with the largest.	16.511278741072424
7977. data on the	former are scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes	born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby	lending support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain	the greatest length.	11.368702110712746
7978. for four of the six	there is also a correlation	between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor	being the smallest and the indian python the next in size at the	former stage.	10.119162731720289
7979. let us speculate a little on the maximum size	of the anaconda.	16.470655618636307
7980. if in a certain part of the range it starts life 1	foot longer than do any of the other giants and reaches	maturity at let us guess 18 inches longer than the others a	quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of	40 feet.	11.738403722156837
7981. when it comes to rate of early growth the indian	python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the	first two years more or less.	10.22148562433179
7982. the african rock python a close second	is followed in turn by the reticulate python.	11.636095537390238
7983. there are few data	on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda are unconvincing and	there is nothing at all on the amethystine python.	12.635404742301338
7984. it seems likely that	the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have	been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally	well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to	keep.	10.577401292427284
7985. i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity	growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches	rather than feet.	12.24891860967275
7986. until better records have been kept over longer	periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions	it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.	10.098351093279467
7987. it is often	stated	that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but	this apparently is an overestimation.	12.911050914630081
7988. the best way to determine the	correct figure is by direct observation of pairs isolated	from birth a method that produced surprising results: maturing of	a male indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three;	data on the boa constrictor about match this.	10.465446717464218
7989. another approach	is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at	maturity.	10.23752223229208
7990. results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations:	about three years are required there being a possible slight	difference between males and females in the time required.	8.958922857694244
7991. only the	amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity	of data.	9.88459132164739
7992. the following information on snakes varying greatly	in size shows when considered	with the foregoing that there is probably no correlation between	the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature.	10.4804257624531
7993. oliver	in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states	could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition	to the rattlers which i shall consider separately.	8.963379168435443
7994. these three	were much alike: lined snake one year and	nine months; red-bellied snake two years; cottonmouth	two years.	10.597568724640876
7995. klauber investigated the rattlesnakes	carefully himself and also summarized what others have found.	9.070074471681158
7996. he	concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types	females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young	when they are three.	12.006157534613804
7997. other herpetologists have ascertained that in	the northern united states the prairie rattlesnake may not give first	birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may	be born every other year rather than annually.	8.541661108595024
7998. carpenter's study	showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of michigan mature	at about the age of two.	10.419071640506745
7999. oversized monsters are	never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements	are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate	dimensions.	8.18182507659557
8000. measurements of skins are of little value; every	snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching	presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.	8.943044632218623
8001. in	spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on	some of the giants.	10.232110534663809
8002. the anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment	but the reason for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions	still found in tropical south america might be responsible.	12.547918129812254
8003. there are three levels on which to treat the subject.	23.059092734444718
8004. the first is	the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may	err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh.	10.888379940903679
8005. this	approach rejects virtually all field measurements.	11.867291106449708
8006. the next level	attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion;	field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected	and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated.	10.530329506076454
8007. the third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire.	11.969198005325058
8008. the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which	rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves	into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people	out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove	to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes	or ghosts.	8.914504823634505
8009. oliver has recently used the second-level approach	with the largest snakes and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda	reaches a length of at least 37 feet the reticulate python 33	the african rock python 25 the amethystine python at least 22 the indian	python 20 and the boa constrictor 18-12.	7.03782394777876
8010. bernard heuvelmans	also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and	is chiefly concerned with the anaconda.	12.133151532067252
8011. he reasons that as anacondas	30 feet long are often found some might be 38 and occasional monstrous	freaks over 50.	9.522885957569553
8012. he rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more.	16.477994707361407
8013. his thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents	with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his	picture not to be believed.	10.378449203879947
8014. detailed information on record	lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows.	12.18545591313694
8015. of the six giants	discussions of the giants one by one will include	as far as possible data on these aspects of growth: size at which	life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached; time required	to reach maturity; rate of growth both before and after this crucial	stage; and maximum length with confirmation or amplification	of oliver's figures.	7.738992994852292
8016. definite information on the growth of senile	individuals is lacking.	13.943087155564434
8017. at birth this species varies	considerably in size.	15.612137863886977
8018. a brood of twenty-eight born at brookfield	zoo near chicago ranged in length from 22 to 33-12 inches and averaged	29 inches.	9.976524862873173
8019. lawrence e griffin gives measurements of nineteen	young anacondas presumably members of a brood from south america;	the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit	of the brookfield brood and its average.	7.513901455922771
8020. raymond l ditmars	had	two broods that averaged 27 inches.	12.505157322409175
8021. r r mole and f w	urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood	of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuaries.	7.7450939447884
8022. william beebe	reports 26 inches and 2.	15.969432818563234
8023. 4 ounces	for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana.	11.21717637641319
8024. in contrast ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two	young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches and four young were born in london	at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces.	9.560665323183285
8025. beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.	10.398790326988289
8026. a difference	between subspecies might explain the great range in size.	13.12566368285538
8027. i have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth.	15.253542563333623
8028. hans	schweizer had one that increased from 19-12 inches to 5 feet 3 inches	in five years and j j quelch records a growth of from less	than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years.	8.718634491685233
8029. it is very unlikely that	either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate.	15.105123196608007
8030. in 1948	afranio do amaral the noted brazilian herpetologist wrote a	technical paper on the giant snakes.	12.141706617637393
8031. he concluded that the anaconda's	maximum length is 12 or 13 meters which would approximate	from 39 to 42 feet.	9.394903394107072
8032. thus	his estimate lies between oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet	and the 50-foot monstrous freaks intimated by heuvelmans.	10.165936950100981
8033. the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in	eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond	oil company and reported in 1944 by emmett r dunn.	8.112509887477728
8034. however	as a field measurement it is open to question.	12.711272124042397
8035. oliver's 37-12	feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable.	9.95380622327286
8036. however many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer	a tentative maximum of about 30 feet.	11.592477973745268
8037. it is possible that especially	large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to	a small area.	19.538819210689976
8038. in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic	of subspecies.	15.508675890424705
8039. a colombian female's brood	of sixteen boa constrictors born in the staten island zoo averaged	20 inches.	10.893397201130895
8040. this birth length seems to be typical.	20.74901840677139
8041. when some thirteen	records of newly and recently born individuals are collated little	or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected.	8.879535181671486
8042. the	range is from 14 to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat	unusual birth of four by a central american female	the latter on a normal	newly born individual.	9.47934631705628
8043. however as so many of the records are	not certainly based on newborn snakes these data must be taken tentatively;	final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods	from definite localities.	11.006532284851316
8044. alphonse r hoge's measurements	of several very young specimens from brazil suggest that at birth the	female is slightly larger than the male.	9.361953784848135
8045. i have surprisingly little	information on the size and age at maturity.	15.821964919484449
8046. carl kauffeld has	written to me of sexual activity in february 1943 of young born in march	1940.	9.723773562266802
8047. one female collected on an island off the coast of nicaragua	was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent	.	8.67117762651165
8048. the female from central	america which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long.	11.825265946678792
8049. what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation	in rate; unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual	whereas many have been made for a very short period of time.	9.128029526911925
8050. the results are too varied to allow generalization.	16.566743820444294
8051. the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close	relationship throughout.	10.242653103537407
8052. the pulmonary vein however without the limiting	supportive tissue septa as in type 1 follows a more direct	path	to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship	.	9.995705776064328
8053. another marked difference is noted here.	13.246711965542852
8054. the pulmonary artery	in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole	the alveolar duct and the alveoli continues on and directly supplies	the thin pleura.	10.312205753949476
8055. the bronchial artery except for a	small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the	pleural blood supply.	8.828385447606417
8056. it does as in type 1 supply the hilar lymph	nodes the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the	bronchioles- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary	artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole.	11.62967006902824
8057. no bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses were noted in this group.	11.981852367567186
8058. lung	type 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1	and 2.	12.022492348684999
8059. it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed	secondary lobules; well defined but haphazardly arranged interlobular	septa and a thick remarkably vascular pleura.	12.061235556481398
8060. the	most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 being	composed of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional	poorly developed respiratory bronchioles.	9.172164668110682
8061. in this	instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule does	not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung	as in type 1.	10.660755887430145
8062. air-drifts from one area to another are therefore	conceivable.	12.3482207866056
8063. distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery	on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type 1	.	8.879665443869268
8064. this relationship however is not maintained centrally.	18.441123241812942
8065. here the pulmonary vein as in type 2 is noted to draw away from	the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the	hilum.	8.874364978744321
8066. the bronchial artery in its course and distribution	differs somewhat from that found in other mammals.	11.311263844877574
8067. as seen in	types 1 and 2 it supplies the hilar lymph nodes vasa vasorum	to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles.	8.384363625555597
8068. as in type 1 it provides arterial blood to the interlobular	septa and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen	.	12.20839308979402
8069. this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular	bronchial artery branches.	10.827878305075057
8070. such a dual derivation was strikingly	demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling	would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once.	10.08571829187401
8071. some	of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the	bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches	following along the pleural surface.	7.959655609188863
8072. with completion of filling net-like	anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately	derived branches.	12.606385477421934
8073. an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries	present within the substance of the lung was noted.	13.372808544354731
8074. this was accounted	for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following	the pulmonary artery.	15.65277650024597
8075. the diameter of this bronchial artery was	much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum.	11.543089943955875
8076. in distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that	of the pulmonary artery.	12.539645154163946
8077. this vessel could be followed to the parenchyma	where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar	capillary bed.	10.029359683858594
8078. also three other direct pathways	of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via the pleura;	through the interlobular septa; and along the terminal bronchiole	.	10.125146180779174
8079. one bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar	anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level.	11.65298483791174
8080. it is evident that many marked and striking differences	exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made.	15.92661979001771
8081. the	significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence	of corresponding physiologic differences been determined.	9.129030637199381
8082. however	the dynamics of airflow from morphologic considerations alone	may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse.	10.805771483212954
8083. the volume	and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood	flow might be different in the dog than in the horse.	10.627469242618764
8084. also interlobular	air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably occur	in the horse much as in the human being; and in contrast are present	to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where	lobules are absent.	9.404482019669967
8085. a reason	for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking	at present.	9.966061740790925
8086. within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function	and if one is permitted to speculate potential pathology should	be included in this statement as well.	10.883034927948376
8087. for example the marked susceptibility	of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its	delicate long alveolar ducts and short large bronchioles situated	within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue	barriers such as those found in types 1 and 3.	8.544928671812851
8088. one might also	wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know	it in man or the horse.	12.917604076545079
8089. in addition it would be difficult to imagine	chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow considering its marked	lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this	occurring in the horse or the dog.	10.475724676486367
8090. anatomically the horse lung	appears to be remarkably like that of man insofar as this can be ascertained	from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of	others in the human being.	10.082649166739161
8091. the only area in which	one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar	distribution of the bronchial arteries.	13.554388774730317
8092. as early as 1858 le	fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human	beings.	15.192277454848806
8093. in 1951 this was reaffirmed by cudkowicz.	16.37525627429589
8094. the opposition	to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of miller	.	18.014653387906115
8095. apparently however miller has relied heavily on the	anatomy in dogs and cats and he has been criticized for using pathologic	human material in his normal study.	8.775408903199805
8096. although miller	noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed	between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he	did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian	lungs other than in the dog and cat.	10.47938231992521
8097. the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial	artery as found in the horse is not clear.	14.05077723263533
8098. however this artery is known	to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal	airways and supportive tissues of the lung.	10.806689460848526
8099. the alveoli and respiratory	bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues.	12.98623016976681
8100. theoretically they	are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding	air or from pulmonary arterial	blood.	9.723773562266802
8101. therefore an explanation of this alveolar	bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased	amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffusing in nature	in the region of the alveolus.	8.10860803254633
8102. if this be true the possibility exists	that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread	degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized	emphysema.	10.875993471418642
8103. one would not expect such an event to occur in animals	possessing lungs of types 1 or 2.	9.544498515510758
8104. the presence of normally	occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first	noted in 1721 by ruysch and thereafter by many others.	11.763405330398179
8105. nakamura	verloop von	hayek have all claimed their normal but	relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being.	9.55759188591782
8106. miller	is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint.	13.037321475654965
8107. in criticism of the latter's	views his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies	in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution	under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored	particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level.	8.054595116758833
8108. as early as 1913	ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs	that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level	when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that	increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative	drop in pulmonary artery pressure.	9.714507408706279
8109. berry brailsford and daly	in 1931 and nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this.	9.345058977386529
8110. our own studies in which	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated	were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure	on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by injecting the pulmonary	artery and vein afterwards.	8.638544486771263
8111. it is distinctly possible therefore	that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered	the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable.	11.56142235613621
8112. this viewpoint is further	supported by verloop's demonstration of thickened bronchial	artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting	as valves.	10.761869065041624
8113. in other words the anastomoses between the bronchial artery	and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand	shunts.	13.295859786868355
8114. in addition little work has been done on a comparative	basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses.	16.73304832610625
8115. verloop found these shunts	in the human being but was unable to find them in rats.	9.39778994459402
8116. ellis grindlay	and edwards also were unable to find them in rats.	10.957705180640192
8117. nakamura	was unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic	or physiologic methods in dogs.	8.968411200837055
8118. the possibility that the absence	or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred.	14.365987694249409
8119. certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one	or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that	species.	8.225835482890563
8120. it is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own	findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially	the dog.	12.227159796506669
8121. in conclusion these findings suggest the need for	a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs.	10.058592376379565
8122. in addition a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized	pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent.	13.44481439770733
8123. also for the present great caution should be exercised in the	choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to	be applied to man.	9.22757125637684
8124. this is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are	to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man.	15.230636965907161
8125. finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be	anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently	known species.	12.005380954752178
8126. the main subgross anatomical features	of the lungs of various mammals are presented.	13.298726768299371
8127. a tabulation of these	features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross	types.	9.670330484383054
8128. type 1 is represented by the cow sheep and pig;	type 2 by the dog cat and monkey; type 3 by the horse.	9.97054730343156
8129. lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1; absent in type	2; imperfectly developed in type 3.	8.29272515769823
8130. the pleura and interlobular	septa are thick in types 1 and 3.	12.957840546200554
8131. the pleura is extremely	thin in type 2 and septa are absent.	11.050834287616778
8132. arterial supply to the pleura	in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery and	in type 2 by the pulmonary artery.	9.271329388213159
8133. in types 1 2 and 3	the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common	with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole.	9.950408994726931
8134. in	type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the	alveolar capillary bed.	10.358652090748608
8135. true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent	form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 although	small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present.	8.180469553502272
8136. well developed respiratory bronchioles on the other hand appear	to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2.	13.494472104091713
8137. in	type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus	and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum.	9.532208636155053
8138. this maybe	due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present.	14.62975866861027
8139. in	type 3 this general relationship is maintained peripherally but	not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path	to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2.	7.542689547924482
8140. some of the features of the top portions of figure 1 and figure	2 were mentioned in discussing table 1.	16.295407172769934
8141. first the onset profile	spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls.	10.740108933856845
8142. in contrast 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile	are bunched and extend over a	much shorter period approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for	girls.	9.949074441911211
8143. the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that	onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion	is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence.	8.212529769504565
8144. second for	both sexes the 21 transverse lines in the onset profile vary more	in individual spread than those in the completion profile.	10.78627012502947
8145. although	the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based	are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early	there are considerable differences in this value between	centers having the closely timed onsets.	7.836278696075707
8146. third the process of calcification	is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these	boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of	children.	10.451470727786948
8147. the onset profile and completion profile are constructed	to serve as norms for children.	10.242653103537407
8148. it is convenient to classify	a child's onset ages and completion ages as advanced moderate	or delayed according to whether the child's	age equivalent dots appeared to the left of upon or	to the right of the appropriate short transverse line.	12.324761827845334
8149. when a dot	appears close to the end of the transverse line the moderate	rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot	with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age.	13.681913602116659
8150. such classifications	may be called somewhat advanced or somewhat delayed	as the case may be reserving moderate for dots upon or close	to the mean.	10.277311992145647
8151. in the lower portion of each chart the skeletal	age of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified.	11.60307017859835
8152. there the middle one of the three curves denotes mean skeletal age	for the maturity series boys and girls.	17.01481083503889
8153. the upper curve denotes	the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents	the mean minus one standard deviation.	9.003374223945919
8154. thus a child's skeletal	age dots may be classified as advanced when they appear above	the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above	or below the middle curve and delayed when they appear below	the lower curve.	9.284839556104194
8155. to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity	chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which	show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level	of growth centers.	9.075516102734882
8156. first the upper portion requires series of films	for every child consisting of those from hand elbow shoulder knee	and foot.	11.076023088234148
8157. the lower portion necessitates only films of hand.	13.611054240998833
8158. second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an	equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones	of the five regions.	9.342951313482567
8159. the lower portion permits comparison of maturity	levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones	are included in hand and wrist as a region.	8.420275648759473
8160. third the upper portion	deals with only two indicators of developmental level onset and	completion.	12.183244542634215
8161. the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate	maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset	and completion.	10.082284143098871
8162. fourth the two indicators are for the most part	widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring	during childhood for all but one growth center.	9.776026287533035
8163. the lower portion provides	a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.	10.994603211347957
8164. onsets	completions and skeletal ages of boy 34 and girl 2	may be directly compared and classified using only those skeletal ages	which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion	profile.	8.443382555482197
8165. it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection	of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small	according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for	centers throughout the body.	9.6874300922679
8166. accordingly maturity level ratings by	means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively	should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessments are dependent	upon onsets during infancy and upon completions during adolescence.	9.541312744408007
8167. it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but	there is substantial agreement.	20.658912088213604
8168. since a skeletal age rating can	be made at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot	as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes	to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood.	10.727366200913007
8169. as stated earlier in the paper onsets and completions-	particularly the former- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy	in osseous development each within a limited age period.	8.374978905760777
8170. such	an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific	periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress.	9.559225930701576
8171. it	was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis	of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth	centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and	2.	8.505356873307889
8172. as one approach to doing this figures 3 and 4 have been constructed	from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for	boy 34 and girl 2.	9.699596211335466
8173. the differences between onset age and completion age	with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition	by means of a series of arrows.	9.272638300062724
8174. the data for boy 34 appear	in figure 3 and for girl 2 in figure 4.	11.311263844877574
8175. the numbering system used	in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth	centers.	8.828385447606417
8176. the dot on one end of each arrow indicates	extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the	corresponding mean age for the growth center.	10.550805859017666
8177. the tip of the	arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion	age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center.	9.595591995364074
8178. thus the	alignment of the dots and tips respectively indicate individual	variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect	to the mean values for these boys and girls.	9.278959384109818
8179. the direction in which	the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was	changed at completion from the level at onset.	8.98052793222422
8180. when the dot	and tip coincide the classification used in this paper is same	schedule.	14.139789064987115
8181. the length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or	acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference	in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale	along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the	original data in the appropriate tables.	7.953267547226351
8182. the difference between	the sequence of onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering	sequence in figures 3 and 4.	11.492181051613539
8183. this difference is readily clarified	by referring to table 1.	13.604873360190716
8184. for example arrow 17 in figure 3 portrays	the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 whereas the same epiphysis	for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in figure 4.	10.257732985553922
8185. for the boy	this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion.	11.139491122895025
8186. thus the span of its ossification was shortened and the center's	ability to catch up in ossification is demonstrated.	11.365391386226362
8187. in	contrast for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at onset	and delayed at completion.	8.62963042412541
8188. obviously the slowing for her may have	occurred at any point between onset and completion.	12.005501282371853
8189. the skeletal	age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that slowing may have	occurred for her during the prepubescent period.	8.935189222267525
8190. length of the shaft	of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation	values for each center in table 1.	11.108215164282347
8191. we have attempted to simplify	the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of	each child- more than 1700 values for the entire group- by constructing	figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34	boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center.	8.59784327336951
8192. figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for	each growth center.	10.162305985298431
8193. forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the	original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this	monograph have been included in the appendix.	9.545599069747125
8194. the principles	used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the	construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the appendix.	10.599891994944592
8195. one growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the second	finger- was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because	epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion	in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the	menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage.	7.848744784922532
8196. its completion	thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include	in studies of growth dietary patterns and health during adolescence.	10.613815357775831
8197. the following summary based on figures 5 and 6 is an	example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset	ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the	appropriate mean age for each growth center.	7.973719098262031
8198. at the top of figure 5	for example the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen	growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and	standard deviation values in table 1.	11.583811695590848
8199. the 34 arrows denoting onset	age plus completion age deviations have been arrayed in an onset	sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the	34 girls.	7.842562774759641
8200. the growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the	second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones.	12.155094761121273
8201. the mean onset age was 25.	15.260583014183545
8202. 3 months and the average	span of the osseous stage was 133 months.	12.527355887668785
8203. the correlation	between onset age and completion age was +.	12.204673387645432
8204. 50 and that between onset	age and span was -.	13.878166952975256
8205. with due consideration for the limits of precision	in assessing expected rate of change in ossification of girls age	2 years and the known variations in rate of ossification of these	children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement each	arrow with a shaft length of four months or less was selected as	indicating same schedule at onset and completion for this particular	epiphysis.	7.097047280639339
8206. accordingly girls 31 29 33 21 26 13 3 4	14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be said to have the same	schedule at onset and completion.	10.843487873198367
8207. it seems clear from	the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in figure 5 that	there was about an equal number of early and late onsets and completions	for the 34 girls.	11.225577505375272
8208. accordingly if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion	occurs in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might	have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification	for the 18 girls with same schedule.	10.404479536982048
8209. as an example of the interpretation	of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft	length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had	a delayed onset and further delayed completion.	10.768298091776314
8210. it is of interest	that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls	in this group.	18.620414079900208
8211. a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boys	would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value	of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage.	7.932152792822336
8212. boys 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 had same schedule at onset	and completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage	would appear possible for only seven boys.	8.859599869593852
8213. boy 34 like girl 2 did not	have same schedule; his arrow crosses the line denoting the	mean.	8.29272515769823
8214. the dot on his arrow indicates early onset and the tip	indicates relatively later completion.	11.636095537390238
8215. after the 42 figures	had been drawn like figures 5 and 6 classifications of the onset	ages and completion ages were summarized from them.	9.219612017067979
8216. interestingly enough the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited	by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and	b.	11.595583738817288
8217. organification	the precise mechanism for organification of iodine	in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood.	10.406722099111738
8218. however the formation	of organically bound iodine mainly mono-iodotyrosine can be	accomplished in cell-free systems.	13.277338463523417
8219. in the absence of additions to the	homogenate the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein	and kirkwood 1953; taurog potter and chaikoff 1955;	taurog potter tong and chaikoff 1956; serif and kirkwood	.	9.35202461627593
8220. this iodoprotein does not	appear	to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there	is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro	by cell-free systems.	11.19391067282235
8221. in addition the iodoamino acid formed in largest	quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine.	13.883989561079305
8222. if tyrosine	and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate	of the thyroid large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can	be formed.	10.475808612214703
8223. it is not clear whether this system	bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system	generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue.	12.319659098105136
8224. on chemical	grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to	f and then to f as the active iodinating species.	11.3267658759633
8225. in the thyroid	gland it appears that proteins are iodinated	and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.	11.269635117119007
8226. iodination of	tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone.	14.54197169776415
8227. the mono-	and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and	thyroxine.	11.572314230763848
8228. the mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail	with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain	di-iodotyrosine analogues.	10.568260720551194
8229. there	is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is	under enzymatic control.	9.599934881973276
8230. the chemical nature of the iodocompounds	is discussed below.	18.208035131740157
8231. little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of	thyroglobulin.	10.884076676961827
8232. its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems	nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in	vitro been unequivocally proven.	9.91479023003372
8233. there is some reason to think that thyroglobulin	synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in	certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially	no iodinated thyroglobulin a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin	has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments	.	10.612023651223783
8234. similar findings have been noted in a patient with	congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue	could only concentrate iodide.	10.450100136969525
8235. in addition depending on availability	of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of	iodine.	13.201869741795111
8236. since the circulating thyroid hormones are	the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine	it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their	release from proteins before secretion.	10.283836024368597
8237. the presence of several proteases	and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid.	12.754831829567818
8238. one of	the proteases has ph optimum of about 3.	16.930564899452293
8239. 7 and another of about 5.	14.11156078930634
8240. the finding that the concentration of one of these proteases	is increased in thyroid glands from tsh-treated animals suggests	that this protease may be active in vivo.	12.142190505439583
8241. there is no conclusive	evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly	purified form nor is their specificity known.	12.844808202798225
8242. a study of their activity	on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released	and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation	of macromolecular intermediates.	10.509531199025869
8243. besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes.	11.82864881442657
8244. a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 and requiring	reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity has been	identified in the thyroid.	9.824429447122283
8245. this de-iodinating enzyme	is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine but does not de-iodinate	thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine.	10.628701801055547
8246. it is assumed that the iodine released	from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid	where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin.	12.591724214014052
8247. the thyroxine	and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping	de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream.	10.017116788685238
8248. it has been	shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine but the binding does not appear	to be particularly strong.	14.644181976737311
8249. it has been suggested that the plasma	thyroxine-binding proteins which have an extremely high affinity for	thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine	.	13.472991674986746
8250. antithyroid drugs are of two	general types.	13.915190642667962
8251. one type has a small univalent anion of the	thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoroboride	type.	12.975174798099733
8252. this ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis	by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid.	12.237996316355508
8253. it does	not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such.	15.043753046630679
8254. the other	group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil.	12.957840546200554
8255. these	drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism but they	inhibit organification.	10.32081168182117
8256. the mechanism of action of these drugs has not	been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing	the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin	.	9.033691828414252
8257. on the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs	of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing	activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular	iodine.	11.681470809702192
8258. any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given	in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing	to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism.	12.488936347866163
8259. the anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased	output of tsh causing the thyroid to enlarge.	8.998955821926716
8260. the effect	of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted	by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet.	10.201372470684875
8261. the antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type however are not antagonised	by such means.	10.242653103537407
8262. besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol	types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring	foods.	13.935541531463011
8263. the most conclusively identified is l-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone	which was isolated from rutabaga.	13.118587711743347
8264. it is presumed	to occur in other members of the brassica family.	26.318430008123002
8265. there is some	evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development	of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia	.	14.200842114640333
8266. there it seems that the goitrogen ingested by	dairy	animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active	goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk.	10.966569661449102
8267. besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of	iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity	of the thyroid gland.	8.971735076809349
8268. in the experimental animal and in man gross	deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and	increased thyroid activity	.	12.516812272569503
8269. in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary	to prevent development of goitre is about 100 |mg per day.	8.59231672095137
8270. with	lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow	enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake	of iodine.	9.550584856950406
8271. further the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction	of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally.	10.481365332798502
8272. in the presence of	a low iodine intake thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with f is found	to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amounts of di-iodotyrosine	and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced.	11.021448821124741
8273. this appears	to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more	rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin.	9.166018824928134
8274. if the deficiency	persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the f label	will reflect the f distribution in the thyroglobulin.	14.289894954223488
8275. similar results	might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions	that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin	proteolysis.	8.90446306396145
8276. the	name thyroid-stimulating hormone has been given to a substance	found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so	far	tested for its presence.	9.486104171575855
8277. the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin	or thyrotrophic hormone.	12.812859666480197
8278. at the present time we do not know by what	biochemical mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid but for bio-assay	of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity	may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase	in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cells	and increase in the thyroidal uptake of f.	0.0
8279. here we shall restrict	discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise	for determining the concentration of tsh in blood.	9.277599693432087
8280. brown	has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying tsh	and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on	the subject.	9.418454839960127
8281. tsh	as long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by niepce	that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid.	8.60977467386111
8282. this connection was clarified by smith and smith who showed	that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate	the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles.	9.712333998600402
8283. the first attempts	to isolate tsh came a decade later when janssen and loeser	used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh	from insoluble impurities.	9.095020937052693
8284. after their work other investigators applied	salt-fractionation techniques to the problem as well as fractionation	with organic solvents such as acetone.	13.746916945307017
8285. albert has concluded	that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period	from 1931 to 1945 were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent	as the starting material.	7.338199913424672
8286. much of this work has been reviewed by	white.	24.181972537530477
8287. developments up to about 1957 have	been discussed by sonenberg.	11.272586159751768
8288. in the last few years	the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the	problem of isolating tsh has led to further purification	.	14.715641608577831
8289. the most	active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators	appear to be similar in potency composition and physical properties.	8.828385447606417
8290. two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in	blood.	13.404683361367372
8291. first is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that	found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored?	10.279432575306602
8292.  second what	is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances	will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction?	10.586611470237468
8293. 	it is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary	tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood	tsh is to be discussed rationally.	8.525917401627602
8294. the importance of knowing in	what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent	observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting tsh in	blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients.	9.960172089828276
8295. whether this	abnormal tsh differs chemically from pituitary tsh or	is alternatively normal tsh with its period of effectiveness	modified	by some other blood constituent cannot be decided without chemical	study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison	of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary	tsh.	7.467238637038142
8296. in evaluating data on the concentration of tsh	in blood one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used	to obtain them.	12.477374245944851
8297. the introduction of the united states pharmacopoeia	reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the	usp and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have	made it possible to compare results published by different investigators	since that time.	9.425361654498104
8298. we should like to re-emphasise the importance of	stating results solely in terms of international units of tsh activity	and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units.	11.869851428166019
8299. for	the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since	a.	9.156393179952055
8300. standard preparations	the international	unit	adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different	laboratories has been defined as the	amount of activity present in 13.	9.3548994422792
8301. 5 mg of the international standard	preparation.	19.556312557672953
8302. the international unit is equipotent with the usp	unit adopted in 1952 which was defined as the amount of activity	present in 20 mg of the usp reference substance.	10.120466999967386
8303. muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though	serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic	adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use.	8.546574077408936
8304. although biopsies have	shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced	weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which	necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle	groups.	9.907253512146301
8305. the case described in this paper is that of an older man	who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of	steroids for a refractory anemia.	9.718488358873435
8306. this patient	was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the new york hospital	for his fourth and terminal admission on june 26 1959 because	of disabling weakness and general debility.	9.850038772461819

8313. therapy included digitalization and	anticoagulation.	14.19641732877796
8314. later chlorothiazide and salt restriction became	necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure.	12.490499769385742
8315. because of increasing anemia triamcinolone 8 mg daily was started	on feb 23 1958 and was continued until july 1958.	10.778171304285642

8324. 9 gm by dec 1 1958 the weakness in the pelvic and	quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse and it became difficult	for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position.	8.395126638536944
8325. triamcinolone 16 mg daily was resumed and maintained until feb	18 1959.	9.345058977386529
8326. chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period but there	was no change in the muscle weakness.	11.110676278631656
8327. at this time a detailed	neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was	moderate in the hands and feet but marked in the shoulders hips and	pelvic girdle with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes.	11.491378467945335

8341. in spite of normal thyroid function tests a trial of propylthiouracil	400 mg daily for one week was given but served only	to intensify muscle weakness.	10.753434123840853
8342. repeated attempts to withdraw steroids	entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted	as well as fever malaise anorexia anxiety and an exacerbation of	the anemia.	9.178287773963142

8430. after blotting out most of the saline around the sections a drop	of f was layered over each of the sections allowed to react for 30	minutes and then washed with pbs for 15-30 minutes.	10.362269833590025
8431. after blotting	out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted	in buffered glycerine.	11.235194523519235
8432. after drying the sections under the fan fixing	in acetone and drying at 37` as in the indirect method the sections	were treated with conjugated f or f	for 5-30 minutes.	9.997233266699357
8433. as controls other sections were similarly	treated with f or conjugated antiserum to the new york strain of	potato yellow-dwarf virus.	10.92209644763183
8434. the sections	were then washed with pbs for 15-30 minutes and mounted in buffered	glycerine.	12.010194183656237
8435. stained or unstained sections	were examined under dark field illumination in a zeiss fluorescence	microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp	.	8.629504189654918
8436. the light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard	thickness corning 1840 filter.	11.636095537390238
8437. in the eyepiece a wratten 2 b	filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light.	12.374685531681331
8438. a red filter	zeiss barrier filter with the code designation bg	23 was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast	between specific and nonspecific fluorescence.	10.930676781976448
8439. _specificity	of staining in the first few experiments	f was passed through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed	twice with 50-100 mg sweet clover tissue powder.	9.194600571164571
8440. the intermediate	sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder.	14.310793878502059
8441. sections of sweet	clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1:10 solution of f	for 30 minutes washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes stained with	f for 30 minutes and washed for 15 minutes in pbs.	7.142710418034184
8442. such sections	showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells	of the pseudophloem tissue.	12.249273336341776
8443. this specific fluorescence	was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence	in consecutive sections stained with 1:10 dilution of ns	and f or with f alone.	8.899337207446726
8444. unstained sections mounted in buffered	glycerine or sections treated only with ns or f did not show	such green fluorescence.	9.412054727957594
8445. sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained	with either f and f or ns and f also showed only the light	green nonspecific fluorescence.	7.9721504870064175
8446. however the nonspecific staining	by the f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused	with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen.	10.560606603659147
8447. two absorptions of f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of f	ns and f with	crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder did not further improve	the specificity of staining.	7.573297669553672
8448. treatment of all the sera with sweet	clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence especially when	the treated conjugate was diluted to 1:2 with 0.	10.189773508540501
8449. in	all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were diluted to	1:10 or 1:100 with 0.	8.518314539970453
8450. 85% saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence	were not appreciably reduced whereas a dilution of the intermediate	sera to 1:500 or diluting the f to 1:5 greatly reduced	specific fluorescence.	8.562540869981424
8451. rinsing the sections with pbs before	layering	the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction.	8.62963042412541
8452. in addition	to other treatments treating the sections with normal sheep serum	for half an hour before layering f did not reduce nonspecific staining.	12.115391619130113
8453. the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could	be satisfactorily	removed was by passing the conjugate through a deae-cellulose	column.	10.116763491122398
8454. when 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column	the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the	most	specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and	very little in others.	9.29962166945162
8455. in the latter cases an additional treatment of	the deae-cellulose-treated f with 50 mg of sweet clover stem	tissue powder further improved the specificity.	10.842944265012706
8456. after these treatments	the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues	or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable	from the bright yellow-green specific staining.	9.224033707995556
8457. with this purified	conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections	with 1:10 dilution of f for 30 minutes washing with pbs	for 15 minutes staining with f for 30 minutes and washing with	pbs for 15 minutes.	8.180352123803262
8458. the specificity of staining in wtv tumors	with f and f but not with ns and f or with antiserum to	potato yellow-dwarf virus and f and the absence of such staining	in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover indicate that an antigen	of wtv was being stained.	8.879915016112317
8459. f was first conjugated	with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin.	9.731019113036988
8460. this conjugate	was passed twice through dowex-2-chloride and treated with various	tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method.	14.617318219328437
8461. in all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still	present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence.	11.638380948242682
8462. in later experiments f and f were prepared by conjugating	8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin.	12.121170212920106
8463. these conjugates	f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate	while the specific staining	was similar in both cases.	8.952853542176154
8464. nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily	eliminated by passing these conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column as described for f.	9.723773562266802
8465. the best staining procedure with	this purified f consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30	minutes and washing in pbs for 15 minutes.	8.932319613626158
8466. the specificity of	staining with f was established as follows: f specifically stained	tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or	of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover.	9.11199125168746
8467. sections of tumors incited	by wtv were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum	or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus.	7.9139724503302755
8468. after	passing f through deae-cellulose the titer of antibodies to	wtv in the specific fraction was 1:4 of the titer before such	passage; but mere dilution	of the conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific	staining.	8.389509018975968
8469. this indicates that increase in specificity of f after	passing it through deae-cellulose was not merely due to dilution.	10.248165358983352
8470. specific staining by deae-cellulose treated f	and f although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either	nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells was not satisfactorily	photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts	with black and white and color photography.	9.345687187884769
8471. this was chiefly because	of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells.	13.138227279707598
8472. the autofluorescence	from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant.	13.742820434427895
8473. results of specific staining by the	direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization	of wtv antigen in certain tissues of tumors.	7.556878632736834
8474. the virus antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue.	15.227221353292695
8475. frequently a few isolated	thick-walled cells or rarely groups of such cells in the xylem region	were also specifically stained but there was no such staining	in epidermis cortex most xylem cells ray cells or pith.	8.314105917133778
8476. within	the pseudophloem cells the distribution of wtv antigen was	irregular in the cytoplasm.	10.635267499930531
8477. no antigen was detectable in certain dark	spherical areas in most cells.	10.875765345688361
8478. these areas are thought to represent	the	nuclei.	16.52844398169888
8479. in some tumor sections small spherical bodies possibly inclusion	bodies stained more intensely than	the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen.	9.62556327046669
8480. in all cases	studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not	contain detectable amounts of wtv antigen.	13.049271005164194
8481. in	both the direct and indirect methods of staining the conjugates had	nonspecifically staining fractions.	8.834168570742513
8482. in the indirect method this was	evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green	even when stained with ns and f or with f only.	12.166968346266756
8483. in the direct	method f not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy	sweet clover stems nonspecifically and wtv tumor sections were similarly	stained by comparable f.	9.364904215656267
8484. after f and f were passed through	dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover	tissue powder nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing	amount of such staining was still present.	9.449134571619465
8485. treatment of the conjugates	with ethyl acetate and the conjugates	with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown	gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily	remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates.	7.888593790351962
8486. such	treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating	nonspecific staining in several other systems.	9.908939338115298
8487. schramm	and ro^ttger did not report any such nonspecific staining	of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco	mosaic virus.	8.026882005052693
8488. the reason for the failure of these treatments to	eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not	known.	14.017740139441745
8489. in our work the best procedure for removing substances	causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was	to pass the conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column and in some cases to absorb the first and second	milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.	8.673768646822621
8490. the	specific	staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that wtv antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled	cells in the xylem region but was not detectable in any other	tissues of the root and stem tumors.	8.759258420692062
8491. a study of the distribution of wtv	antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly	distributed in the cytoplasm.	11.732400263059478
8492. wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper	transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation	.	10.635267499930531
8493. the concentration	and	apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue	of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies	in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order	to infect plants.	8.029292989821958
8494. since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on	individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex	symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from	the cortex.	9.468940388304102
8495. in experiments with topical application of strychnine on	the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the	hypothalamus was demonstrated.	9.0082069863666
8496. moreover the responsiveness of the	hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these	conditions.	13.236603638518075
8497. even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms	of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey a on seeing	monkey b in emotional stress.	9.548041561958026
8498. a previously	extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey a	and was associated	with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic	discharges.	10.331010770606548
8499. it seems to follow that by and large an antagonism	exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity	is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines	the emotional responsiveness of the organism.	12.49870814283853
8500. in addition the	neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates as	mirsky's interesting experiment on the communication of affect	demonstrates.	12.8381364314819
8501. but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals	such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus	and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex.	9.74404236748177
8502. maclean stressed	correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of	the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the	limbic brain on emotions related to fight	and flight and also on sexual functions.	9.321294176849179
8503. it should be added that in	man	neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion	of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory	imagination and creativity.	13.145984558394908
8504. previous experiences are obviously	of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional	response.	10.768144413760142
8505. the visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute	to memory but this topic is beyond the scope of this	paper.	11.23399094109102
8506. after	this brief discussion of neo- paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic	relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance	and its physiological and pathological significance.	11.207031565446147
8507. facilitatory	processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending	and descending pathways.	9.345058977386529
8508. thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical	application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate	with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive	discharges.	10.434331718749856
8509. on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic	excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior	hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of	cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored.	9.875261654285836
8510. apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus	and the cerebral cortex.	11.577163625873421
8511. consequently if for any reason	the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level the	lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state	of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal	discharges.	7.366112434601837
8512. obviously a vicious cycle develops.	17.502090062482328
8513. this tendency can	be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or	via cortico-hypothalamic pathways.	11.048524854601355
8514. it is believed that drug therapy	and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.	18.342891621691304
8515. before we comment further on these pathological conditions	we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within	physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness.	11.13694861214636
8516. thus	a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep	and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous eeg	potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition.	9.719549253459439
8517. moreover	the dominance in parasympathetic action	at the hypothalamic level induces by its peripheral	action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the	cortex a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus	of the somatic nervous system.	6.998153343071019
8518. with the dominance of the sympathetic	division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur.	14.039868727048155
8519. since	electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects	of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces	sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is	altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus.	9.594409311265132
8520. similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes	in man and animals.	10.997381872685297
8521. of particular importance is the study of	the actions of drugs in this respect.	11.217676852785006
8522. although no drugs act exclusively	on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity	to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic	side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance.	11.493185981433875
8523. the	former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers.	9.669550099771405
8524. specific differences exist in the action of different drugs	belonging to the same group as for instance between reserpine and	chlorpromazine.	11.210937047642547
8525. important as these differences are they should not	obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently	to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas	a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually	maniclike changes.	7.8088516261367245
8526. the emotional states produced by drugs influence	the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner; synchrony	prevails in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration	of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and	psychoactive drugs.	8.990657176580374
8527. the shock therapies act likewise on the	hypothalamic balance.	12.98623016976681
8528. physiological experiments and clinical observations	have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled	hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges.	9.412054727957594
8529. they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side.	13.675029337880355
8530. this explains	the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions	and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the	sympathetic system as shown by the mecholyl test.	10.271457873915677
8531. some investigators	have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic	reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated	by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and	increasing deviation of this test from the norm.	7.7286853934399655
8532. nevertheless the	theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has	a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients	has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients.	9.620027728865434
8533. the	mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are	reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake	of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect	of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions	additional tests seem to be desirable.	7.445358559499072
8534. it was assumed that the	shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in	neuropsychiatric	patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures	follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle.	11.924960844221472
8535. a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal	individual to sleep or in special circumstances to cardiovascular	collapse or nausea and vomiting.	10.048704921918965
8536. in both conditions the emotional and	perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such	as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs.	10.409457513289171
8537. the	fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states	of parasympathetic dominance remain to be	elucidated.	9.070074471681158
8538. perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies	in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges	which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative	alterations in reactivity.	10.70691390870394
8539. a state of parasympathetic tuning	of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase	in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and	reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal:	a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in	this state of tuning a parasympathetic response! furthermore conditioned	reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic	reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level and several types	of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic	tuning are observed.	7.090907107800695
8540. if for instance such a change is	produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks previously	inhibited conditioned reactions reappear.	11.50643111902816
8541. however if these procedures	are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily	abolished.	11.24027360493682
8542. in other studies loss of differentiation in previously	established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive	treatments suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance	between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes.	10.60362563806816
8543. it has	further been shown that: an experimental neurosis in its initial	stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic	balance; drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned	reactions; in a state of depression the positive conditioned	stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased	synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing	effect on the eeg.	8.36836919327225
8544. these are few and seemingly disjointed data	but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations	in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic	balance has been altered by physiological experimentation	pharmacological action or clinical processes.	9.859882032512491
8545. basis of some form of psychotherapy	the foregoing remarks	imply	that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads	between physiological and pathological forms of emotion.	8.06754560804923
8546. if this is	the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just	mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional	state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise.	10.615307755451322
8547. we	pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders	and neurotic symptoms particularly in certain types of personality	but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion	may cure a battle neurosis.	7.701955196710339
8548. this phenomenon raises the question	whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not	have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses.	13.185858534440685
8549. being	a strictly	physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional	information on the nature of the emotional process itself.	10.82349552270819
8550. wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area.	11.793662721363662
8551. he showed	convincingly that anxiety is a learned reaction and	is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed therefore	that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional	and reversible.	8.542074198396636
8552. an important observation of pavlov served as a	guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means.	10.315426272035957
8553. in	a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding	and pain.	10.343365272312113
8554. a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus	and was followed by feeding.	13.093226230968375
8555. the pain became thus the symbol for food	and elicited salivary secretion.	13.189738331969258
8556. even when the	intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke	any signs of pain.	12.446307648658244
8557. since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental	neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental	situation wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism	to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding.	8.160557742896872
8558. appropriate	experiments showed that this is indeed possible.	18.101123248550408
8559. he then applied	this	principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses.	14.959049197918635
8560. he took advantage	of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety	and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former	attitude was established.	10.775902992950398
8561. for the interpretation of these significant	investigations it should be remembered that reciprocal relations	exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions	which are closely associated with the emotions.	11.025526032179066
8562. the feeding-pain	antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the	tropho- and ergotropic systems.	14.013097269053157
8563. furthermore a functional antagonism	exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety.	10.390688629482147
8564. although	in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic-somatic	patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively	as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state	of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test.	9.382822366780594
8565. the psychological incompatibility	of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based	on this marked difference.	11.611325356979146
8566. in	our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological	range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity	of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system	and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively.	9.513972793692707
8567. we stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with	respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding	the hypothalamic-cortical discharge.	9.996542866299398
8568. although we are still far from	a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation	it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent	changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for	major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions	in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and	clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents.	8.86144522731681
8569. in view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in	the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism	observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several	instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may	play an important role in initiating mental changes.	8.26693574357693
8570. we are trying to study a	linear operator t on the finite-dimensional space v	by decomposing t into a direct sum of operators which are in some	sense elementary.	11.852037784779972
8571. we can do this through the characteristic values	and vectors of t in certain special cases ie when the	minimal polynomial for t factors over the scalar field f	into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1.	9.160331828588069
8572. what can	we do with the general t?	20.01310572990112
8573.  if we try to study t using	characteristic values we are confronted with two problems.	13.22717774134964
8574. first	t may not have a single characteristic value; this is really	a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically	closed.	12.786357219706304
8575. second even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely	over f into a product of polynomials of degree 1 there	may not be enough characteristic vectors for t to span the	space v; this is clearly a deficiency in t.	7.481491106714898
8576. the second	situation is illustrated by the operator t on f	represented in the standard basis by f.	11.998578734473432
8577. the characteristic	polynomial for a is f and this is plainly also the minimal	polynomial for a.	11.40764818709436
8578. thus t is not	diagonalizable.	21.600906893634505
8579. one sees that this happens because the null space of	f has dimension 1 only.	10.372214173598586
8580. on the other hand the null space of f and	the null space of f together span v the former being the	subspace spanned by f and the latter the subspace spanned by f and	f.	12.316931278832557
8581. this will be more or less our general method for the second	problem.	15.83318059206126
8582. if the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes f where f are distinct elements of f	then we shall show that the space v is the direct sum	of the null spaces of f.	10.5618017121274
8583. the diagonalizable operator is the special	case of this in which f for each i.	10.506091151910438
8584. the theorem which we prove	is more general than what we have described since it works with the	primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes	which enter are all of first degree.	10.393033589006087
8585. the reader will find it helpful	to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 and	even more particularly to think of the proof of theorem 10 a special	case of this theorem.	9.2204436734497
8586. let t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional	vector space v over the field f.	11.82128382543295
8587. let p be the	minimal polynomial for t f where the f are distinct irreducible	monic polynomials over f and the f are positive integers.	8.556034406053657
8588. let f be the null space of f.	16.328528736642056
8589. then each f	is invariant under t if f is the operator induced on	f by t	then the minimal polynomial for f is f.	8.346263634704133
8590. the idea of the proof is this.	30.592374101812457
8591. if the direct-sum decomposition	is valid how can we get hold of the projections f associated with	the decomposition?	12.149063417512485
8592.  the projection f will be the identity on f	and zero on the other f.	15.697519742710591
8593. we shall find a polynomial f such that	f is the identity on f and is zero on the other f and so that	f etc.	10.02802756498288
8594. for each i let f.	21.210891547220445
8595. since f are distinct	prime polynomials the polynomials f are relatively prime	.	10.944171083508989
8596. thus there are polynomials f such that f.	18.254180161043408
8597. note	also that if f then f is divisible by the polynomial p	because f contains each f as a factor.	7.9139724503302755
8598. we shall show that the polynomials	f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of	the proof.	14.776192737318008
8599. since f and p divides f for f	we have f.	11.452680728570563
8600. thus the f are projections which correspond to some	direct-sum decomposition of the space v.	13.257036855245726
8601. we wish to show that	the range of f is exactly the subspace f.	13.632475687916575
8602. it is clear that each	vector in the range of f is in f for if |a is in the range of	f then f and so f because f is divisible by the minimal polynomial	p.	13.018768078520772
8603. conversely suppose that |a is in the null space	of f.	11.294690924375328
8604. if f then f is divisible by f and so f ie	f.	13.730677191955854
8605. but then it is immediate that f ie that |a is in	the range of f.	13.028846857856609
8606. this completes the proof of statement.	18.474861091230572
8607. it is certainly clear that the subspaces f are invariant under t.	17.98847078596751
8608. if f is the operator induced on f by t then evidently	f because by definition f is 0 on the subspace f.	10.475808612214703
8609. this shows	that the minimal polynomial for f divides f.	12.508271769542546
8610. conversely let	g be any polynomial such that f.	12.3482207866056
8611. thus f is divisible	by the minimal polynomial p of t ie f	divides f.	9.986548270675279
8612. it is easily seen that f divides g.	25.534055066432398
8613. hence the	minimal polynomial for f is f.	13.489211709123447
8614. if f are the	projections associated with the primary decomposition of t then	each f is a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear	operator u commutes with t then u commutes with	each of the f ie each subspace f is invariant under u.	9.040532704130202
8615. in the notation of the proof of theorem 12 let us take a	look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t	is a product of first-degree polynomials ie the case in	which	each f is of the form f.	8.654679628661897
8616. now the range of f is the null space	f of f.	16.32957990662074
8617. by theorem 10 d is a diagonalizable	operator which we shall call the	of t.	9.925947936808365
8618. let us look at the operator f.	32.293942241596824
8619. now f f so f.	16.5381575797386
8620. the reader	should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that	f and in general that f.	11.576049404322346
8621. when f for each i we shall have	f because the operator f will then be 0 on the range of f.	10.943333132166
8622. let n be a linear operator on the vector	space v.	14.406279441788152
8623. we say that n is if there	is some positive integer r such that f.	11.030116539476264
8624. let	t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector	space v over the field f.	10.11881746645696
8625. suppose that the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes over f into a product of linear	polynomials.	10.575398802047284
8626. then there is a diagonalizable operator d on	v and a nilpotent operator n on v such that	f f.	15.468912175857662
8627. the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent	operator n are uniquely determined by	and	each of them is a polynomial in t.	9.691087093183036
8628. we have just observed	that we can write f where d is diagonalizable and n	is nilpotent and where d and n not only commute	but are polynomials in t.	10.944449747907209
8629. now suppose that we also have f	where d' is diagonalizable n' is nilpotent and	f.	10.297742215329936
8630. we shall prove that f.	26.307813800402375
8631. since d' and n'	commute with one another and f we see that d' and n'	commute with t.	9.918095631736247
8632. thus d' and n'	commute with any polynomial in t; hence they commute with d	and with n.	10.791879857090677
8633. now we have f or f and all four of these	operators commute with one another.	12.069765666834872
8634. since d and d'	are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously	diagonalizable and f is diagonalizable.	10.946756482514818
8635. since n and n'	are both nilpotent and they commute the operator f is nilpotent;	for using the fact that n and n' commute f	and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression	for f will be 0.	7.804184469489372
8636. space must have its nth power 0; if we take f	above that will be large enough.	10.891757186023181
8637. it then follows that f is large	now f is	a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent.	12.031351111735999
8638. such an operator	is obviously the zero operator; for since it is nilpotent the minimal	polynomial for this operator is of the form f for some f; but	then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial cannot	have a repeated root; hence f and the minimal polynomial is simply	x which says the operator is 0.	8.881663548984045
8639. thus we see that f and	f.	16.01423739805074
8640. let v be a finite-dimensional vector	space over an algebraically closed field f eg the field	of complex numbers.	11.214021750151435
8641. then every linear operator t on v	can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and	a nilpotent operator n which commute.	8.804757496643045
8642. these operators d	and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t.	12.054801984109547
8643. from these results one sees that the study of linear operators	on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced	to the study of nilpotent operators.	10.160731195382228
8644. for vector spaces over non-algebraically	closed fields we still need to find some substitute for	characteristic values and vectors.	11.067689702677868
8645. it is a very interesting fact that	these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we	shall do in the next chapter.	17.008042376048834
8646. in concluding this section we	should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of	the primary decomposition theorem.	11.998763113158269
8647. we have chosen to give it at the	end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus	is not purely linear algebra.	11.522325921214087
8648. in the primary decomposition	theorem it is not necessary that the vector space v	be finite dimensional nor is it necessary for parts that	p be the	minimal polynomial for t.	14.386505725359722
8649. if t is a linear operator	on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial	p such that f then parts of theorem 12 are valid	for t with the proof which we gave.	8.45691224033284
8650. let n be	a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times	continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which	satisfy the differential equation f where f are some fixed constants.	9.029680097547764
8651. if f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable	functions then the space v of solutions of this differential	equation is a subspace of f.	8.66205458455769
8652. if d denotes the differentiation	operator and p is the polynomial f then v	is the null space of the operator p because f simply says	f.	10.156836957998584
8653. let us now regard d as a linear operator on the subspace	v.	12.425617033764881
8654. if we are discussing differentiable complex-valued	functions then f and v are complex vector spaces	and f may be any complex numbers.	13.157116492035204
8655. we now write f where f are	distinct complex numbers.	14.64188395417454
8656. if f is the null space of f then theorem	12 says that f.	13.174092110103674
8657. in other words if f satisfies the differential	equation f then f is uniquely expressible in the	form f where f satisfies the differential equation f.	10.132478222914289
8658. thus the	study of the solutions to the equation f is reduced to the study of	the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form f.	9.687095292432488
8659. this	reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra	ie	by the primary decomposition theorem.	8.790453664685133
8660. to describe	the space of solutions to f one must know something about differential	equations that is one must know something about d other	than the fact that it is a linear operator.	13.52477883484515
8661. however one does not	need to know very much.	13.91471515037738
8662. it is very easy to establish by induction on	r that if f is in f then f that is f etc.	14.094015787542169
8663. thus	f if and only if f.	11.867291106449708
8664. a function g such that f ie	f must be a polynomial function of degree f or less: f.	11.147759703402327
8665. thus f satisfies f if and only if f has the form f.	9.986548270675279
8666. accordingly the 'functions' f span the space of solutions of	f.	12.550940762835245
8667. since f are linearly independent functions and the exponential	function has no zeros these r functions f form a basis for	the space of solutions.	8.250001315226967
8668. some experiments are composed	of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible	outcomes.	12.077597585951064
8669. the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation	that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment	to another.	9.284471502198071
8670. we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not	only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real	life phenomena but also because it has important properties that recur	in many other probability models.	11.076970494934635
8671. we begin with a few examples of	binomial experiments.	21.334040612605758
8672. a trained marksman	shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions	may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times.	9.68609254411232
8673. in repeated sets of	five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary.	12.740239907977159
8674. what can we say of the	probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes?	14.88559780900782
8675. 	in litters of eight mice from similar parents	the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer	from 0 to 8.	7.556878632736834
8676. what probabilities should be attached to these possible	outcomes?	15.928823468405662
8677.   when three dice are	tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of aces is	0?	15.84905384175131
8678.   more generally	suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials	that each trial results in either a success or a non-success	and that the probability of success remains constant	from trial to trial.	10.917290120332748
8679. in the examples above the occurrence of	a bull's-eye	a straight-haired mouse or an ace could be called a success.	11.055492295104097
8680. in general any outcome we choose may be labeled success.	16.647649420695988
8681. the major question in this chapter is: what is the probability	of exactly x successes in n trials?	10.670913421871939
8682.    in	chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples	usually by counting points in a sample space.	10.717572138926874
8683. fortunately a general	formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind.	9.853474320796117
8684. before	deriving this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this	kind.	11.134338369156042
8685. experiments are often composed of several identical	trials and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated.	8.834168570742513
8686. in the marksmanship	example a trial consists of one round shot at a target	with outcome either one bull's-eye.	12.88628409926433
8687. further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets	of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several	repetitions of the five-round experiment.	8.92026116017114
8688. if three dice are tossed	a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of	three trials.	11.532573089789551
8689. or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed	three times each toss is a trial and the three tosses form the experiment.	9.7937883317658
8690. mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of	three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times.	10.655032594249247
8691. these	examples are illustrative of the use of the words trial and experiment	as they are used in this chapter but they are quite flexible	example	ten students act as managers for	a high-school football team and of these managers a proportion p	are licensed drivers.	9.529393743782231
8692. each friday one manager is chosen by lot to	stay late and load the equipment on a truck.	10.368838023740587
8693. on three fridays the coach	has needed a driver.	14.278231204919473
8694. considering only these fridays what is the	probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times?	10.544680565616892
8695.  exactly 2 times?	16.13502295689442
8696. 	1 time?	22.4402793574494
8697.  0 time?	19.137741945722095
8698.   note that there are 3 trials	of interest.	19.720250695384625
8699. each trial consists of choosing a student manager at	random.	11.469542930445392
8700. the 2 possible outcomes on each trial are driver or nondriver.	12.957840546200554
8701. since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of	different trials are independent.	12.132299137880901
8702. the managers stay the same so that	f is the same for all weeks.	13.608564875471531
8703. we now generalize these ideas for general	binomial experiments.	15.817692488572204
8704. for an experiment to qualify as a	binomial experiment it must have four properties: there must	be a fixed number of trials each trial must result in a success	or a failure all trials must have	identical probabilities of success the trials must be independent	of each other.	9.363309638966076
8705. below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate	these four properties.	9.921491997845004
8706. we also give for each property an example	where the property is absent.	13.668410152011944
8707. the language and notation introduced	1.	18.305288520168446
8708. there must be a fixed	number n of repeated trials.	29.48128630482172
8709. we study sets	of five shots; for the mice we restrict attention to litters	experiment	toss a die until an ace appears.	9.177814579120218
8710. here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number.	15.600926476648935
8711. each of the n trials is either a success	or a failure.	14.615648888875814
8712. success and failure are just convenient	labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial	trials in general.	10.971517185859145
8713. these words are more expressive than labels like	a and not-a.	10.934375625160019
8714. it is natural from the marksman's	viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success but in the mice example	it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse.	12.430124877052299
8715. the word binomial means of two names or of two terms	and both usages apply in our work: the first to the names of the	two outcomes of a binomial trial and the second to the terms p	and f that represent the probabilities of success and failure.	8.325938186800562
8716. sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial	we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die	where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes ace and not-ace.	10.960268488642232
8717. we classify	mice as straight-haired or wavy-haired but a hairless	mouse appears.	12.334327972181923
8718. we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the	animal as not constituting a trial but such a solution is not always	satisfactory.	11.254115916233568
8719. each die has probability f of producing an ace; the marksman	has some probability p perhaps 0.	9.031710412997498
8720. 1 of making a bull's-eye.	20.742888508802228
8721. note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment	to be binomial.	14.459593369082356
8722. during	a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles	4.	10.473659558052681
8723. this means that the probability	for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by	multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the	single binomial trials.	10.097373545885846
8724. thus in the three-dice example f f and	the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three	dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order is.	10.842838099002737
8725. experimentally	we expect independence when the trials have nothing to	do with one another.	9.070074471681158
8726. a family	of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains	and a coin is tossed to decide.	11.400490562721124
8727. we want to know the number of people	going to the mountains.	22.109683320594556
8728. when this experiment is viewed as composed	of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes	of the trials are obviously not independent.	13.50888209489294
8729. indeed the experiment	is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire	family.	10.44740216492636
8730. the following is a less extreme example of dependence.	15.814228954590824
8731. consider	couples visiting an art museum.	12.851133807717682
8732. each person votes for one of a pair	of pictures to receive a popular prize.	14.891166759973709
8733. voting for one picture may	be called success for the other failure.	9.345058977386529
8734. an experiment	consists of the voting of one couple or two trials.	12.190172349217661
8735. in repetitions	of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons	in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because	couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar	tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population	of visitors.	7.600778585203075
8736. table 7-1 illustrates the point.	15.068811854765874
8737. the table shows	that 0.	19.440309286487764
8738. 6 of the boys and 0.	20.688970118931937
8739. 6 of the girls vote for picture a.	11.026304283168889
8740. therefore under independent voting f or 0.	14.3370853461226
8741. 36 of the couples would	cast two votes for picture a and f or 0.	8.62963042412541
8742. 16 would cast	two votes for picture b.	13.037321475654965
8743. thus in independent voting f or 0.	17.78279999029785
8744. 52	of the couples would agree.	15.068811854765874
8745. but table 7-1 shows that f or 0.	14.594994348557169
8746. 70 agree	too many for independent voting.	13.915190642667962
8747. each performance of an n-trial	binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0	through n as the value of the random variable x where	f.	9.766050670718496
8748. we want to study the probability function of this random variable.	21.241361419394742
8749. for example we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes	not which shots were bull's-eyes.	17.26314922177074
8750. a binomial experiment can produce	random variables other than the number of successes.	15.302082980166126
8751. for example the	marksman gets 5 shots but we take his score to be the number of shots	before his first bull's-eye that is 0 1 2 3 4	.	10.068940143504115
8752. thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes	and the random variable is not the number of successes.	16.225550835173998
8753. the constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most	likely to give trouble in practice.	9.403879097775112
8754. obviously very slight changes	in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of	independence may not make an appreciable difference.	9.427974141801842
8755. on the	other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical	phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used	as a baseline for comparative purposes; that is we may discuss the	to	a binomial experiment consists of f independent	binomial trials all with the same probability f of yielding a success.	7.9537569399772305
8756. the outcome of the experiment is x successes.	20.771021187880773
8757. the random	variable x takes the values f with probabilities f or more	briefly f.	10.242653103537407
8758. we shall find a formula for the probability of	exactly x successes for given values of p and n.	11.821886777400366
8759. when	each number of successes x is paired with its probability of	occurrence f the set of pairs f is a probability function called	a binomial distribution.	7.485565382198017
8760. the choice of p and n determines	the binomial distribution uniquely and different choices always	produce different distributions	.	13.634792312742848
8761. the set of all binomial distributions is	called the family of binomial distributions but in general discussions	this expression is often shortened to the binomial distribution	or even the binomial when the context is clear.	8.566460149488295
8762. binomial distributions	were treated by james bernoulli about 1700 and for this	random	each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces	either 0 or 1 success.	8.951887347307554
8763. therefore each binomial trial can be thought	of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that	trial and taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities q and	p respectively.	7.602649629784502
8764. the several trials of a binomial experiment	produce a new random variable x the total number of successes	which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single	trials.	10.789547618749877
8765. the marksman gets two bull's-eyes one	on his third shot and one on his fifth.	9.923610580026844
8766. the numbers of successes on	the five individual shots are then 0 0 1 0 1.	11.311263844877574
8767. the number of successes	on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0	or 1 and there are 5 such random variables here.	10.661887125201767
8768. their sum is x	the total number of successes which in this experiment has the	value f.	11.248667991873138
8769. consider a simple closed plane curve c which is a real-analytic	image of the unit circle and which is given by f.	9.766217542363774
8770. these	are real analytic periodic functions with period t.	13.269026768804823
8771. in the	following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly	an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does	not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares.	8.65227633996835
8772. this theorem	is similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exists a circumscribing	cube around any closed bounded convex set in f.	10.522982683227314
8773. the latter theorem	has been generalized by yamabe and yujobo and cairns to show	that in f there are families of such cubes.	9.204535066826105
8774. here for the case of	squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity	and give certain other results.	11.136237595696763
8775. a square inscribed in a curve	c means a square with its four corner points on the curve	though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c.	8.684982572212252
8776. indeed	the spiral f with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses	only one inscribed square.	11.746734488593594
8777. the square has one corner point on	the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior.	9.809194276530757
8778. on c from the point p at f to the point q	at f we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side	erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square	is inside c.	10.851927479987062
8779. as s increases we consider the two free	corner points of the square f and f adjacent to p and q	respectively.	11.196993378609163
8780. as s approaches t the square will	be outside c and therefore both f and f must cross c	an odd number of times as s varies from zero to t.	9.726864139345512
8781. the points may also touch c without crossing.	12.98623016976681
8782. suppose	f crosses c when f.	15.068811854765874
8783. we now have certain squares with three	corners on c.	19.267783202548856
8784. for any such square the middle corner of these	will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the	curve will be called the diagonal point of the square.	10.381238245914378
8785. each point on	c as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal	points by the above construction.	8.674598099376816
8786. to each paired vertex	and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point	ie the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c	from the vertex in the direction of increasing t.	9.926502156537788
8787. if the	vertex is at f and if the interior of c is on the left as	one moves in the direction of increasing t then every such corner	can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c clockwise	through 90` about the vertex.	8.986899945277479
8788. the set of intersections of f	the rotated curve with the original curve c consists of just	the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex	at f plus the vertex itself.	9.119405592415676
8789. we note that two such curves c	and f cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points;	otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which	is impossible since they do not coincide near f.	8.799406575635128
8790. with each	vertex we associate certain numerical values namely the set of positive	differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding	forward corner points.	9.799555112523436
8791. for the vertex at f these values	will be denoted by f.	13.26023821368638
8792. the function f defined in this way	is multi-valued.	15.227221353292695
8793. we consider now the graph of the function	f on f.	12.334327972181923
8794. we will refer to the plane of c and f as	the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane.	19.103218660714294
8795. the graph as a set may have a finite number of components.	11.7798180242243
8796. we	will denote the values of f on different components by f.	11.861395293808751
8797. each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection	between c and f.	9.488206357758456
8798. there are two types of such intersections	depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point	of intersection.	15.576478642556669
8799. an ordinary point will be any point of intersection	a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane	f meets both the interior and the exterior of c.	8.215161188230365
8800. any other point of intersection between c and f will be called	a tangent point.	11.11838066201103
8801. this terminology will also be applied to the	corresponding points in the f-plane.	15.610820084031523
8802. we can now prove several	lemmas.	31.224861385798338
8803. in some neighborhood in the f-plane of	any ordinary point of the graph the function f is a single-valued	continuous function.	10.512167909227982
8804. we first show that the function	is	single-valued in some neighborhood.	17.705131344284986
8805. with the vertex at f in the c-plane	we assume that f is the parametric location on c	of an ordinary intersection q between c and f.	8.867580165867308
8806. in	the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are	f.	12.695057997532345
8807. we know that in the c-plane both c and f are analytic.	18.084656672034015
8808. in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian	coordinates u v with the origin at q and	such that both c and f have finite slope at q.	10.630574850518315
8809. near	q both curves can be represented by analytic functions of	u.	9.669550099771405
8810. in a neighborhood of q the difference between these	functions is also a single-valued analytic function of u.	16.163865711183746
8811. furthermore	one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference	function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only	a finite number of extrema in any interval.	8.767721835416303
8812. now to find f one needs	the intersection of c and f near q.	13.612777493343023
8813. but f is just	the curve f translated without rotation through a small arc for	f is always obtained by rotating c through exactly 90`.	8.736484653761185
8814. the	arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.	12.514366305997155
8815. thus if e is	sufficiently	small there can be only one intersection of c and	f near q for if there were more than one intersection for every	e then the difference between c and f near q	would not be a monotone function.	9.59459437213932
8816. therefore f is single-valued	near q.	16.924785458084283
8817. it is also seen that f since the change from f	to f is accomplished by a continuous translation.	13.241539433158469
8818. thus f is also	continuous at f and in a neighborhood of f which does not contain	a tangent point.	12.509800251704476
8819. we turn now to the set of tangent points on	the graph.	12.480752796487398
8820. this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.	13.882468763207669
8821. the fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except	in closed intervals follows from the argument used in lemma 1 namely	that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curves c	and f are analytic and therefore the difference between them	must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the	tangent point.	9.13147829822488
8822. this prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence	of isolated tangent points.	13.69321469918404
8823. in some neighborhood of	an	isolated tangent point in the f-plane say f the function f is	either double-valued or has no values defined except at the tangent	point itself where it is single-valued.	9.705254479514636
8824. a tangent point	q in the c-plane occurs when c and f are	tangent to one another.	11.037575924625296
8825. a continuous change in t through an amount	e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve	f.	8.65154846580987
8826. there are three possibilities: f remains tangent to	c as it is translated; f moves away from c and	does not intersect it at all for f; f cuts across c	and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in f.	11.251622952202705
8827. the	first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points	in the f-plane the end points of which fall into category	or.	8.477143847103745
8828. in the second category the function f has no values defined	in a neighborhood f.	15.526880601407822
8829. in the third category the function is double-valued	in this interval.	16.708743447473132
8830. the same remarks apply to an interval on the	other side of f.	13.92135399863267
8831. again the analyticity of the two curves guarantee	that such intervals exist.	13.123361001456017
8832. in the neighborhood of an end point of an	interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued	or no-valued on one side and is a single-valued function consisting	entirely of tangent points on the other side.	13.00577911754117
8833. with the	above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f.	11.766485658180686
8834. first for any value of t for which all values of f	are ordinary points the number of values of f must be	odd.	10.572630346082928
8835. for it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections	of c and f must be even	and the	center of rotation at t is the argument of the function not a	value.	11.437744111107099
8836. therefore for any value of t the number of values of	f is equal to the number of tangent points corresponding	to the argument t plus an odd number.	11.61344422570314
8837. the	number of ordinary values of the function f at t	will be called its multiplicity at t.	9.420789239842783
8838. the graph	of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval	0t.	14.331682390516606
8839. then every component	of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.	9.81553426369064
8840. suppose f is defined in the sub-interval f.	14.348749620133617
8841. now f and f	must both be tangent points on the nth component in the f-plane;	otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond	these points.	8.11775088148439
8842. further we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of	f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can	only change by an even integer.	9.003358832992651
8843. thus the multiplicity of f for a given	t must be an even number.	11.731242854186027
8844. this is true of all components	which have such a bounded support.	22.841703179806895
8845. but this is a contradiction for we	know that the multiplicity of f is odd for every t.	13.552277422164241
8846. we have shown that the graph of f contains at least one	component whose inverse is the entire interval 0t and	whose multiplicity is odd.	11.41301745109215
8847. there must be an odd number of such components	which will be called complete components.	17.16554171577599
8848. the remaining	components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument	and are defined only on a proper	sub-interval of 0t.	10.333036995126069
8849. we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist	two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the c-plane	are on opposite sides of c.	9.696424426564725
8850. we again consider a	fixed point p at f and a variable point q at f on	c.	11.530052741657313
8851. we erect a square with pq as a side and with free	corners f and f adjacent to p and q respectively.	9.253668880966709
8852. as s varies from zero to t the values of s for	which f and f cross c will be denoted by f and f	respectively.	10.820071805300579
8853. we have f plus tangent points.	21.457993183667057
8854. these s-values	are just the ordinary values of f.	14.252467543607985
8855. the values f	are the ordinary values at f of a multi-valued function g	which has components corresponding to those of f.	9.813452030083852
8856. we first define a function b as follows: given the	set of squares such that each has three corners on c and vertex	at t b is the corresponding set of positive parametric	differences between t and the backward corner points.	8.881312174911308
8857. the functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity	at every argument t.	10.743457387767982
8858. now with p fixed at f f-values	occur when the corner f crosses c and are among the values	of s such that f.	10.557291933763732
8859. the roots of this equation are just the	ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight	line of unit slope through f in the b-plane	.	8.206299312425905
8860. we define these values as f and define g	in the same way for each t.	13.797078313562807
8861. thus we obtain g	by introducing an oblique g-axis in the b-plane.	11.411738841587281
8862. in 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions	in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex	numbers.	12.709185108669075
8863. these are defined by a simple involutorial transformation	of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface	bearing a curve of symbol f.	9.125160787761633
8864. then in 2 we show that any line	involution with the properties that it has no complex of invariant	lines and its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve is necessarily of the	type discussed in 1.	9.391976656007618
8865. no generalization of these results to spaces	of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.	9.811774817155221
8866. let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli f	and f and let \g be a f curve of order k on q.	10.032521224726352
8867. a	general line l meets q in two points f and f through	each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus f whose	lines are simple secants of \g.	7.509320436455853
8868. on these generators let f and	f be respectively the harmonic conjugates of f and f with respect	to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets \g.	10.996015579776676
8869. the line f is the image of l.	19.44426653846204
8870. clearly the transformation	is involutorial.	19.089017696946478
8871. we observe first that no line l	can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q.	9.859991126810325
8872. for if it did the plane of l and l' would contain	two generators of f which is impossible.	14.327899160978397
8873. moreover from the definitive	transformation of intercepts on the generators of f it is clear	that the only points of q at which a line can meets its image	are the points of \g.	7.6249146480643155
8874. hence the totality of singular lines is	the kth order complex of lines which meet \g.	12.13862605956016
8875. the	invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of \g	since each of these meets q in two points which are invariant.	8.897697219729405
8876. the order of this congruence is f since f secants of a curve of	symbol  on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point.	12.077049634953127
8877. the class of the congruence is f since an arbitrary plane meets	\g in k points.	10.18503851372138
8878. since the complex of singular	lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant	lines it follows from the formula f that the order of the involution	is f.	12.041351518718658
8879. there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines	whose images are not unique.	14.282896213324277
8880. the most obvious of these is the quadratic	complex of tangents to q each line of which is transformed	into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image	of the point of tangency of the given line.	10.274824295667472
8881. thus pencils of	tangents to q are transformed into pencils of tangents.	10.738206050654526
8882. it is	interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established between the	lines of two such pencils so that in a sense a unique image can actually	be assigned to each tangent.	12.047071739554859
8883. for the lines of any plane |p	meeting q in a conic c are transformed into the congruence	of secants of the curve c' into which c is	transformed in the point involution on q.	8.408887197821771
8884. in particular tangents	to c are transformed into tangents to c'.	15.634134195230045
8885. moreover	if f and f are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent	to q at a point p the two free intersections of	the image curves f and f must coincide at p' the image	of p and at this point f and f must have a common tangent	l'.	8.0455860797117
8886. hence thought of as a line in a particular plane |p	any tangent to q has a unique image and moreover this image	is the same for all planes through l.	10.199387993136526
8887. each generator	|l of f is also exceptional for each is transformed into the	entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator	is transformed by the point involution on q.	7.523359323151523
8888. this curve is of	symbol f since it meets |l and hence every line of f in the	f invariant points on |l and since it obviously meets every line	of f in a single point.	9.187933851161361
8889. the congruence of its secants is therefore	of order f and class f.	10.61385277229228
8890. a final class of exceptional lines	is identifiable from the following considerations: since no two	generators of f can intersect it follows that their image curves	can have no free intersections.	9.755166078144171
8891. in other words these curves have only	fixed intersections common to them all.	15.407076081424272
8892. now the only way in which all	curves of the image family of f can pass through a fixed point is	to have a generator of f which is not a secant but a tangent of \g	for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into	the point of tangency.	10.15349484790435
8893. since two curves of symbol f on q intersect	in f points it follows that there are f lines of f which	are tangent to \g.	9.507957275461182
8894. clearly any line l of any bundle	having one of these points of tangency t as vertex will be transformed	into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection	of l and q as vertex and lying in the plane determined	by the image point and the generator of f which is tangent to	\g at t.	8.871482556778693
8895. a line through two of these points f and f	will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the	tangents to \g at f and f as directrices.	8.555222876086273
8896. a conic c	being a curve on q meets the image of any line	of f which we have already found to be a f curve on q	in f points.	12.084439629206583
8897. hence its image c' meets any line of f	in f points.	11.420317517715086
8898. moreover c' obviously meets any line f in	a single point.	13.494618434486073
8899. hence c' is a f curve on q.	12.572103150466909
8900. therefore	the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general	plane field of lines is of order f and class f.	11.923932183864478
8901. finally the image	of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order	of the congruence of invariant lines namely f and whose class is	the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines	namely f.	7.483492287487215
8902. the preceding observations make it clear that there	exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex	of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve \g.	9.507383746644805
8903. we now shall	show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily	of the type we have just described.	11.145460668215573
8904. to do this we must first	show that every line which meets \g in a point p meets its	image at p.	11.700142667190821
8905. to see this consider a general pencil of lines	containing a general secant of \g.	10.875439125584363
8906. by the image of this pencil	is a ruled surface of order f which is met by the plane of the	pencil in a curve c of order f.	11.990430680506572
8907. on c there is a	f correspondence in which the f points cut from c by a general	line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection	of the image of l and the plane of the pencil.	10.841566211640357
8908. since c	is rational this correspondence has k coincidences each	of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image.	10.54157455049089
8909. however	since the pencil contains a secant of \g it actually contains only	f singular lines.	8.62963042412541
8910. to avoid this contradiction it is necessary that	c be composite with the secant of \g and a curve of	order f as components.	10.965898871229113
8911. thus it follows that the secants of \g	are all invariant.	12.836612691557532
8912. but if this is the case then an arbitrary pencil	of lines having a point p of \g as vertex is transformed	into a ruled surface of order f having f generators concurrent at	p.	12.015635644748489
8913. since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent	generators	is necessarily a cone it follows finally that every line through	a point p of \g meets its image at p as asserted.	7.704311561074203
8914. now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle	with vertex p on \g which is effected by the involution	as a whole.	10.47028247585568
8915. from the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle	is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.	12.981541612474912
8916. moreover	in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order f namely	the cone of secants of \g which pass through p.	9.475002119459479
8917. hence	it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective	de jonquieres involution of order f and the invariant locus must	have a multiple line of multiplicity either f or f.	7.460351384888465
8918. the first possibility	requires that there be a line through p which meets	\g in f points; the second requires that there be a line through	p which meets \g in f points.	10.161888976613373
8919. in each case lines	of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they	determine with the multiple secant.	11.575125082109379
8920. in the first case the fixed elements	within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the	vertex p to the intersection of \g and the plane of	the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant.	10.189412009043012
8921. in the second	the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex p to	the two intersections of \g and the plane of the pencil which do	not lie on the multiple secant.	9.295755755151232
8922. the multiple secants of course are	exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order f.	12.131388124750123
8923. observations similar to these can be made at each point of \g.	11.711663424147009
8924. hence \g must have either a regulus of f-fold secants or	a regulus of f-fold secants.	11.082087063393221
8925. moreover if f no two of the multiple	secants can intersect.	13.414475341914809
8926. for if such were the case either the plane	of the two lines would meet \g in more than k points or	alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined	by the two lines would be too high.	10.950620040385196
8927. but if no two lines of the regulus	of multiple secants of \g can intersect then the regulus must	be quadratic or in other words \g must be either a f or a f	curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.	9.199896746855973
8928. we now observe that	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric is impossible if	the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which	meet \g.	10.350559227857984
8929. for any pencil in a plane containing a f-fold secant	of \g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil	in f lines namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass	through the intersection of \g and the multiple secant plus an additional	component to account for the intersections of the images of	the general lines of the pencil.	8.213668475752293
8930. however if there is no additional complex	of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is	precisely f.	17.11040098569054
8931. this contradicts the preceding observations and so	under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that	\g is a f curve on a quadric surface.	8.08803777679042
8932. continuing with	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric q we first	observe that the second regulus of q consists precisely of	the lines which join the two free intersections of \g and the planes	through any one of the multiple secants.	9.16684547789765
8933. for each of these lines	meets q in three points namely two points on \g and one	point on one of the multiple secants.	11.592145195873218
8934. now consider an arbitrary	line l meeting q in two points f and f.	11.838536535551041
8935. if	|a is the multiple secant of \g which passes through f and	|b is the simple secant of \g which passes through f and	if f are the points in which |a meets \g and if f is the	image of f on the generator |b it follows that the image of	the line f is f.	6.792010974431177
8936. these societies can expect to face difficult times.	15.449568336944408
8937. as the historic	processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion	will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and	subjects town and country will widen; new aspirants for power will	emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may	lose their nerve and their sense of direction.	7.473249568403303
8938. national leaders will	have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people	through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's	sense of identity.	9.147504139215984
8939. feelings of a community of interest will have to	be recreated- in some of the new nations indeed they must be built	for the first time- on a new basis which looks toward the future and	does not rely only on shared memories of the past.	8.893726963600031
8940. nevertheless with	foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous	consequences of social change which have troubled other countries	passing through this stage can be escaped.	10.321870673263046
8941. the united states can	help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries	face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms	of assistance where possible.	9.142187458036858
8942. our central goal should be	to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle	boldly the tasks which they face.	9.620204244923709
8943. at the same time we should recognize	that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability	which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone	to diversions and external adventures of all sorts.	11.102318886750291
8944. it may seem to some	of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing	in the	murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable	tasks at home.	11.95900830963554
8945. we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion	both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting	firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene.	11.241774436896891
8946. when necessary	we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal	advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for	disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but	also risk their own prospects for orderly development.	10.930606344589604
8947. as a nation	we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development;	but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly	seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world	community.	8.944710792556306
8948. when we look at countries like	iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress has been	made	in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital	and where institutions of centralized government exist we find	a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence	different priorities for policy.	8.997716337567782
8949. the men in power are committed	in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding	only erratically.	12.36766692780434
8950. isolated enterprises have been launched but	they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern.	13.303824577764606
8951. the	society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban	sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications	between the two.	8.760249384635138
8952. progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions	to effective action among those in power and by a failure on	their part to understand how local resources human and material can	be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically	accepted.	9.052977674415688
8953. most countries in this second category share	the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political	and social system without the modern standards of performance required	to make them effective.	8.604127752116906
8954. in these rapidly changing societies there	is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals.	15.934261490695825
8955. the colonial period has generally left people believing that government	can if it wishes provide all manner of services for them-	and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the	benefits of modern life.	9.048314287978146
8956. for example in accordance with the fashion	of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development	plans of varying numbers of years; such is the mystique of	planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow	automatically upon its announcement.	11.019265091330501
8957. the civil services in such societies	are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing	them; and their members often equate a government career with security	and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence.	7.758127174790421
8958. american policy should press constantly the view that	until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their	bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize	of democratize their societies.	10.548539900724919
8959. we should spread the view that	planning and national development are serious matters which call for	effort as well as enthusiasm.	11.433069494091411
8960. above all we should seek to encourage	the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they	are responsible for their fates.	11.349128230978051
8961. only within the framework of a mature	relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can	we provide telling assistance.	9.158574738800047
8962. with respect to those countries whose	leaders prefer to live with their illusions we can afford to wait	for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all	to see.	10.511635816422304
8963. our technical assistance to these countries should	place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the	role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts	assumed in dealing with the central governments.	7.781741025081757
8964. we should encourage	the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities	state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller	groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is	neglected.	10.689667379193526
8965. simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships	of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural	training can be introduced into education how health affects labor	productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community	and above all how progress in each field relates to national progress.	7.348164891808405
8966. efforts such as the community development program in the philippines	have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward	balanced national development.	10.47762906816929
8967. to achieve this goal of balanced development	communications between the central government and the local communities	must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves	are effectively taken into account.	10.10790040446089
8968. if modernization programs	are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of	the people they will encounter grave difficulties.	11.333672371588811
8969. land reform	is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries.	14.78797148854429
8970. it should	be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform	programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic	growth and modernization of the society.	11.724699286245439
8971. as an isolated policy	land reform is likely to be politically disruptive; as part of a larger	development effort however it may gain wide acceptance.	13.925721270492984
8972. it should	also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved	by administrative decrees alone.	14.547368118552296
8973. land reform programs need to be	supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance	in agriculture.	8.472754868807357
8974. lastly governmental and private planners	will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming	ahead.	10.47426405520093
8975. by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the	united states can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted	economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth.	7.944316282049129
8976. modernizing societies	at a third stage in the modernization	process are such countries as india brazil the philippines and	taiwan which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining	growth.	9.480323567148414
8977. they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs;	and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity	around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing	participation in the program to wider and wider groups.	8.24734757424311
8978. but these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary	human and social overhead capital; they have established reasonably	stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local	levels; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically	and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies.	9.67945591628905
8979. on the economic front the first priority of these countries	is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources.	10.589098472595726
8980. several related	tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved.	16.114387136033166
8981. these countries must formulate a comprehensive long-term program	covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors	of the economy.	9.47356919393816
8982. they must in their planning be able to count on at least	tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods	of several years.	12.21422903716303
8983. capital imports drawn from a number of sources must	be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment	programming to go forward.	8.713490403690306
8984. capital flows must be coordinated with	national needs and planning.	11.793662721363662
8985. finally a balance must be effected among	project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general	balance of payments support.	8.759255198612351
8986. thus although the agenda of external	assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the	policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant	the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages	of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining	growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.	9.543634935624938
8987. there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved.	14.989687439183681
8988. for one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained	bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects; even the	famed indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous	range of tasks it has undertaken.	10.439514226527882
8989. technical assistance in training middle-	and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases.	8.726964567637841
8990. there are also more basic problems.	35.58028424908514
8991. this is the stage at which democratic	developments must take place if the society is to become an	open community of creative people.	11.01664800681148
8992. nevertheless impulses still exist	among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need	for centralized and authoritarian practices.	10.006888306575165
8993. another great danger is	that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated	from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference	to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism.	7.591667590772403
8994. the capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional	classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to	be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their	own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts	in the west.	10.262839545111389
8995. particularly when based upon a single dominant party	governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of	understanding about the national interest.	7.556878632736834
8996. convinced of the wisdom of	their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development	programs governments may fail to push outward to win more	and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and	inflexible in their policies.	8.645905862051606
8997. american policy toward such societies	should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional	classes.	10.281842291774474
8998. it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation	of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers	and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies.	13.716919973063039
8999. we	have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic	and free countries; we also have in consequence the duty to appraise	realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate	our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways.	7.196161917842458
9000. factor	we have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society	will take a considerable period of time.	10.905518698788525
9001. with the exception of	treaty-making foreign relations were historically concerned for the	most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration.	13.206296972192767
9002. foreign	policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled	not merely at response but also at projection.	10.800435685468488
9003. american and free-world	policies can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically	that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in	the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which	each society must generate.	7.886519857715267
9004. it follows that any effective policy toward	the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working	horizon.	17.647989788425136
9005. it must be marked by a patience and persistence which have	not always been its trademark.	13.663305709475557
9006. this condition affects not only	the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign	policy especially in the context of economic aid.	13.750433603150062
9007. the place of	religion in the simple preliterate societies is quite definite; as	a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly	in every part of it.	9.447783216358545
9008. in societies like ours however its place	is less clear and more complex.	13.53780763738168
9009. with the diversity of religious viewpoints	there are differences of opinion as to the essential features	of religion; and there are different opinions as to the essential	functions of religion.	11.60548293731734
9010. nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous	advanced societies though less for the less religious portion	religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions.	12.678631624324998
9011. although the inner functions of religion are not of direct	significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences.	9.647570552361753
9012. if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual	is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate;	he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic; he is	better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows.	10.362160639322077
9013. there are	several closely related inner functions.	21.172177923638007
9014. in the last analysis	religion is the means of inducing formulating expressing enhancing	implementing and perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious.	13.225886675396751
9015. man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow.	17.61946377384522
9016. religion	seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence.	12.3482207866056
9017. the significant	things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional	mental and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs	of self-preservation self-pacification and self-completion.	8.580098264387948
9018. the chief	experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions	of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power.	11.394253321190005
9019. related to	this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual	his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively	secure in an ordered dependable universe.	11.696189179353851
9020. man has the experience	of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand;	he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and	movement.	11.810152884733615
9021. the universe is a safe and permanent home.	15.784153697839688
9022. a number	of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the	ultimate and eternal.	12.218733679259598
9023. death is not permanent defeat and disappearance;	man has a second chance.	11.384068025515946
9024. he is not lost in the abyss of endless	time; he has endless being.	20.61064381137331
9025. religion at its best also offers the	experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm	of the spirit.	8.405645216438408
9026. religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve	all the highest ideals and values- ethical aesthetic and religious-	of man formed in his culture.	9.051154372622117
9027. there is also the possibility	among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life	and enjoying guidance and expansiveness.	15.1269689658549
9028. the kind of religious experience	that most moderns seek not only provides clarifies and relates	human yearnings values ideals and purposes; it also provides facilities	and incitements for the development of personality sociality	and creativeness.	10.169762400806244
9029. under the religious impulse whether theistic or	humanistic men have joy in living; life leads somewhere.	10.896910359684684
9030. religion	at its best is out in front ever beckoning and leading on and as lippman	put it mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant	sense of his own infinite importance.	9.144558264994204
9031. at the same	time	that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and	gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has	great therapeutic value for him.	9.362630348965183
9032. it gives him aid comfort even solace	in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical	knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate.	11.63511427696448
9033. he is confronted	with the recurrent crises such as great natural catastrophes and	the great transitions of life- marriage incurable disease widowhood	old age the certainty of death.	9.510169502066267
9034. he has to cope with frustration	and other emotional disturbance and anomie.	22.543335944768522
9035. his religious beliefs provide	him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause	him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity	and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune	fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger.	7.215908272893951
9036. religion	usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised	perfect future state.	10.358652090748608
9037. the belief in immortality where held	functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here	and now.	8.998955821926716
9038. the tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing	or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less	self-contained or self-sufficient by confession repentance and penance.	9.488339800308188
9039. the feeling of individual inferiority defeat or humilation growing	out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures	is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly	but all-victorious father-god as well as by sympathetic fellowship	with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious	acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.	7.542158348968104
9040. in providing	for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf	of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is	no other institution.	10.987427341964558
9041. in addition to the functions of religion	within man there have always been the outer social functions for the	community and society.	14.10750374527126
9042. the two have never been separable.	21.89287937091106
9043. religion	is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation.	10.057988591011652
9044. the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with	and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious	beliefs and convictions.	10.650382458653123
9045. the religion supports re-enforces	reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values.	12.204673387645432
9046. even in the united	states with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast	denominational differentiation there is a general consensus regarding	the basic christian values.	13.460008568625339
9047. this is demonstrated especially when there	is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere;	for example americans rally to christian values vis-a-vis those	of atheistic communism.	9.760000468269912
9048. in america also all of our major religious bodies	officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of	our common religion.	12.035065422015071
9049. even the non-church members- the freewheelers	marginal religionists and so on- have the values of christian civilization	internalized in them.	10.48546760101105
9050. furthermore religion tends to integrate	the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god	to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example those regarding	material objects and pragmatic ends.	9.183477175913449
9051. finally it gives sanctity	more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference	transcendent and supernatural importance to some values; for example	marriage as a sacrament much law-breaking as sinful occasionally	the state as a divine instrument.	7.449821281945407
9052. it places certain values at least	beyond questioning and tampering.	19.40066817116588
9053. closely related to this	function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate	ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal	ends.	10.50668077486541
9054. this something leads to a conception of an over-all social	plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends; for example	a plan that fulfills the will of god which advances the kingdom	of god which involves social life as part of the grand design.	0.0
9055. this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their	primacy.	11.884170268561359
9056. it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs	of social action.	15.880815580962464
9057. finally it gives meaning to much social endeavor	and logic consistency and meaning to life.	9.712030398608718
9058. in general there is no	society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired	transcendental ends.	14.621560702611905
9059. some	of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings	have grown out of religion.	8.894924021240305
9060. these groups have varied widely from	mere families primitive totemic groups and small modern cults and	sects to the memberships of great denominations and great widely	dispersed world religions.	9.13827729073226
9061. religion fosters group life in various ways.	11.118618003375188
9062. the common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are	a most important factor.	12.398097595094617
9063. without a system of values there can be no	society.	14.522480716496283
9064. where such a value system prevails it always unifies all	who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system.	10.469697574579811
9065. the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed	in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what durkheim calls a credo.	8.409778452916047
9066. as he points out a religious group cannot exist without a collective	credo and the more extensive the credo the more unified and strong	is the group.	11.35764992683619
9067. the credo unifies and socializes men by attaching	them completely to an identical body of doctrine; the more extensive	and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group.	8.39531409767571
9068. the religious	symbolism and especially the closely related rites and worship	forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith.	12.95310413382938
9069. the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group	small or large.	13.08498489921746
9070. the common codes for religious action as such and	in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees	together.	10.878724468958046
9071. these are ways of jointly participating in significantly	symbolized standardized and ordered religiously sanctified behavior.	10.414002138823548
9072. the codes are mechanism for training in and directing and enforcing	uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reasserting	the solidarity of the group.	9.811657476413778
9073. durkheim noted long ago that	religion as h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative	to sacred things h unites into one single moral community h	all	those who adhere to them.	7.509709616657798
9074. his view is that every religion pertains	to	a community and conversely every community is in one aspect a religious	unit.	10.79739723607746
9075. this is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails	even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular	semi-public and public occasions in the united states; and it is	evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions	and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds.	9.49556401794118
9076. the	unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically	peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural	units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed	and not politically organized.	9.915266253950513
9077. the jews for 2500 years have been	a prime example though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion	are cases in point.	8.71141883158639
9078. it might be pointed out that the integrating	function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been	identified with other groupings- political nationality language class	racial sociability even economic.	12.582282499282563
9079. religion usually exercises	a stabilizing-conserving function.	12.851133807717682
9080. as such it acts as an anchor	for the people.	18.69962446119617
9081. there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly	established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies	and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance.	12.429008092672984
9082. it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of	social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation	or diffusion of new ones.	12.189578480877186
9083. it tends to support the longstanding precious	sentiments the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways	of living.	11.9351477972794
9084. as yinger has pointed out the h reliance on symbols	on tradition on sacred writings on the cultivation of emotional	feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the	past far more than to the future.	10.138724993827882
9085. historically religion has also	functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction	and perpetuation of various other institutions.	8.494416513163191
9086. at the same	time that religion exercises a conserving influence it also energizes	and motivates both individuals and groups.	13.367424089243995
9087. much of the important	individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives.	15.12850425959685
9088. the	great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon	lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force	mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices; for example the crusades	mission efforts just wars.	9.787849804395826
9089. much effort has been expended in the	sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion.	10.652973882976976
9090. the	insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating	effects.	11.33819267263277
9091. religion provides the most attractive rewards either	in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms	but who engage in good works.	8.082664187204475
9092. religion usually acts as a	powerful	aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not	do.	9.908939338115298
9093. among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were	more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group;	and in modern societies such influence is still great.	9.265654033112737
9094. religion has	its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes	of behavior for the here and now.	13.103545450005862
9095. overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about	persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income	her defense of denial was excessively strong.	7.698169680502066
9096. thus the lack of effective	recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two	babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem.	12.934625077922593
9097. the result dramatically	visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily	functioning was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall	the second twin whose birth had not been anticipated.	10.044713776663604
9098. soon mrs	b's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning	the welfare of the entire family.	12.563712713630323
9099. inability to care for the other	children difficulty in feeding the babies who seemed colicky bone-weary	fatigue repeated crying episodes and short tempers reflected	the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation.	8.225822160116802
9100. clearly	this was a family in crisis.	13.915190642667962
9101. mrs b compared her	feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at	the time of her mother's death when she was eight as well as her subsequent	anger at her father for remarrying.	8.40080024973105
9102. her previous traumatic experiences	flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday.	15.192329465523091
9103. on the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized	tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral.	9.812607891408286
9104. in the family's own words they	had reached the crisis peak- either the situation will give or	we	will break!   direct confrontation and acceptance of mrs	b's anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears	of annihilation.	9.770894473791019
9105. abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the	death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger	and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further	relief of tension.	7.2432604825631115
9106. in a joint interview mr and mrs b were	helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away	from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the	arrival of the twins.	11.882777597359643
9107. the father accurately perceiving the child's	needs not only respected them as worthy of his attention but immediately	satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins	saying i have a big lap; there is room for you too johnnie.	8.14166108400771
9108. simultaneously a variety of environmental supports- a calm but	not	too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent	use of nursing care accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical	advice on the twins' feeding problem- combined to prevent further	development of predictable pathological mechanisms.	8.380966814518153
9109. follow-up visits	of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the	care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's	day-to-day mental health and social functioning.	8.817192310625158
9110. as seen	in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop	conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a	formal request for assistance.	15.572717794035398
9111. the lack of awareness usually springs	from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the superficial guise	of not knowing or not caring.	9.692084519278957
9112. the unhealthy use of denial	in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium	of a positive controlled transference.	10.350024345083284
9113. in general the approach is	more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective.	13.085041575175644
9114. while some	regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged	so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression	associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic	model for insight therapy.	8.736161990676484
9115. to establish an emotionally meaningful	relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness	immediately preferably within the first interview by meeting	the client's specific needs.	8.690772516102133
9116. these needs usually concern the reduction	of guilt and some relief of tension.	11.843025755845446
9117. the initial interview must	be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking	sense.	10.61385277229228
9118. in this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate	confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem.	15.374838435639251
9119. in	so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind	of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness	generally associated with the first stages of stress impact.	8.101868174709331
9120. thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive	efforts on his own behalf.	13.76441556177367
9121. here there is a specific preventive component	which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation.	11.341565190572911
9122. we are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue	regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of	denial and crippling guilt turned against the self.	10.5826250673268
9123. while some suppression	and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the worker's	clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used	what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated and when	efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed.	7.288251191107077
9124. in steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive	responses the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques	of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance.	10.07506465980604
9125. over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve	weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth	between immediate external stressful exigencies	and the key emotionally relevant issues	which are often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivated	by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution.	7.952746884943859
9126. though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they	do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the	spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments.	11.95907827629005
9127. then too the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously	combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits single and group	office interviews and appropriate telephone follow-up calls if	the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy	outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles	of preventive intervention.	8.317118394358088
9128. in addition in many cases a variety of	concrete social resources- homemaker day care medical and financial	aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to	bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative	efforts.	9.944796742815484
9129. at certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic	reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use	of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive	rather than defeating.	8.828372258337717
9130. while expensive in time and involving	a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker	willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into	techniques of accompaniment were found to be of	tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives.	11.698883821383387
9131. finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all	preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the	stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family	members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.	8.913496002779947
9132. having outlined	an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we	now address ourselves to our final question: what place should brief	crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of	services?	9.210901564319318
9133.  we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy	of values locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term	intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part	of a continuum each important in its own right.	9.563008974481841
9134. this problem is perhaps	as old as social casework itself.	15.727101440078826
9135. almost three decades ago bertha	reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of	her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected	place in our network of social services.	7.986934278900336
9136. her conclusion has been borne	out in the experience of many practitioners: h short-contact	interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but	is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work.	9.86608385139216
9137. thus	casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be	regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the	quantity of time expended.	10.826763344576987
9138. that we are experiencing an upsurge	of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of	brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling	of current literature.	10.607874102420052
9139. especially noteworthy is levinger's finding	that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of	successful outcome.	10.856266052017604
9140. according to a number of studies the important	predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as	well as the accessibility of the helping person.	12.751987895999894
9141. for example the level	of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of	immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably	with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where	the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the	number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental	project.	8.022768430421282
9142. of startling significance too is the assertion that	it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition	rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable	group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated	child guidance services.	9.808444664566608
9143. these reports refer to a level of secondary	prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route	of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people.	8.492894757012527
9144. similarities to the approach which i have described are evident in	the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick appraisal of	key issues and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the	essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in	dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses.	9.138558695232618
9145. while there	are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention	the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings	all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's	initial need for help.	8.76249365655465
9146. in some programs treatment is concentrated	over a short period of time while in others after the initial	contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally	used with apparent success.	10.879487309899762
9147. willingness to take the risk of	early and direct interpretation	is another prominent	feature in these efforts.	10.118437775597243
9148. my aim in mentioning this factor obviously	is not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage	us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess	and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional	pride.	9.323900491665587
9149. though there is obviously great need for continued	experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further	efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at	the secondary- or perhaps in some instances primary- level the	place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number	of investigators in a wide variety of settings.	8.511170690785843
9150. woodward for example	has emphasized the need for a broad spectrum of services including	very brief services in connection with critical situations.	11.647833421255788
9151. ideally	brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice	rather	than as a treatment of chance.	8.887922756128061
9152. moreover the shortage of treatment	resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower	force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention	techniques to make services more widely available- and on a	more effective basis to more people.	9.22226399457458
9153. further research in the meaning	of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework	services- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures	crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment	approaches- and the establishment of new experimental programs are	imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers	in collaboration with community planners.	7.391553596889356
9154. our literature	is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive	agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the	globally utopian.	10.20335124043419
9155. probably in the immediate future we will have to	settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models.	9.80437300182081
9156. increased	experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those	that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare	services holds rich promise for the future.	8.951887347307554
9157. for example child welfare	experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for	substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully	linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships.	9.156664289115716
9158. tension management and communication of sentiment	are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment	or feeling.	10.815199236962036
9159. one of the devices for tension management is preferential	mating.	22.345643792264564
9160. the preferential mating of this particular population	has been analyzed in a separate study.	12.320167440178693
9161. the relative geographical isolation	of the brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating.	10.422250059543702
9162. it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support	for one another since it is not provided by the larger society.	18.696950215436107
9163. the	supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and	social isolation.	9.669550099771405
9164. the newlyweds building homes on the same land with	either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the	population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive	relationship.	10.677069367312004
9165. as loomis remarks in the internal pattern	the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking friendship	and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another	and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic	relations.	8.21861192148122
9166. maintenance of the status	quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population	today.	13.643895861458748
9167. yet the object of the element of achieving through the	process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed	by circumstances brought about by the war.	9.61556279792115
9168. prior to world war	2 there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after	world war 2.	12.709496620958976
9169. the norms as elements refer	to all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual	and group actions in any social system.	8.409778452916047
9170. the process of evaluation	assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements.	14.421792010643
9171. the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate	selection in this population.	11.767445539132204
9172. from the evidence it may be conjectured	that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and	females; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of	permissive unions; and core-negro marriages are proscribed for core	members.	9.938469871787508
9173. the element of status-roles and associated	processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population	to permit any type of conjectures about them.	9.584694583536761
9174. there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members	of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary	influence of non-authoritative power has been exerted on actors in	the system particularly in regard to mate selection.	11.669831248004478
9175. this would seem	to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal	status of that family.	10.252194374613142
9176. again size of the group may have	some influence on the strength of group controls.	18.76857518176566
9177. interviews	with members of the brandywine population were attempted in	order	to discover the ranking of the various families in the population.	9.160227768720173
9178. the large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the	upper positions.	15.31332034059987
9179. loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation	process.	13.630410111617339
9180. the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system	is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in	accordance with the norms and standards of the system.	10.319507256484593
9181. despite the	increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able	to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate	status in society.	8.79668297991772
9182. to some extent the system can be considered	a gemeinschaft in which social-role occupancies are determined	by birth by attributes such as sex or caste which are biologically	or socially immutable.	10.216599159689316
9183. the adherence of many in the population to	the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact	that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest	in	determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate	status of the group in society.	7.9876450150932685
9184. the negative	sanctions applied to core-negro marriages for core members act as	indicators of expected adherence to group norms.	10.775365892393362
9185. however because of	church laws lately more stringently enforced which forbid the marriage	of cousins closely related consanguineously a means of facilitating	the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate	unions.	8.511463113945243
9186. a cursory survey of available material indicates a high	rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous	relationship.	9.976524862873173
9187. the comprehensive or master	processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system	and subsystems.	11.030176500946459
9188. within the larger social system are the structural	and functional subsystems.	16.086758854579596
9189. the structural subsystem consisting of	relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts includes:	subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms.	9.236244641042658
9190. roles of various types within the larger system and within	the subgroups h  regulative norms governing subgroups and	roles.	10.103862840424782
9191. in the study of marriage	patterns for this group consanguinity produces the structural system-	a system of affinities- which in turn maintains the system of	consanguinity.	11.518206254924257
9192. subgroups of various types have been found within this	system.	14.239671997159896
9193. each family line can be considered a substructure.	14.668100315210898
9194. there seems	to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status	within the group.	19.850100455552827
9195. additionally the proscription of core-negro marriages	for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative	norm governing subgroups and roles.	9.278744690918295
9196. the scope of this study does	not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger	system or within the subgroups.	13.125585077212627
9197. however it cannot be presumed informal	though the structure of the population seems that there are not	well-defined roles within the system.	14.595910130877016
9198. the present study relates	to the theory of functional systems.	18.43677233143146
9199. it is hypothesized that fertility	is a function of the social system when the population as a whole	is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division	of core families and marginal families is considered.	9.53520925679267
9200. the four	functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by	the subsystems within this population.	11.584120616025642
9201. by means of geographical isolation	and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern	of isolation from the greater society maintained.	9.379712341563469
9202. in order to attain	the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility	rate provides more group members for mate selection and the clustering	of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls.	10.075451179467247
9203. to	maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not	only necessary that members of this population be visible but	that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct	grouping or system in society.	8.188610975965869
9204. as mentioned above where families	are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and	most effective.	12.12381923831877
9205. adaptation to the social and non-social environment	through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational	segregation.	8.818358823163168
9206. this provides the necessary contact with the larger	society while supporting a type of control over members in terms	of social contacts.	11.14805374321521
9207. integration has to do with the inter-relation	of parts.	17.833743715209447
9208. the problem of solidarity and morale again involves	the concept of values.	17.486730813061445
9209. the values placed by the brandywine population	upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial	identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important	for the morale of the system.	7.945076840783853
9210. since morale is closely related to	pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity	the better the system can solve the problems of the system.	11.006825859871588
9211. in this	respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between	the brandywine population and the white and negro populations within	the same general locality the greater the possibility for higher morale	and solidarity within the brandywine population.	9.646425953405497
9212. it is conceived	that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical	and social isolation.	19.62576212337979
9213. in turn higher fertility rates for this population	provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the	population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity.	10.556092137319409
9214. the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger.	13.569310574206803
9215. of particular utility in the analysis of the	development persistence and change of social systems has been the	use of the master or comprehensive processes.	8.783315624827397
9216. loomis considers six such	processes in his paradigm.	13.037321475654965
9217. boundary	maintenance   3.	19.137741945722095
9218. social control   6.	22.500751025719985
9219. institutionalization though undoubtedly	all six processes are operative within the whole social system	and its subsystems two processes that are of crucial importance to	this study will be singled out for particular emphasis:	in discussing the process of communication loomis defines	it as the process by which information decisions and directives	are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions	and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction.	7.358065088440324
9220. communication	may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger	community.	14.558192333169924
9221. intense interaction is easier where segregated living and	occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community	as in the case of this population.	11.381695672607453
9222. however the factor of physical	isolation is not a static situation.	18.374040935729948
9223. although the brandywine population	is still predominantly rural there are indications of a consistent	and a statistically significant trend away from the older and	relatively isolated rural communities h urbanization appears to be	an important factor in the disintegration of this group.	8.323373776788728
9224. this conclusion	is however an over-simplification.	20.64657046199369
9225. a more realistic analysis must	take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe	area are in general less segregated locally than group members	in rural areas.	9.881643416235503
9226. in the urban area in other words they unlike some	urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto colonies.	14.220542344933268
9227. group pressures	toward conformity are slight or non-existent and deviant behavior	in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions.	8.52167051284616
9228. in such a setting	social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous	resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection	behavior.	14.739073094432898
9229. to the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown	of the group patterns of residential isolation to that extent it	contributes directly to increased exogamy.	9.688181756700729
9230. the process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play	a part in the individual's behavior as well as the group's behavior.	13.315480181622547
9231. by means of this social control deviance is either eliminated	or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group.	11.046561457054771
9232. examples	from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned	by ostracism from the group.	11.483469961322152
9233. there is an oral	tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin	and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society.	20.866292785277867
9234. confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important	part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a	means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community.	12.458068329945787
9235. the fact of indian ancestry and free status during the days	of slavery are important distinctions made by members of the group.	11.998087828925962
9236. culturally induced social cohesion resulting	from common norms and values internalized by members of the group	is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well	as in the process of socialization.	12.186296438806385
9237. the process of boundary maintenance	identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic	interaction is maintained.	10.656796428217366
9238. as the threat of encroachment	on the system increases the probability of applied boundary maintenance	mechanisms increases.	16.053492658922497
9239. the fertility rate pattern would	seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining	the boundary.	12.119757425342279
9240. increased boundary maintenance may be achieved	for example by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities	characteristic of the external pattern h the external pattern	or external system can be considered as group behavior that enables	the group to survive in its environment h boundary maintenance	for	this group would seem to be primarily social as is the preference	for endogamy.	8.756484892332207
9241. it is also expressed in the proscription against deviants	in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas.	16.17378748955377
9242. by their	pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core families and the marginal families	show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain.	9.797522364015036
9243. where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries	or limits of the group systemic linkage is defined as the	process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems	is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways	and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit.	10.950043548203713
9244. a royal decree issued in 1910 two years after the belgian government	assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed	the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms.	10.332690859061783
9245. further decrees	along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919.	10.72493482559549
9246. in 1922 a continuous	registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance	of the governor-general and the periodic compilation of these	records was ordered.	10.740530933433707
9247. but specific procedures for carrying out this	plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors.	10.567861964597986
9248. a unified	set of regulations applicable to all areas was issued in 1929 and	a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was	instituted at the same time.	10.855689825462537
9249. the whole system was again reviewed and	reorganized in 1933.	13.866925755060299
9250. general responsibility for its administration rested	with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor	supply and native affairs service des affaires indigenes et de la	main-d'oeuvre	.	9.77133453375041
9251. tribal authorities the chiefs and their	secretaries were held responsible for maintaining the registers of	indigenous persons within their territories under the general supervision	of district officials.	7.772374523995852
9252. the district officials along with their	other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in	selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic	statistics.	9.846172816333349
9253. the regulations require the inscription of each	individual.	13.974661317959146
9254. the cards filed by circonscription	are kept in the headquarters of each territoire.	15.665717663949296
9255. each	card is expected to show certain information about the individual	concerned including his or her date of birth	spouses and children.	9.635318078635986
9256. additional entries must be made from time	to time.	14.89397896598456
9257. different cards are used for males and females and a corner	is clipped from the cards of adults and of children when they reach	puberty.	8.075846725762489
9258. so a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate	clerk of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes.	13.713269466312918
9259. personal identification cards are issued to all adult males	on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes	of residence are recorded.	7.719095379114949
9260. similar identification cards were issued	in 1959 to all adult females.	12.192656332165114
9261. each adult is held personally responsible	for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card	which must be shown on demand.	8.523769412528218
9262. the registration card of a person leaving	his home territory for a short period is put into a special file	for absent persons.	10.994222233062406
9263. the cards of permanent out-migrants are in theory	sent to an office in the place of new residence.	11.049999308660382
9264. finally the registration	of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory	in most regions.	11.002940970754755
9265. numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes were counted each year.	9.345058977386529
9266. in addition demographic inquiries	supposedly involving field investigations were conducted in selected	minor divisions containing about 3 percent	of the total population.	12.487859662792332
9267. the results of these inquiries were used to	adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various	ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general	fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives	separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households infant mortality	and migration.	7.871730312665756
9268. the areas to be examined in these inquiries were	selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger	population.	11.1198706945904
9269. averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas	were applied to the larger population.	10.244241205024483
9270. the scheme in theory	is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions	of african life.	11.026675696446196
9271. but it places a severe strain on the administrative	resources of a widely dispersed	poor and largely illiterate population.	11.781679873373612
9272. the sampling program was	instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely	recognized in population studies.	12.440989852398367
9273. the system was not well adapted to	conditions of life in urban centers.	15.03160860861173
9274. the distinction between domiciled	and present population was not clearly	defined.	15.226208982765426
9275. so the results are subject to considerable confusion.	14.959622936561148
9276. the	system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated; it	had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951.	10.379484548366504
9277. in spite of the	defects in this system the figures on total population during the late	1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual	conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity.	10.014000994033019
9278. but the	information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.	14.226867914495054
9279. the same system with minor modifications was developed in ruanda-urundi	under belgian administration.	11.872547400905466
9280. here again it seems that	useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the	population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war	periods.	15.761438418311386
9281. before considering more recent activities we	should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa.	9.615166384030221
9282. a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases	with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social	educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo	and ruanda-urundi.	11.177609730863582
9283. the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour l'assistance	medicale aux indigenes du congo belge	has special interest with respect to demography.	11.968010798777119
9284. this agency accepted	responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from	638560 persons in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the kwango district	and adjacent areas east of leopoldville.	9.382309625534933
9285. each year from 1941 on its	medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine	changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary	objective the incidence of major diseases.	8.130632476796618
9286. its findings are reported	each year in its rapport sur l'activite pendant annee h.	11.07093722802264
9287. somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical	officers in other areas.	12.23407023205277
9288. other independent or partially independent	agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly	related to demography.	10.56782412580819
9289. these studies vary widely in scope and precision.	12.154930943353088
9290. l'institut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale	has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has	cooperated closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development	of its official statistics.	9.036237106687906
9291. a massive investigation	of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in	ruanda-urundi is being carried on by j j maquet former director	of the social science branch of irsac now a professor	at l'universite officielle du congo belge et du ruanda-urundi.	7.216997162426844
9292. some 30000 completed schedules with 20 items	have been tabulated.	13.791983179388168
9293. the results are	now being analyzed.	19.015969532605073
9294. statistics have been recognized as a matter	of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during	the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs.	10.977256286414914
9295. the aimo organizations of both countries which maintain	administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate	responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information.	8.575894603742553
9296. however the statistical offices of both governments were	assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics.	13.724922956290312
9297. a bureau de la demographie was formed	under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the	section statistique of the secretariat general.	9.69382870686558
9298. eventually responsibility	for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to	the demographic division of the central statistical office.	12.204543451047963
9299. the 1952	demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi was directed by v neesen	a member of the irsac staff though the inquiry was carried	out under the auspices of aimo which has continuing responsibility	for demographic statistics in this territory.	9.741579113294495
9300. a member of the	irsac staff was recently delegated to cooperate	with aimo in the development of demographic statistics	in this territory.	14.147159197824633
9301. the initiation of sampling censuses in ruanda-urundi	and in the congo were major advances.	11.762704788735874
9302. we	will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into	operation later than the other.	10.953754882586594
9303. the radical nature of the	innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements.	10.44835522232039
9304. the term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary	investigations carried out in connection with the administrative	censuses was used for the new investigations.	16.51419214887238
9305. however the differences	field operations were transferred from	administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially	trained teams	of full-time african investigators	.	9.50776732204504
9306. these teams carried out the same operations	successively in different areas.	13.586438933380945
9307. sample	areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application	of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative	of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits.	9.18291808539247
9308. in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective	sampling.	18.768823509180088
9309. the populations of the various districts or other major divisions	were stratified by type of community and	where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy.	8.390626657905129
9310. sample	units were drawn systematically	within these strata.	13.915190642667962
9311. different	sampling ratios were applied under different conditions.	11.118618003375188
9312. higher	proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural	areas.	10.957705180640192
9313. about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new	investigation as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries.	10.151280294627615
9314. uniform questions definitions	and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country.	11.82244114848494
9315. data	were obtained separately on three classes of persons: residents	present; visitors.	9.669550099771405
9316. in the	reports summary results are given for both the de facto	and de jure populations; but the subsequent analysis	of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population	.	10.34106234138243
9317. these	changes represent in effect a shift from an administrative compilation	of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve	political and economic objectives to a systematic sampling census	of the whole african population.	7.154912304413868
9318. the population registration	system still has important functions.	16.386222825564015
9319. it supplies local data which are	useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive	studies in particular situations.	14.751053236669527
9320. it provides a frame for the sampling	census.	29.843712785571363
9321. it also provides a frame within which the registration	of vital events is gradually gaining force	obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this	.	10.944648034914062
9322. it is still used in making current population	estimates in post-census years though the value of these estimates	is open to question.	17.390961775581214
9323. finally it may have certain very important	less obvious values.	13.070933601820496
9324. even though the registers may have an incomplete	record of persons present in a particular area or include persons	no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date	of birth for some of the persons present	and supplementary information	for many others.	10.622956506980257
9325. the quality of the census	data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration	records in conjunction with the field inquiries.	13.921488674899965
9326. furthermore it may	be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method	in each of these sources on such subjects	as fertility mortality and migration during a given interval by using	information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.	8.724010816765466
9327. the first sampling census in the congo extended over a three-year	period 1955-57; the results were still being processed in 1959.	10.197211224690497
9328. it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved	equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry	can be carried through in one year and the results published more	expeditiously.	14.487196339120771
9329. it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses	be carried out at five-year intervals.	18.75991869184348
9330. reports already	issued on the sampling census 1955-57 in various areas run as follows	:	.	10.606644101593789
9331. this report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.	13.33655024148634
9332. other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content	have been issued for: .	11.447816526263711
9333. these area reports will be	followed according to present plans by a summary report which will	include a detailed statement on methods.	8.392623137398644
9334. with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might	more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes.	11.44040098322565
9335. toward the end of the semester's work he interviewed every	married class member at great length.	13.18615519530974
9336. he found as he had suspected	a	general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed	course was not really functional for these students.	12.910843388284999
9337. however	all admitted that the hind sight was not altogether lost.	9.669550099771405
9338. in their	own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they	had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some	insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time.	10.438758852918626
9339. in fact	they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design	a section exclusively for married students there should be at	the beginning some hind sight study; but they all hastened to	add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent.	8.400615484460246
9340. all of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could	be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course.	12.681164243595825
9341. a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section	for married students.	11.765391204513605
9342. as one of them expressed it it has done me	a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of	these not-yet-married people.	12.444848564697677
9343. i can now better see just what processes	provoked certain actions from me in the past.	11.652789133371265
9344. had i been in an all-married	section i would have missed this and i believe that this single	aspect has been of great personal value to me.	12.203061413602109
9345. this comment	and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification	for continuing the status quo.	12.084820921461745
9346. but the weight of feeling was heavily	in the opposite direction.	19.40066134493574
9347. thus the writer decided to hold one experimental	section of the functional preparation for marriage course	in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married-	that is prerequisite: marriage.	8.618813681838846
9348. this did not mean that married	students could not enroll in other mixed sections and some	of them largely because of scheduling difficulties did.	14.026763572501638
9349. but only	those already married could enroll in this one section.	16.01116842291938
9350. in addition	the regular sections do not allow freshmen; this one did.	14.174449266743885
9351. this action	was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that	a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become	sophomores.	10.913303427380008
9352. many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another.	19.66971972500783
9353. by permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity	for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get	auditors were encouraged.	8.690043264242961
9354. in the regular sections they have always	been more or less discouraged.	19.962744262889164
9355. the philosophy has been that if they could	find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit	and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively.	10.423173062387232
9356. besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight	as regularly enrolled students.	12.504079618937416
9357. but in this one section we welcomed	auditors.	29.13909166565978
9358. why?	28.49691246350829
9359.  for no particular reason other than that the writer	felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in attendance.	10.32585739526327
9360. many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially	in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior	year.	13.80410288634517
9361. incidentally it needs to be noted that because auditors were	permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until	at last it swelled to such proportions that this free auditing	policy had to be retracted.	8.721527854740966
9362. after that we began to get visitors	to class.	18.454544621913914
9363. this experimental class represented quite a variety	of students.	13.33655024148634
9364. it ranged from a freshman woman just married through	the various academic growth stages including one senior-graduate student	to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also	attended.	9.925636017644923
9365. it ranged from those with no children through students	in various stages of pregnancy to one 44-year-old male with four children	three of whom were teenagers.	9.777617961926572
9366. it ranged from two women members	who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married	and seemingly unable to conceive.	11.441291014343058
9367. one might digress at	this point and speculate that if it is wise to create special sections	for special status then why not a special section for women pregnant	before marriage and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children	and so on.	8.83017081566306
9368. some of these speculations may have some merit others	are somewhat ambiguous.	18.182815495071353
9369. but few who have experienced marriage can dispute	the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different	in marriage than in a pre-marital situation.	10.0962577656022
9370. the writer	began this special class by explaining his background thinking for	creating such a section in the first place.	12.241760826959005
9371. he made it clear from the	beginning that this was the students' opportunity and that the future	destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one.	10.82242409836888
9372. he did build a framework of academic respectability and one	which did not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other	existing campus course.	11.649483559610882
9373. this is to say that this was not a course	in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise	children.	16.923778785830592
9374. we already have courses covering those problems and so on.	14.462822529804008
9375. but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible.	11.585470758711296
9376. a steering committee of students was organized on the first day	whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate	the direction and pace the class was taking.	10.96657639007717
9377. the writer being	cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married	students did insist on there being included some hind sight material.	8.409778452916047
9378. but the greater part of semester time was actually centered around	the attitudes so we are married- now how do we make the best	of it?	12.420163574580547
9379.  or how do we enrich our already fine marriage?	13.648241595491166
9380. 	films were used as with all sections but with one big difference.	10.635267499930531
9381. our campus unfortunately owns no films.	13.349101001775427
9382. since they are all	either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to	be far in advance.	10.89038961239322
9383. the writer never knew from week to week just where	the section might be.	10.242653103537407
9384. for example the steering committee might announce	that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for	an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched.	13.779473066065188
9385. since	the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning	he had to go along with their decision- after of course pointing	out	whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one.	8.151719221858526
9386. thus the	films seen as they came in	were often out of context.	12.591263078892398
9387. nevertheless the writer has never experienced	such spontaneity of discussion after film showings.	10.01381971267754
9388. though	it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group	had sprung up within the class.	11.257626647071712
9389. they began to meet in the evenings and	carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered	in class.	10.005424035068703
9390. from a few students this group gradually increased to include	over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class and	many outsiders as well.	11.992419441317155
9391. also although only a few of the students were	intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported	that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships	were with members of that class.	11.892410219107802
9392. in fact they often revamped	their social activities to include class members previously unknown.	14.982935582849061
9393. supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the	other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably	deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group.	9.1225165480588
9394. these students although they might read various articles in popular	magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals.	11.022106581196695
9395. in addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles	there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read.	13.993129439451948
9396. whereas	a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read	other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different	direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas	and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest.	10.808155965279774
9397. since	the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered	throughout the various sections previous to this experiment	nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in single sections	he can only conclude that there must have been something contagious	within the specific group which caused this to occur.	8.186845924522224
9398. in the main this course took the following directional high roads:	a great deal of time was spent on processes for solving	marital differences.	13.029752091939026
9399. this was not a search for a magic formula	but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially	to all types of communication in marriage.	11.750698441381372
9400. in short it was centered	around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy.	16.205117146614754
9401. not until	the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further	specific adjustment areas such as sex in-laws religion	these same areas	in relation to their own future family life stages developing these	to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to	confront them at some time or other.	8.304840421304643
9402. as an example of this last	facet there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement.	20.031164306610336
9403. mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of	one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward	but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked.	8.14589304240258
9404. since	the course one member has lost her husband.	13.269026768804823
9405. this was not a particularly	shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her	that it might happen.	12.348270727466346
9406. but just when was an unknown and of course the	longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might	not.	11.691437376743108
9407. since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer	on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were	to her in this adjustment crisis.	9.025006969282767
9408. quite frequently class members	brought questions from their mates at home.	12.257878759269458
9409. these were often carefully	written out with a great deal of thought behind them.	16.737447570737967
9410. this added	a personal zest to class discussions and participation.	14.666783238248009
9411. both	sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage	were extremely enlightening.	9.599452540824268
9412. the writer sensed a much freer and more	frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before.	10.775365892393362
9413. he	felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men	in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so	essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might	think.	8.535804580188035
9414. this was probably much more meaningful because all the women	in the class emphasized it time and again.	12.192834301668556
9415. on the other hand the	women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than	have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males	as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with	love as most women seem to do.	9.188904519294217
9416. in the reproductive area it could	be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students	had previously in mixed marital status sections.	11.177937060063153
9417. perhaps this	was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent.	13.9325042917308
9418. never	in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth	discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various	stages of pregnancy.	9.715476989823753
9419. there was a particularly marvelous opportunity	for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented	from a childless couple to and including every trimester.	11.340843176341787
9420. in fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student	had to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the	safe side.	14.043084746152005
9421. there was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester.	23.94952421882959
9422. thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference	between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief	structuring experience.	13.248091776827476
9423. it was predicted that kohnstamm-negative	subjects would adhere to more liberal concretistic reports	of what the ambiguous figure looked like as reflecting their	hesitancy about taking chances.	9.924599521259779
9424. this was true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative	subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people	in action.	13.266557409523388
9425. responses such as rope with a loop in it and two	guilford-martin	the three personality inventories	stdcr; guilford-martin gamin; guilford-martin	were filled out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive	subjects and 19 of the kohnstamm-negative subjects.	7.320476697650557
9426. these were the	same subjects who were given the rorschach test.	13.409389805809305
9427. some predictions	had been made concerning factors r n i and co on these	inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security	aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as	being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity.	7.8968075126993575
9428. only	co differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level	.	12.104786665496118
9429. one prediction had been made about the difference	in	security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm	reactivity when informed and those who did not.	10.455629821999658
9430. the nonreactors	had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably	secure nonreactors and secure reactors being used	as the groups for comparative personality studies.	9.488339800308188
9431. it was predicted	that those who shifted in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly	from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators	refer to as the inferiority factor.	9.959757812244852
9432. all of the subjects	in the kohnstamm-negative and kohnstamm-positive groups	were compared with those subjects	who shifted in conditions 3 or 4.	13.656053974924317
9433. a t test on these	two groups shifters vs nonshifters gave a t value of 2.	9.413175138645114
9434. 405	which	is significant on the two-tail test at the .	11.793662721363662
9435. individual differences in kohnstamm	reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the	subjects used in the study.	9.299991600941464
9436. only 27% gave a positive	kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon.	12.390412190566092
9437. there were 49% who did not give a positive reaction	even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and	had been given a demonstration.	11.392769440892389
9438. there were 24% who	shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured	as to the normalcy of the kohnstamm-positive reaction.	11.995915590653823
9439. among	this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind	of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred.	8.849963183513564
9440. one subject	changed when given only the information that some people have something	happen to their arm when they relax.	10.94057675957648
9441. five subjects did	not change until they had been told that some people have something	happen to their arm what that something was and also were given a	demonstration.	8.787217600569988
9442. four subjects did not change even then but needed	the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances	was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed	while others did not.	8.878478719807669
9443. at no time was it implied by the experimenter	that the subject's initial reaction was deviant.	11.202333144943426
9444. the subjects were	only given information about other possibilities of normal reaction.	12.957840546200554
9445. those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state	did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal	people who did not react in this fashion.	9.3807808495852
9446. this information was accepted	with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not	show arm-levitation must be preventing it.	10.706200255335153
9447. these subjects implied that	they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried.	9.495459372186279
9448. the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1	is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility	.	11.706916437669005
9449. in no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter	indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary	contraction.	9.501255384655657
9450. moreover when the experimenter did inform those	subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm	rise once they relaxed the kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced	in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation.	10.3225227085375
9451. they	continued to give an arm-elevation.	13.35433068974081
9452. a differential suggestibility would	have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information	to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute	their nai^ve kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion.	9.2990757946302
9453. autosuggestibility	the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own	expectations of the outcome	to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction because of his	also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following	reasons: the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise	when their arms rose and manifestations of the phenomenon despite	anticipations of something else happening	and maybe falling an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one	.	7.472815936507461
9454. a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate	as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they	were informed of the possibilities of normal reactions different	from those which they gave.	10.36362880579044
9455. while they were told that there were some	normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed	that there were other normals who reacted as they had.	8.449349294650279
9456. there	was no implication made that their initial reaction	was less preferred than the presence of levitation.	12.162309389102267
9457. a more	tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge	and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible	for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax since any reaction	seemed acceptable to the examiner as normal.	8.106214983129782
9458. the	nai^ve state condition 1 could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting	one for 24% of the subjects in this study.	10.052790226589156
9459. they were not free	to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there	was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable	behavior.	9.885538183141819
9460. instructions to relax ie to be spontaneous	and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently	reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions	had been given.	10.235431202732912
9461. while other conditions might be even more effective	in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm	reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would	have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject	which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of	responsibility for his behavior.	7.277915237024915
9462. alcohol ingestion succeeded in	changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject	.	10.358652090748608
9463. this subject who	has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did	not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized	conditions used in this experiment while sober.	9.987753115535387
9464. after two drinks	containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely.	13.965887009685972
9465. there was evident	delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of	the freedom of movement.	21.079665427342306
9466. she described herself as having the same kind	of irresponsible feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis.	11.143265754198652
9467. she ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect	they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which	she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might	seem appropriate to relax these controls.	8.169067925196236
9468. many subjects attributed	differences	in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective	control- voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived	it and involuntary as the kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it.	9.430321309774381
9469. these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously	when they were told that there were people who reacted differently	than they had.	10.163587212379547
9470. the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid	experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no	control.	12.912833480617111
9471. they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention	of control factors.	12.451059830395325
9472. they felt that they too could counteract	the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced	the reaction.	12.899955624679878
9473. some of those who did not initially react with	an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with	control factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily.	11.833134263181773
9474. one subject spontaneously asked do	you suppose i was unconsciously keeping it down before?	12.585813937402614
9475.  another	said that her arm did not go up at first because i wouldn't	let it; i thought it wasn't supposed to.	8.565533214767227
9476. this subject was	one	who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but	not in the first.	11.428010187111974
9477. she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the	first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing.	10.081933725650895
9478. she	explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were not letting	themselves relax.	12.828476618779314
9479. when informed that there were some persons who	did not have their arm go up she commented i don't see how	they can prevent it.	9.238559129247644
9480. in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation	for nonreactivity given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects the	kohnstamm-negative	subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis	to explain nonreactivity.	13.834181180029086
9481. they felt that they were relaxing as much as	they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent	response must be on an unconscious level.	10.11065381681601
9482. the above discussion	does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in	abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could	be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation.	10.929603643519465
9483. one kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested	in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as	follows: you feel they're going up and you're on a stage and	it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's	what's supposed to happen.	8.207303554083826
9484. she then described her experience as	one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of	being in which she relinquished control.	10.368576582042767
9485. however she was able to relax	and yield to the moment.	15.155312840084536
9486. it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive	subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are	kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give up their control and	allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors.	12.105157984625752
9487. it is our belief	that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the	kohnstamm-positive	subjects in some of the other experimental situations	to be discussed below.	12.674759226280063
9488. thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced	in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality	factor.	12.583934233782132
9489. the kohnstamm-positive subjects	seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible	in the external world.	9.603522732442489
9490. there was a significantly greater number	in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while	a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline.	11.570193495619725
9491. this	occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going	downhill.	11.564449967083165
9492. they knew that their perceptual experience differed from	objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting	on the aniseikonic lenses.	10.851338011789531
9493. yet they were not so bound by past experience	and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to	be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be.	9.792727916862038
9494. the	change in perceptions by some of the kohnstamm-negative subjects	after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions	suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with	their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations.	9.76774575086352
9495. they	were able to experience at first in terms of past conventionality.	12.33835961799312
9496. when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they	were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present.	11.49132113935214
9497. it might	be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong;	that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as threatening	until they are tested and proved otherwise.	8.674385223072354
9498. while	the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they	gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one	of the kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not on the first trial	perceive the tilt illusion.	9.938174407844633
9499. it would have been desirable for	the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable	being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method.	12.672123897969593
9500. the	structured schools were in an industrial city with three-family tenement	houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable	section of middle-class homes.	9.593286882835937
9501. the unstructured schools were in	a large suburban community predominantly middle- to upper-middle class	but fringed by an industrial area.	8.998955821926716
9502. in order to equate the samples	on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis	of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods.	13.362790602080656
9503. school principals and guidance	workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research	team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas.	8.18783879425211
9504. an objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from	these data.	12.190172349217661
9505. equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from	upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods.	9.15030195543896
9506. individual	differences in maturation and the development of readiness for	learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most	children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school	achievement.	9.84671722495424
9507. therefore third-grade children were chosen as subjects	for this study.	10.900188788523568
9508. for purposes of sample selection only	we obtained group test scores of reading	achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade	population in each school system.	10.004226894630424
9509. the subjects for this study were	randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution one-third	as underachievers one-third medium and one-third over-achievers.	9.486024303055078
9510. children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation	below the regression line of each total third-grade school population	were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection.	9.149497973686051
9511. over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression	line in their school system.	9.673483837632276
9512. the final sample was not significantly	different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement	or intelligence test scores.	12.41613839274991
9513. twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured	schools furnished 156 cases 87 boys and 69 girls.	8.834168570742513
9514. eight classrooms	in three structured schools furnished 72 cases 36 boys and 36	girls.	11.420701888396183
9515. administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size	in the structured schools.	9.669550099771405
9516. it was assumed that the sampling	procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables	under investigation.	16.291176859036685
9517. an interview	schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire	were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen	in the home.	8.680944649973751
9518. the parent was asked to describe the child's typical	behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity	to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self	and others irrational conformity to rules orderliness punctuality	and need for certainty.	10.518467027808288
9519. the interviewers were instructed not to suggest	answers and as much as possible to record the parents' actual	words as they described the child's behavior in home situations.	9.9308182154123
9520. the rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing	the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity	then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the	case records.	9.195928132121104
9521. final ratings were made on the basis of a point system	which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors	recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that	was deviant from the discovered norms.	7.8187205883266095
9522. children scoring high in compulsivity	were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations	where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards	and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals.	8.205477167781657
9523. the low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned	about such matters.	10.61385277229228
9524. for instance the following statement was rated	low in compulsivity she's naturally quite neat about things	but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy.	10.72684918951485
9525. but she	cleans it up very well when i remind her.	12.790726695706343
9526. castaneda et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for	use with children.	10.957705180640192
9527. the taylor scale was adapted from the minnesota	multiphastic personality inventory with item selection based upon	clinical definitions of anxiety.	9.368877004357456
9528. there is much research evidence to	validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who	are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees.	16.771230030476957
9529. reliability and validation	work with the children's anxiety scale by castaneda et	al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with	the adult scale.	6.851131556702235
9530. although the taylor scale was designed as a group	testing device in this study it was individually administered by psychologically	trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children	in reading the items.	9.449812029692495
9531. the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with	a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity.	11.35774252393607
9532. the two ratings yield a	correlation of +.	18.584464434264284
9533. 04 which is not significantly different from zero;	therefore we have measured two different characteristics.	9.685318321721805
9534. in theory	compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect	a negative association except for the possibility that for many	children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell	the amount of anxiety they suffer.	11.197076794023397
9535. the issue of interaction between	anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later.	14.733756846956979
9536. in the primary grades reading permeates almost every aspect of	school progress and the children's early experiences of success or	failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement	that is relatively enduring throughout the following years.	9.573705594104885
9537. in establishing	criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden	the scope beyond the reading act itself.	10.058592376379565
9538. the predicted interaction	effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement.	12.010194183656237
9539. the stanford achievement test form j was administered	by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six sub-tests:	paragraph meaning word meaning spelling language arithmetic	computation and arithmetic reasoning.	8.499696448454491
9540. all of these sub-tests	involve reading except arithmetic computation.	22.545472361485462
9541. scores are stated	in grade-equivalents on a national norm.	11.022962806421964
9542. the battery median grade-equivalent	was used in data analysis in this study.	12.957840546200554
9543. the wechsler	intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample	third-grade child by a clinical worker.	9.646584389395406
9544. the relationship of intelligence	test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact	; therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis	it was necessary to control this factor.	12.113194569891464
9545. the criterion score	used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement.	9.923610580026844
9546. it is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement	test score and the score that would be predicted by the iq.	16.25710163266751
9547. for example on the basis of the regression equation a child with	an iq of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement	test score of 4.	11.152478448846084
9548. if a child with an iq	of 120 scored 5.	22.579311380533703
9549. 5 in achievement his discrepancy score would be	+.	14.596160759377764
9550. 7 of one year of over-achievement.	18.072884649204624
9551. a child with an	iq of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score	of 3.	11.602764721037458
9552. if such a child scored 3.	26.942667090263445
9553. 0 his discrepancy score would be -.	11.118618003375188
9554. 5 of one year of under-achievement.	22.48693174532317
9555. in this manner	the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing	discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting	from other variables.	9.670437257423806
9556. _test of interaction of compulsivity	tables 1 and 2 present the results of	the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the	descriptive variable.	9.331235809154773
9557. figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of	each sub-group graphically.	9.669550099771405
9558. first of all as we had surmised the highly	compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly	better on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured	schools.	12.646015635526659
9559. it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity	within the structured schools the high compulsive children do	better.	13.28766210544273
9560. no significant difference was found in achievement between	high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school.	11.483997444411298
9561. the	hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching	method was supported in this case at the .	8.781772700904357
9562. while	we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school	setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured	we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives	within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning	reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives.	10.148000732151319
9563. indeed	their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis	although the difference was not significant.	8.450640073948662
9564. we speculate that compulsives	in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of	the lack of systemization in their school setting but that their need	to organize is so intense that they struggle to induce	the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the	environment.	9.806347311666785
9565. it is interesting to note that medium compulsives	in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores	.	14.18671040293482
9566. possibly their compulsivity was not strong	enough to cause them to build their own structure.	10.268551155089023
9567. our conjecture	is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons	are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each	lesson that aid him in systematizing his work.	9.226926332888597
9568. when helped by a high	degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does	test of interaction of anxiety	the statistical analyses of achievement in	relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the	two are presented in tables 3 and 4.	8.789223669927317
9569. figure 2 is a graph of the mean	achievement scores of each group.	9.070074471681158
9570. as predicted the highly anxious children	in the unstructured schools score more poorly than those	in	the structured schools.	11.609135780050025
9571. the interaction effect which is significant	at the .	12.98623016976681
9572. 01 level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores.	13.972891256720834
9573. while	high anxiety children achieve significantly less well in the	unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at	least as well as the average in the structured classroom.	8.216781158998431
9574. the	most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement	in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured	schools.	10.413086358366998
9575. according to the theory proposed this is a consequence	of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated	for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment.	9.391076510474974
9576. the	fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is	thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or	under-achievement	these children exhibit.	11.281623719016311
9577. the child with high anxiety may	first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because	his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and	memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts	to master the problem.	7.817694960710715
9578. failure confirms the threat and the intensity	of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more	difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the	decrement in performance is pronounced.	10.542167881838049
9579. the individual with high	anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task	with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination.	8.409778452916047
9580. but	the symbols he is asked to learn are simple.	12.603196852879229
9581. as shown earlier the	highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple	elements.	11.087087075485773
9582. success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of	discrimination are improved.	13.094756592247752
9583. by the time the child first attacks the	actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with	all of the elements of words.	11.26587146265956
9584. apparently academic challenge in the structured	setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high	anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state	without becoming confused or panicked.	10.417685997283119
9585. sarason et al	present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like	situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives	supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher.	7.608394180559667
9586. although the	present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the	results do not confirm their conclusion.	11.549720006723645
9587. observers in the two school	systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools	to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the	unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting.	7.622551083401702
9588. yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only	in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average	in the structured setting.	10.078871580708054
9589. analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative	ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements.	9.78608604667884
9590. analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding	strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to	eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts.	10.335767022075341
9591. up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms	of individuals.	14.700827247419753
9592. roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose:	to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals.	12.457908737315682
9593. for example:	a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying.	11.47281509929062
9594. let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones	we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation	and analysis.	11.071246574719058
9595. one should keep in mind that many of the exciting	possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been	used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other	areas.	12.906344503751894
9596. the president of a small firm selling restaurant	products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen	for his business.	14.233580432201974
9597. interviewing checking references training the	salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive-	and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory	performance was too high.	7.859868164022279
9598. it was his experience that only one good salesman	was found out of every seven hired- and only one was hired out	of every seven interviewed.	12.895792913714804
9599. roleplaying was offered as a solution-	and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited	to a hotel conference room where the president explained the difficulty	he had and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who	just did not work out.	7.190463929466826
9600. in place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires	checking their references interviewing them asking them to	be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them.	11.178486246677386
9601. each person	was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples.	11.326924905405464
9602. each salesman	was to read a sheet containing a description of the product.	16.2269535842736
9603. in	the testing room he was to make successively three presentations	to three different people.	11.355757428530968
9604. in the testing room three of the veteran	salesmen served as antagonists.	19.556424362412343
9605. one handled the salesman in a	friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitating	manner.	9.936961324245127
9606. each was told to purchase material if he felt like it.	12.278630237849624
9607. the	antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other	presentations.	11.401292627424878
9608. after each presentation the antagonist wrote his judgment	of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting of the	president three of his salesmen and a psychologist.	9.917802389492007
9609. ten salesmen	were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon.	15.647596217001475
9610. this procedure	was repeated one day a month for four months.	20.32190677318781
9611. the batting average	of one success out of seven increased to one out of three.	11.833392450394928
9612. the president	of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped	one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred	per cent.	11.245898617901863
9613. the reason for the value of this procedure was simply	that the applicants were tested at work in different situations	by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen	conducted themselves with different but typical restaurant owners	and managers.	9.943323703071304
9614. they were in a sense tried out in realistic situations.	25.2511384333004
9615. from the point of view of the applicants less time	was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal out of it as well	as some insights into their performances.	11.737456575248826
9616. another use of roleplaying	for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in	real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during	the daily course of work.	9.95689687724601
9617. the position of receptionist was	opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other	girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher	prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions.	10.135782038749298
9618. all applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist.	20.97955928135454
9619. at the end of work one day the personnel man took the applicants	one at a time asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk	and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to	the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes.	12.805670758596428
9620. each girl was independently tested by the personnel man and	he served not only as the director but as the antagonist and the observer.	11.240669508533346
9621. somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom	he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat	mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did	the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing	wit sparkle and aplomb.	8.302963049573412
9622. she was hired and was found to be entirely	satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day.	12.039614131241997
9623. in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area	since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision	but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen	in dynamic functioning.	8.630459825511101
9624. some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying	for analysis may help explain the procedure.	13.949820755699756
9625. an engineer	had been made the works manager of a firm supplanting a retired employee	who had been considered outstandingly successful.	8.932327563379724
9626. the engineer had	more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was	considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for	his technical competence and was regarded as a comer.	11.045694065099942
9627. however	he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position.	15.898848380674586
9628. he seemed	to antagonize everyone.	25.66056898750899
9629. turnover rates of personnel went up production	dropped and morale was visibly reduced.	9.070074471681158
9630. despite the fact that he	was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor	administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him.	16.266888300162627
9631. at	the insistence of his own supervisor- the president of the firm he	enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders.	10.710334321778824
9632. he played	a number of typical situations before observers other supervisors who	kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought	was wrong.	11.537832642777731
9633. entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in	criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an	extent.	8.026882005052693
9634. he did not really listen to others had little interest in their	ideas and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right	way.	15.996293751760502
9635. the entire group of managers explained in great detail a number	of human relations errors that he made.	9.625474991728858
9636. one by one these	errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors.	13.825014304523112
9637. he admitted his behavior and defended it.	15.231465433954329
9638. he refused to change	his approach and instead he attacked high and low- the officials for	their not backing him and subordinates for their laxness stupidity	and stubbornness.	9.803396931973506
9639. after the diagnosing he left the course convinced	that it could do him no good.	12.47638323995676
9640. we may say that his problem	was diagnosed but that he refused treatment.	16.417742217903754
9641. the engineer turned works	manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it.	10.817702353179955
9642. we	may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success	had he learned some human relations skills; or we may say that	his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his	refusal to adjust to the opinions of others.	9.246191403409371
9643. in any case he refused	to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made	over.	12.867200394632384
9644. another case may be given in illustration of a successful	use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive	analysis.	10.747901268200886
9645. in a course for supermarket operators a district manager	who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly	successful as a store manager found that in supervising other	managers he was having a difficult time.	8.155694885198978
9646. on playing some typical situations	before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated	as unsatisfactory.	11.972993158022506
9647. he was told he displayed for example a sense	of superiority- and he answered: well i am supposed to know	all the answers aren't i?	9.909403934758586
9648.  he was criticized for his curtness	and abruptness- and he answered: i am not working to become	popular.	14.059310915344689
9649. on being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered:	i have to make decisions.	11.696103978849662
9650. in short	as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and	defends himself.	13.53780763738168
9651. however in this case the district manager was led	to see the errors of his ways.	14.175853827186106
9652. the necessary step between diagnosis and	training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms.	15.926370692743143
9653. how this	was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial	problem.	10.645258980112507
9654. the director helped tailor-make a check list of the district	manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences	commenting on the mistakes they felt he made.	10.968334976663295
9655. these errors were	then collected and written on a blackboard condensing similar ideas.	10.100086864412003
9656. eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual	to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the	particular errors.	10.90123135154762
9657. they were asked to vote true if they thought	they had seen him make the error false if they thought he had	not; and cannot say if they were not certain.	9.288939888133184
9658. the manager	sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went	up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard.	10.351843785236357
9659. no comments	were made during the voting.	14.899382480025864
9660. the results looked as follows: f.	19.79923841577052
9661. the first eight of these eighteen statements which received	at least one-half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis	checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager	roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared.	8.212445289096639
9662. to prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself	only during the sessions they were rather lengthy	the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that	he would not know what to expect new antagonists were brought on the	scene unexpectedly and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately	behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in	a manner for which he had been previously criticized.	9.47960213767271
9663. after	every session the check marks were totaled up and graphed and in this	way the supervisor's progress was charted.	8.026882005052693
9664. in life	we learn to play our roles and we freeze into patterns which become	so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do.	12.191253656845689
9665. we can see	others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us	better than we see ourselves.	10.552669987043382
9666. to learn what we do is the first step	for improvement.	15.656934517697971
9667. to accept the validity of the judgments of others is	the second step.	14.251926688570894
9668. to want to change is the third step.	17.797308820546554
9669. to practice new	procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the	fourth step.	10.348303960455212
9670. to use these new ways in daily life is the last step.	13.562092939331109
9671. roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to	training.	9.669550099771405
9672. when an evaluative situation is set up and no concern	is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that	roleplaying is used for evaluation.	11.383363764946722
9673. observers can see a person engaged	in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion.	8.61869229186204
9674. this behavior is more veridical- or true than other	testing behavior for some types of evaluation and so can give quick and	accurate estimates of complex functioning.	9.88976263206359
9675. while roleplaying	for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents	one of the major uses of this procedure.	0.0
9676. training	the objective of this chapter is to clarify	the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts.	10.125147890601434
9677. in addition the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will	be reviewed.	17.000400718489775
9678. the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated	rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this	unique training area.	11.840893748964605
9679. the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying	application from the previous discussion of training are twofold:	spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new.	9.782508071278205
9680. it is not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient's	communicating an introject has appeared and is holding sway.	16.055786078400967
9681. one	learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's	suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality	which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances parrotlike.	7.469389687977654
9682. the	content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition as	if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so	simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom	common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over	from a parent until he experiences it as part of him.	9.411731739018052
9683. one hebephrenic	woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow	phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite her wracking	sobs and streaming cheeks i felt only a cold annoyance with her.	8.30632930441514
9684. eventually such incidents became more sporadic and more sharply demarcated	from her day-after-day behavior and in one particular session	after several minutes of such behavior- which as usual went on	without any accompanying words from her- she asked eagerly did	you see granny?	8.374395021424876
9685.  at first i did not know what she meant; i	thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from	seeing	her grandmother in their distant home-city.	10.381743019500924
9686. then i realized that	she had been deliberately showing me this time what granny was like;	and when i replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch.	10.130880989159342
9687. at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother-introject	began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she muttered	in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside	me! i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this;	but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room	from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory	tone your	father despises you! again i at first misconstrued	this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast	through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter	conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased.	6.975848415126124
9688. then i replied coldly if you despise me why don't you	say so directly?	13.430565410340128
9689.  she looked confused at this and i felt sure	it had been a wrong response for me to make.	10.516409745435464
9690. it then occurred to me to	ask is that what that woman told you?	15.384040762164279
9691.  she clearly agreed	that this had been the case.	15.23704424123961
9692. i realized now that she had been showing	me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her	mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of	the reasons why she hated that woman inside her.	9.307250729369251
9693. what had been an unmanageably	powerful introject was now despite its continuing charge	of energy disconcerting to me sufficiently within control of her ego	that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.	8.149230433455084
9694. earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety	of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would	sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in	the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice.	9.673017706396973
9695. a somewhat	less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine who used to often seclude	herself in her room often sounded through the closed door- as i	would find on passing by between our sessions- for all the world	like two persons a scolding mother and a defensive child.	7.411833463682986
9696. particularly	hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which	the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the	therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself	only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself	he finds distinctly unwelcome.	10.44676791999982
9697. i have found time and again that	some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part	of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis; and only	when i can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of	my personality does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of	the patient's behavior.	8.213592142627272
9698. for example one hebephrenic man used to	annoy me month after month by saying whenever i got up to leave and	made my fairly steoreotyped comment that i would be seeing him on the	following day or whenever you're welcome in a notably condescending	fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank him	for the privilege of spending the hour with him and he were thus pointing	up my failure to utter a humbly grateful thank you to him	at the end of each session.	9.714856116199929
9699. eventually it became clear to me partly	with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my	condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his	condescending	you're welcome was very accurately personifying	an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own	demeanor over these months on each of these occasions when i had	bid him good-bye with the consoling note each time that the healing	christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered	again on the morrow.	7.153473780319125
9700. another patient a paranoid woman for many	months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow	patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building	as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met.	9.265895490527749
9701. this behavior on her part subsided only after i had come to see the	uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand her arranging	the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking or turning	the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others	and on the other hand my own coming stolidly into her room despite	her persistent and vociferous objections bringing my big easy chair	with me usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred	to keep in a very cold state and plunking myself down in my chair-	in short behaving as if i owned her room.	7.78829508900578
9702. here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced	in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming	verbal or nonverbal statement.	11.09943746855014
9703. one finds for example	that a terse and stereotyped	verbal expression seeming at first to be	a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy	as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and	the most unconventional of meanings.	7.564115084626706
9704. more than anything it is the	therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype	which helps these meanings to become revealed something like a spread-out	deck of cards on sporadic occasions over the passage of the	patient's and his months of work together.	9.570868615402722
9705. one cannot assume of course	that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype	at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when	the stereotype was uttered; probably it is correct to think of it as	a matter of a well-grooved stereotyped mode of expression- and no	or but a few other communicational grooves as yet- being there	available for the patient's use as newly-emerging emotions and	ideas well up in him over the course of months.	8.369006275294103
9706. but it is true that the	therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are	at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel	of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from	one another.	12.036409387614489
9707. sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a	how are you now?	15.612540294179587
9708.  or an i want to go home or whatever-	but a nonverbal one which reveals itself gradually as the condensed	expression of more than one latent meaning.	12.533143778841218
9709. a hebephrenic man used	to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his	largely-silent	hours with his therapist.	9.22714845677061
9710. when the therapist came to feel	on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him what is that	bill- hello or farewell?	12.473717628470618
9711.  the patient replied both dearie-	two in one.	15.448137229179506
9712. of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression	that which seems best to give release and communicational expression	to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter.	11.335190725128493
9713. it is	no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated	of all schizophrenic patients shows as one of his characteristic	symptoms laughter- laughter which now makes one feel scorned	or hated which now makes one feel like weeping or which now gives	one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and	which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which	could in no way be	conveyed by any number of words words which are so	unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another.	7.554239410890506
9714. to	a much less full extent the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus	has a comparable communicative function; in working with these patients	the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling	over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus	not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze	but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute	forms of communication in which from time to time quite different	things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently	aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them	in words.	8.256879854858667
9715. as i have been intimating in the schizophrenic-	and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question	which i have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which	one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas	which are at an unconscious level well sorted out but rather a condensed	expression of feelings and ideas which even in the unconscious	have yet to become well differentiated from one another.	8.14434528079651
9716. freeman	cameron and mcghie in their description of the disturbances of thinking	found in chronic schizophrenic patients say in regard to condensation	that h the lack of adequate discrimination between the	self and the environment and the objects contained therein h in itself	is the prototypical condensation.	9.154473347287153
9717. in my experience a	great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are	so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated	from figurative meanings in his subjective experience.	9.421261180246672
9718. thus he may	be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment	by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental	events on the global scene.	9.771403120053224
9719. recently for example a paranoid woman's	large-scale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive	curiosity which has become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic	of mid-twentieth-century human culture developed itself before the	end of the session into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peeking	at her partially exposed breast as indeed i was.	7.333086056787253
9720. or equally	often a concretistic-seeming particularistic-seeming statement may consist	with its mundane exterior in a form of poetry- may be full	of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression:	a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speaking.	9.351594144157502
9721. of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often	than not entirely unaware.	11.228049622321159
9722. his subjective experience may be a remarkably	concretistic one.	15.933779352900387
9723. one hebephrenic women confided to me i	live in a world of words as if to her words were fully concrete	objects; burnham in his excellent article concerning schizophrenic	communication includes mention of similar clinical material.	9.10152424202935
9724. a borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various	theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate	fashion during session after session with me were like great	cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him; as he	spoke i was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high	in the air from a docked steamship.	9.721524957487015
9725. the many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary	information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's	contents around prefixes stems suffixes etc.	9.519235923390848
9726. a significant	reduction	in the voume of store information is thus realized especially	for a highly inflected language such as russian.	10.331010770606548
9727. for english the reduction	in size is less striking.	13.609016979205112
9728. this approach requires that:	each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence	between the occurrence and dictionary entries and the information	retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized	into a description of the particular word.	10.44177795990109
9729. the logical scheme used	to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in	the dictionary file.	9.646584389395406
9730. implementation of the latter requires storage of	information needed only for synthesis.	14.816750301984575
9731. we suggest the application	of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem.	12.9372129620693
9732. but first we must define two terms so that their meaning will be	clearly understood:  form- any unique sequence of alphabetic	characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed	by a space.	9.506529901672298
9733. occurrence- an instance of a form in text.	10.530932308755343
9734. we propose a method for selecting only dictionary information	required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information	directly to the occurrences in text.	9.666762164744704
9735. we accomplish this by compiling	a list of text forms as text is read by the computer.	9.833174109624084
9736. a random-storage	scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical	way to compile this text-form list.	11.945970697687185
9737. dictionary forms found to match	forms in the text list are marked.	9.345058977386529
9738. a location in the computer store	is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the	form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences	of the form in text.	8.910884728010025
9739. finally information is retrieved from the dictionary	as required by stages of the translation process- the grammatic	description for sentence-structure determination equivalent-choice	information for semantic analysis and target-language equivalents	for output construction.	7.841393323919072
9740. the dictionary is a form dictionary	at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching	text occurrences with dictionary entries.	16.13321421452561
9741. also the dictionary	is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and	the file of information that pertains to these forms.	10.257501148037221
9742. a more detailed	description of dictionary operations- text lookup and dictionary	modification- give a clearer picture.	12.296021707234328
9743. text lookup as we will	describe it consists of three steps.	11.378780338421992
9744. the first is compiling a list	of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text	occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each	occurrence.	10.796625962503985
9745. for this step the computer memory is separated into three	regions: cells in the w-region are used for storage of the forms	in the text-form list; cells in the x-region and y region	are reserved as information cells for text forms.	7.881788930789685
9746. when an occurrence	f is isolated during text reading a random memory address f	the address of a cell in the x-region is computed from the form	of f.	9.696981859400154
9747. let f denote the form of f.	19.16350798751663
9748. if cell f has not previously	been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form	list it is now assigned as the information cell of f.	10.594283653460662
9749. the form itself	is stored in the next available cells of the w-region beginning	in cell f.	13.255445807050117
9750. the address f and the number of cells required to	store the form are written in f; the information cell f is saved	to represent the text occurrence.	11.318746374200517
9751. text reading continues with the next	occurrence.	11.867291106449708
9752. let us assume that f is identical to the form	of an occurrence f which preceded f in the text.	11.551348807723544
9753. when this situation	exists the address f will equal f which was produced from f.	11.50188505177375
9754. if f was assigned as the information cell for f the routine can	detect that f is identical to f by comparing f with the form	stored at location f.	9.659090496756573
9755. the address f is stored in the cell f.	12.204673387645432
9756. when	as in this case the two forms match the address f is saved to	represent the occurrence f.	10.937130340964535
9757. text reading continues with the next	occurrence.	11.867291106449708
9758. a third situation is possible.	22.071666207767368
9759. the formula for computing	random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a	distinct address for each distinct form.	10.006956367629824
9760. thus when more than one distinct	form leads to a particular cell in the x-region a chain of	information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell	in the chain for each form.	10.241253456573949
9761. if f leads to an address f that is equal	to the address computed from f even though f does not match f	the chain of information cells is extended from f by storing the	address of the next available cell in the y-region f in f.	7.593382857873045
9762. the	cell f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned	as the information cell of f.	9.412054727957594
9763. a third cell can be added by storing	the address of another y-cell in f; similarly as many cells	are added as are required.	9.18988997023239
9764. each information cell in the chain contains	the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assigned	is stored.	12.006869101738951
9765. each cell except the last in the chain also contains	the address of the y-cell that is the next element of the chain;	the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the	chain.	9.768094494376909
9766. hence when the address f is computed from f the cell f	and	all y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether	f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form	list and the chain.	10.487889360196874
9767. when the information cell for f has been determined	it is saved as a representation of f.	10.803537984830022
9768. text reading continues	with the next occurrence.	13.915190642667962
9769. text reading is terminated when	a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list.	8.29272515769823
9770. this initiates the second step of glossary lookup- connecting the	information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms.	10.48620007506182
9771. each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form	list.	13.188666762563013
9772. each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information	cell of the matching text form is saved.	10.625339245406959
9773. the number of dictionary	forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved.	14.701848624334346
9774. these two pieces	of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text	form constitute the table of dictionary usage.	10.43193895125053
9775. if each text form is	marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained	in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have	been read.	8.331558999077057
9776. the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken	at that time.	12.818500345915622
9777. each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form	list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in	the form list during text reading.	9.363436047383692
9778. a random address f that lies within	the x-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the	i-th dictionary form.	10.331010770606548
9779. if cell f is an information cell it and	any information cells in the y-region that have been linked to f	each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching	form is stored.	8.083607816693855
9780. the dictionary form is compared with each of these	text forms.	14.82755956311037
9781. when a match is found an entry is made in the table of	dictionary usage.	13.833946735069613
9782. if cell f is not an information cell we conclude	that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list.	13.870866209505621
9783. these	two steps essentially complete the lookup operation.	11.118618003375188
9784. the final step	merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information	that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list and	uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach	the appropriate information to each occurrence in text.	8.944221160015212
9785. the list of	text forms in the w-region of memory and the contents of the information	cells in the x and y-regions are no longer required.	8.677007509580344
9786. only	the assignment of the information cells is important.	13.124727071899564
9787. the	first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis	of the input text.	9.442064507626279
9788. the grammatical description of each occurrence in	the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis.	10.351870993004653
9789. a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any	type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached	to each text occurrence.	9.239416239795414
9790. the grammatic descriptions of all forms	in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary	file.	11.95431889504004
9791. the order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe.	12.776686676726651
9792. when entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary	usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store	in the computer.	9.946474180143396
9793. this selection-rejection process takes place as the	file is read.	12.508271769542546
9794. each entry that is selected for storage is written into	the next available cells of the w-region.	10.590283081361788
9795. the address of the	first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information	cell for the form.	12.393021208566594
9796. when the complete file has been	read the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary	have been stored in the w-region; the information cell assigned	to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description	of the form it represents.	9.694063208346838
9797. hence the description of each text	occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell	addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information	cell for each occurrence.	9.347760840630936
9798. the only requirements on	dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each	form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form	list and that information for each form be available in a sequence	identical with the sequence of the forms.	10.188092959591897
9799. this leaves the ordering	of entries variable.	15.755914550576229
9800. two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary	are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms	rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more	than one dictionary form.	10.13747203832327
9801. the former is intended to decrease the amount	of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage.	11.248477477411878
9802. the latter is useful	for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence	reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents.	12.619705703930842
9803. applying	the techniques developed at harvard for generating a paradigm from	a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of	a word to the dictionary at once.	7.5253734427739
9804. an extension of the principle would	permit entering a grammatic description of each form.	13.664686243965894
9805. equivalents could	be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the	dictionary or after the word has been studied in context.	9.955473071706257
9806. thus one can	think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form.	13.046296339527323
9807. if	all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary	a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible.	8.838184801819748
9808. for example the inflected forms of a word can be represented	insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to	be attached.	12.639814982517795
9809. the full forms can be derived from such information	just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list.	10.511987875993992
9810. similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the	equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they	apply	to each form.	9.362718968525545
9811. the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon	such summarization or designed around it.	10.962864524965967
9812. when irregularity and variation	prevent summarizing information is written in complete detail.	13.838615833370469
9813. entries	are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information	retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary	operations is decreased.	8.080139376337113
9814. in sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations	of influences that can only be suggested here.	11.909012793224992
9815. the tendency is toward	putting dominant stress at the end.	12.204673387645432
9816. there is a parallel to this tendency	in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes.	21.52306330005694
9817. thus the	first lines of one of charles wesley's hymns are as follows.	13.15179892743178
9818. a charge to keep i have a god to glorify.	14.786088380021804
9819. in the	tune to which this hymn is most often sung boylston the syllables	have and fy ending their lines have twice the time any	other syllables have.	8.476399237487897
9820. dominant stress is of course more than extended	duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress	or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of	were spoken alone: a dominant stress given to glorify would normally	center on its first syllable rather than its last.	8.457112550018365
9821. but the parallel	is significant.	28.987746445070243
9822. when the answer to what's wrong now?	25.811654499803765
9823.  is bill's	broken a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement	a chair.	11.283686619270213
9824. from the point of view of syntactic analysis the	head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from	the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers	in the breaking; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken	only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence.	11.82865097816116
9825. in i know one	thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing;	in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know.	9.981165395596813
9826. in small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will	generally be on the complement very friendly; in the double sentence	the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally	be on the subjects the town and the people.	9.241728179818672
9827. in what's	a linguist?	28.00994552289681
9828.  dominant stress will generally be on the subject	a linguist; in who's a linguist?	10.971173409318752
9829.  it will generally be on	the complement a linguist.	20.541796642112335
9830. dominant stress is on her luggage	both in that's her luggage where her luggage is the complement	and in there's her luggage where it is the subject.	10.200757826826257
9831. adverbial	second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress	when they terminate sentences.	9.403959211459474
9832. if the answer to what was that noise?	24.409571533279873
9833. 	is george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily	be on the first complement the cat not the second complement	out.	8.76702917753222
9834. final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress.	18.871453068887742
9835. if the	answer to what was that noise?	16.122160126925362
9836.  is george reads the news emotionally	dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally.	15.487567530455335
9837. when prepositional complements are divided as in what are you	looking for?	11.801985816950635
9838.  they are likely to lose dominant stress.	25.181019185709186
9839. context	is of extreme importance.	14.19641732877796
9840. what is new in the context is likely	to be made more prominent than what is not.	15.695263957884
9841. thus in a context in which	there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is	new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows	here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local	weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows.	8.68084994267561
9842. the personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed	because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context.	11.839945775772456
9843. in i'll go with george dominant stress is probably on george;	but if george has just been mentioned prominently	what is said is probably	i'll go with him and dominant stress is probably on the preposition	with.	8.238210901657986
9844. when a gesture accompanies who's he?	23.602766992012366
9845.  the personal	pronoun has dominant stress because he has not been mentioned	previously.	13.003301136325648
9846. if both george and a piece of information george	does not have are prominent in the context but the idea of telling george	is new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why	not tell george?	10.980588902048254
9847.  but when what is new in a particular context	is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress	at all.	9.943590547721948
9848. thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets	its significance from its use with snows: nothing can snow snow	but it.	10.685034531074768
9849. in there aren't many young people in the neighborhood	the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head	people: the fact that the young creatures of interest are people	seems rather obvious.	9.767769893952947
9850. if women replaced people it would normally	have dominant stress.	16.150820779199535
9851. in i have things to do the word things	makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress	than do.	10.116916825998953
9852. if work is substituted for things	it will have dominant stress.	16.130641940767262
9853. in i	know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than	to semantically pale thing.	13.048048054550643
9854. in i knew you when you were a child	and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that	the young woman spoken to is still pretty.	10.234820400326466
9855. dominant stress on pretty	would be almost insulting here.	10.530932308755343
9856. in the written language then	can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here but much	of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness	and a careless reader will have to back up and reread.	11.601443113570392
9857. often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion.	10.213895751192704
9858. thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress	is likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong	stress also.	11.882329286263163
9859. in she has it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily	be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to	center.	9.0082069863666
9860. in we're painting at our garage strong stress on at	indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an	effort at painting.	10.07506465980604
9861. where there is comparison or contrast dominant	stresses normally operate to center attention.	11.254374053366822
9862. thus in his friends	are stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal for his	and sisters' but in his friends are stranger than his sisters	strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters.	9.66549728365765
9863. in	he's hurting himself more than he's hurting you both himself	and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if	there were no contrast.	7.556878632736834
9864. in is she chinese or japanese?	20.472413001720973
9865.  the	desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last	components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns	of stress of chinese and japanese.	7.302391158290319
9866. sometimes strong stress	serves to focus an important secondary relationship.	13.249045993286838
9867. thus in mary	wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks	mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip	strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series	of actions of mary's concerned with an account of her trip	and strong stress	on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about	which mary wrote accounts.	10.617952766350236
9868. in hunger stimulates man too the situation	is very similar.	15.872057262990682
9869. strong stress on hunger treats hunger as	an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation	as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats	man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger.	6.965981032758054
9870. here again in the written language it is possible to help the	reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much	of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light	of context.	10.942799504461982
9871. when a word represents a larger construction of	which it is the only expressed part it normally has more stress than	it would have in fully expressed construction.	9.937048309806933
9872. thus when yes i	have is the response to have you finished reading the paper?	12.646165227783504
9873. 	the stress on have which here represents have finished reading	the paper is quite strong.	8.62963042412541
9874. in mack's the leader at camp but	jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents	is the leader and therefore has stress.	10.781313030068256
9875. mack's the leader at	camp but jack's here with this is deprived of stress makes	here the complement in the clause.	7.9139724503302755
9876. in of all the suggestions that	were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents	his suggestion and is stressed.	11.91343137667445
9877. when go represents itself and	a complement in which	boat did jack go on?	11.288807818081464
9878.  it has strong stress; when it represents	only itself and on which is its complement	on has stronger stress	than go does.	13.54965732200279
9879. omission of a subordinator pronoun however does	not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which	the subordinator pronoun would be object.	8.073251234231604
9880. thus to has light stress	both in that was the conclusion that i came to and in that	was the conclusion i came to.	13.173943612897949
9881. but when to represents to consciousness	in that was the moment that i came to and similarly	in that was the moment i came to there is much stronger stress	on to.	11.899720573696943
9882. in i wanted to tell him but i was afraid to the final	to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him.	12.779609974939337
9883. in	to tell him of course to is normally unstressed.	11.689200547222619
9884. when i	have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i	have instructions that i am to leave this place dominant stress	is ordinarily on leave.	10.22991156812183
9885. when the same sequence is equivalent in	meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave dominant stress	is ordinarily on instructions.	9.843021608289266
9886. it is clear that patterns	of stress sometimes	show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where	without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written.	15.767604830023785
9887. i'll come by tuesday.	8.045217248147326
9888. i	can't be happy long without drinking water.	13.037321475654965
9889. in the first of these	sentences if by is the complement of come and tuesday is	an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong	stress on by in the spoken language; but if a complement for	come is implied and by tuesday is a prepositional unit used as	an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most.	8.173940656764035
9890. in	the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and	without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless	i drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on	drinking; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water	and without drinking water is equivalent to without water	for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on	water.	8.34685265491676
9891. but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example	can undermine distinctions such as these.	12.357274392836828
9892. and patterns of stress	are not always unambiguous by any means.	14.002188100682323
9893. in the steiners have	busy	lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting	relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives	or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked	up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings	of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically	a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed	by its object in the second.	7.789708486556248
9894. syllables are	linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but as	has been noted are consonantal under certain circumstances and which	may or may not be combined with preceding andor following consonants	or combinations of consonants.	9.081699650036743
9895. syllables are genuine units but division	of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties.	8.62963042412541
9896. sometimes	even the number of syllables is not clear.	14.571505980234376
9897. doubt on this point	is strongest before l and  or r.	9.669550099771405
9898. from the point of view	of	word formation real might be expected to have two syllables.	18.711222955654975
9899. historically	re is the formative that is employed also in republic	and al is the common suffix.	8.450640073948662
9900. when ity is added	real clearly has two syllables.	16.531820773994568
9901. but there is every reason to regard	deal as a monosyllable and because of the fact that l commonly	has the quality of  when it follows vowel sounds deal seems	to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real.	12.679453568399959
9902. it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less	successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels.	13.559190610536644
9903. no single explanation is adequate to account for this.	12.836443431242241
9904. improvement	however is urgent and at least three things will be needed.	11.880263214180378
9905. the first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses.	13.384391640401992
9906. even	beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable	variety of consonant systems both in their general outlines and in	many specific details.	9.158114121967879
9907. an advanced student has read a considerable	number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more	unusual types.	9.795088060860449
9908. by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know	no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple	distinction between register and contour languages.	11.546266294244749
9909. this limited	familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work	with tone.	11.84218474686041
9910. tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory	until a more representative selection of systems is familar to	every practicing field linguist.	10.70002138800984
9911. papers like these four if widely read	will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work.	8.450640073948662
9912. the second need is better field techniques.	18.796424706970367
9913. the great majority	of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping	types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed those who	are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who	are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in	those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed	with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole	matter.	8.935686495570431
9914. the result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial	treatment.	20.65497344520202
9915. as these maladies overlap so must the cure.	14.828246733426681
9916. analyses such	as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone	is impossible and that it is simple.	12.890330113091768
9917. they will give suggestions that	can be worked up into field procedures.	13.474363830075538
9918. good field techniques will not	only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative	attitudes.	10.737822901740167
9919. actually none of these papers says much directly about	field techniques.	12.012357678875505
9920. but it is worth pondering that very little has	been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics.	15.916242023410398
9921. these	things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake	of extensive publication of analytic results.	8.554739998967529
9922. the third need	is for better theory.	20.5532627245234
9923. we should expect that general phonologic theory	should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels but it has	not been.	9.793530208465967
9924. this can only be for one of two reasons: either the two	are quite different and will require totally different theory	or our existing theories are insufficiently general.	12.22569447996998
9925. if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development	of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically	in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.	8.906117806431904
9926. one issue	that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different	phonologic subsystems.	12.835829582102042
9927. since tone systems typically comprise fewer	units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they	would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis.	8.53901816522309
9928. actual practice	does not often work out this way.	12.3482207866056
9929. tone systems are certainly more complex	than the number of units would suggest and often analytically	more difficult than much larger consonantal systems.	8.357539397912783
9930. welmers has	suggested one explanation.	16.6462465444584
9931. tone languages use for linguistic contrasts	speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use.	8.62963042412541
9932. this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion	for the more knowledgeable.	16.98540461316455
9933. the problem is to disentangle the	linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic	features.	14.308799129148639
9934. of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of	the phonology: consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and	an individual component.	13.373620950268485
9935. but in general the individual variation is	a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude.	12.237759813584656
9936. with tone individual differences may be greater than the linguistic	contrasts which are superimposed on them.	11.65559349365635
9937. pitch differences from	one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far	exceed the small differences between tones.	7.811867791937725
9938. however any such suggestion	accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in	developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic	difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded.	9.848725985538454
9939. a second explanation is suggested by the material described in rowlands'	paper.	11.80298408026495
9940. tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed.	13.037321475654965
9941. neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate	the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the	other.	10.297802301646758
9942. other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap	in this way; for example duration sometimes figures in both the	vowel system and the intonation.	9.9420411656164
9943. some phonetic features for example	glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics	and sometimes to accentual systems.	8.841694107637236
9944. but no other two phonologic	systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in	some languages.	12.26893143254399
9945. this explanation of tone difficulties however does	not apply in all languages.	11.28868602154132
9946. in some	interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation	spans.	14.464296608871864
9947. in many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored	and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation.	13.750280700937022
9948. still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as	simple as one might expect.	11.930659242730638
9949. a third explanation is suggested	by richardson's analysis of sukuma tone.	12.358443222913962
9950. there we see a basically	simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic	system.	15.186525978659857
9951. while the phonemes can be very easily stated no one	is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences	can be related in some way to morphemic units ie until the morphophonemics	is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable	to expect success.	9.008923854227268
9952. in the typical tone language	tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal	morphophonemics.	15.158848868010601
9953. the phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic	systems however are very different.	11.022396334232088
9954. the inventory of tones	is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single	dimension pitch level.	11.895378476131494
9955. consonantal systems are not merely larger they	are multidimensional.	11.735378700610609
9956. morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining	certain points in the system.	12.71064859314332
9957. the possibilities in the consonantal	system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually	used.	10.915518055281774
9958. phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show	a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions	of contrast in the system.	9.593735817596315
9959. tonal morphophonemics in a common	case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone.	8.450640073948662
9960. the possibilities	are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater.	12.010194183656237
9961. often therefore there are a number of rules having the same	effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite	effect.	9.993341424127768
9962. tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning	analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number	of rules is no greater.	10.06492765017907
9963. the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem	in the phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller systems	are more troublesome- for any given degree of morphophonemic	complexity.	8.788473153385922
9964. this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties	of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are	often more puzzling than consonantal systems.	18.49311648490675
9965. the statement of the system	is a different matter.	19.12802793037202
9966. smaller systems can of course be stated	much more succinctly.	13.249540884807272
9967. a phonemic system can be stated without reference	to morphophonemics but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics.	9.246630530266595
9968. and the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation	to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed	without close attention to the morphophonemics- at least the less	satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through	morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures.	9.95754637058332
9969. the design of orthographies has received much less attention from	linguists than the problem deserves.	11.50172365674118
9970. there has been a tendency on the	part of many american linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription	will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only	real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance.	12.39510352547687
9971. most others have been content to give only the most	general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology	when designing orthographies.	9.889163879724617
9972. apparently the feeling is that	anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible	pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs.	9.616071439254972
9973. the result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography	conferences by such considerations as typographic 'esthetics'	which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices	carried over from european languages.	12.075638480404058
9974. many of the suggested systems	seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures	that they purport to represent.	13.51563448275639
9975. linguists have not always been	more enlightened than practical people and sometimes have insisted	on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater	significance.	7.634437488545556
9976. as a result many people have been confirmed in their	conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts	can contribute anything but confusion.	13.585540648977402
9977. a e sharp	in vowel-length and syllabicity in kikuyu examines one set of related	orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail.	8.50827903251417
9978. his	objective is merely to determine what distinctions of length and	syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography	.	10.711913785051436
9979. to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant	parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail.	14.931751323238407
9980. in the process he	develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort	that are often difficult.	16.06757606279908
9981. a few of his examples are of very great interest	and the whole discussion of some importance for theory.	11.1671466357069
9982. his orthographic	recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on	the one hand or of superficiality on the other.	10.21103487361586
9983. rather he weighs each	phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness.	13.78774985458693
9984. he concludes	that some changes can made in the current orthography which will	appreciably improve its usefulness but hesitates to suggest precise	graphic devices to effect these changes.	10.566894854658681
9985. i hope his suggestions are	given the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circles.	12.034767651495988
9986. this however	will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly	indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography	design.	10.496641604527243
9987. we need many more studies of this sort if the design	of written languages is to be put on a sound basis.	14.76116135088218
9988. one other	paper deals with a phonologic problem: vowel harmony in igbo by	j carnochan.	12.585813937402614
9989. this restates the already widely known facts in terms	of prosodies.	11.839384908174944
9990. as a restatement it makes only a small contribution	to knowledge of igbo.	15.298150693555652
9991. but it would seem more intended as a tract advocating	the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems	of igbo phonology.	13.593998892205398
9992. the paper has a certain value as a comparatively	easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats	a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible	to compare it with a more traditional statement.	10.286780239902107
9993. it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously	described.	21.445073495587547
9994. but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could	not be treated by traditional methods.	15.737593900816465
9995. it seems to me that it rather	easily can.	37.963335941319286
9996. five of the papers deal with grammatical problems.	19.520241301078137
9997. on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they	are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider	variety of subject matter.	10.709142220737663
9998. my comments must be briefer than the papers	deserve.	13.66962357984763
9999. w h whiteley writes on the verbal radical	in iraqw.	10.251173908567152
10000. this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement	to his early a short description of item-categories in iraqw.	12.593619529282773
